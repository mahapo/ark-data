>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Candace Silvers

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:10%
is a human behavioral
expert and lifestyle coach.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:10%
She continues her work out

"The Sixth Floor -
Expanding Possibility."

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:84%
In this film,
seeing is believing,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
with jaw-dropping footage as
we witnessed Balinese master

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.100 align:middle line:90%
healers at work.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Today, Candace and
I connect the dots

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
between these sacred
healing modalities,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, the body,
the behavior, and us, here

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the part
that has to be made.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody can go to Bali,
but wow, the ones who can have

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
had some really
amazing experiences.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:90%
So welcome.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CANDACE SILVERS: Thank you.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's good to see you.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Last time I saw you was about
10 years ago in your home.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Correct.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Long time ago.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.185 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I remember.

00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it was fun.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:10%
And so now we're
here, and you've

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:10%
had these incredible
experiences that

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:10%
have been documented in this
film that we just mentioned.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:10%
But for those of you who
are new to your work,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:10%
as it's a whole new audience
with Gaia, some whom

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:10%
will know you, some
whom will not, let's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:10%
start here with
the whole journey

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:10%
and how you started
really observing behavior

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:10%
in a deeper way than
some might by being

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:10%
in the company of your father.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
The wild and crazy people-- the
man we know is Phil Silvers,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
your childhood,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and how that began for
you, and how you began

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:90%
became intrigued with behavior.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you were in a world
that was really fantasy,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, and then
reality on another level.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Yeah, I don't
think I knew the difference.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:10%
I don't think there--

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:10%
for me, my father on TV and
my father standing next to me

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:10%
were the same.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:10%
So without knowing that
R-E-A-L and R-E-E-L--

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:10%
well, flip that.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Because TV was R-E-E-L,
and my father was R-E-A-L.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:90%
But they were the same to me.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.693 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know--

00:02:08.693 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I
didn't know, but I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that
what I was seeing

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:90%
wasn't actually happening.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to this day, I
can't see a scary movie

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.367 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know how
to see that as not real.

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, I think that's--

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.950 align:middle line:10%
I mean, first of all, I think
that is part of being human,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:10%
that we're all living in
some sort of illusion.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.077 align:middle line:10%
You just got literally the
Hollywood version of it.

00:02:28.077 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: To some degree.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that might have been
the entrance into something

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:84%
that was going on
that I didn't know.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was that I was
born with the ability

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:90%
to understand human behavior.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see the outsides.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I still don't, and that
can get me into trouble.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But what someone is saying
when their lips aren't moving.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Their body language, how they
hold their hand or blink,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
tells me what, neurologically,
is going on for them,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as what it's
going to produce.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So even when
you're a little kid,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:90%
you had these abilities.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:10%
So what is it like
living in a land that

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:10%
is known for extreme
behaviors because it requires

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:10%
an extreme talent to
come out of people to be

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:10%
able to live in that world?

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: My stock answer is
I didn't know the difference.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.227 align:middle line:84%
People would say,
what's it like to have

00:03:24.227 --> 00:03:26.095 align:middle line:90%
your father be so famous?

00:03:26.095 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
what's it like to have

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.132 align:middle line:90%
your father be a plumber?

00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Be an
insurance salesman.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: [LAUGHS] So I think
I didn't know I didn't know.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't know
that the people were acting,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, in more extreme
ends of behavioral--

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.857 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I just
knew I didn't like it.

00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, tell me that part.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Well, I watched--

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:84%
in Beverly Hills
High School in 1979,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
children were
committing suicide.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was long
before it became,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.455 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, culturally
average, where--

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
because this is a part of
life I think a lot of people

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
don't comprehend
because they've never

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:90%
been cast in these circles.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:90%
About--

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Distress?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --the
notion of what happens

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:10%
when people are in extremely
either high profile

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:10%
or privileged positions or
highly moneyed positions.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:90%
So many of them end up so lost.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I don't
think that's just

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Beverly Hills or Hollywood.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.713 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's in the world.

00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I think it was
prevalent at that time where it

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
wasn't necessarily so
prevalent in other areas that--

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:84%
the head of Universal Studios'
son went to school with us.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:90%
And Dean Martin's kid--

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just everybody.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
It was a very small town,
and we all knew each other.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.275 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't,
how are you today?

00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%
It was, what does
your father do?

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.637 align:middle line:90%
What kind of car does he drive?

00:04:51.637 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how can
you ever keep up?

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Is my house
bigger than your house?

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.740 align:middle line:90%
You can't keep up.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't keep up.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
you could keep up with.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.040 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't take my attention.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I was born a vegetarian with
a lisp who couldn't read well

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:90%
who wanted to dance.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And I had four sisters
who were debaters

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and straight-A students
who were meat eaters

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and didn't have a lisp.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was very clear
that I was different

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:84%
from the very beginning,
even from my twin sister.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
think about that

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:10%
and what you just
said about the way

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:10%
the kids would respond and
interact with each other.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.065 align:middle line:10%
Now, fortunately, you
had your own little gig

00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:10%
going on as a soul.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:10%
But, I mean, just to build some
compassion, a bit of compassion

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.115 align:middle line:10%
Because oftentimes
people tend to be

00:05:35.115 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:10%
less compassionate
with those who

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:10%
seem to be endowed with
more in the material world.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:10%
And the reality is,
that has a huge price

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:10%
tag that comes with it.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I think no matter who
we are, we come a full package.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.518 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Whether we
come with nothing--

00:05:48.518 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
but that causes
some of that drive

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond the self to
see and be inquisitive.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.950 align:middle line:90%
We come with too much.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's an Einstein
in every mental institution.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
They just couldn't have one
foot in the future, which

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:90%
they could see clearly.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
One foot in the present
that they belong to,

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.997 align:middle line:90%
consciously or unconsciously.

00:06:07.997 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
able to bring it back

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:84%
where the people in the
present could understand it.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
believe that, too.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERS: And in order to numb
them and get them to fit in,

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.773 align:middle line:10%
and they felt
insane because they

00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:10%
knew they knew what they knew,
but they couldn't share it.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
I agree with that.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:84%
That would be my
observation, too.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm just
picking on this one area

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's a glimpse inside
something most people don't

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:84%
see, and that is
there's this thing

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.065 align:middle line:84%
that happens in people once
they, no matter who they are,

00:06:35.065 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:84%
have made their
mark in the world.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:84%
That it takes a fair amount
of will, or focus, ego--

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:90%
all of these things--

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:90%
to get to that place.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, they're
good at what they're good at.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're good
at what they're good at.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: But what about the
things they're not good at?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And we point
to what you're good at.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you're good at that,
and you have money, property,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and prestige, then
you should just

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
be good at all
these other things.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's not true.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Ever.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.342 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you stop and think

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that that is what
they're good at.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And that means not necessarily
stepping aside and spending

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.883 align:middle line:84%
the rest of your time nurturing
the genius in your children.

00:07:09.883 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I think we're
all put on the planet

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:90%
for the same reason.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think we are all
doing the exact same thing

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
from, Mother Teresa to Hitler
to Jeffrey Dahmer to Gandhi,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
is from the moment we take our
first breath until the moment

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:84%
after our last breath,
the only thing we all

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.995 align:middle line:90%
have in common is learning.

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERS: We are learning
to take that breath.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.270 align:middle line:84%
We are learning
what we don't know.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.460 align:middle line:84%
We're learning that we're too
good in this area, but don't--

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.927 align:middle line:84%
I can make $100 million
a year, but my wife

00:07:38.927 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:84%
is having an affair
with the pool man.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Why, if
I'm so good over here,

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:90%
does she not love me?

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So we have no choice but to be
ushered into the beyond what

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I know because the pain of
not being able to get access

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
to my wife or whatever
that is causes

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.645 align:middle line:90%
us to have to go looking.

00:07:56.645 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:10%
So you went looking, OK?

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.830 align:middle line:10%
And so now this part of
your journey-- and we're

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.425 align:middle line:10%
going to be showing
clips of this film.

00:08:05.425 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:90%
This part of your journey--

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: By the
way, I had nothing

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.447 align:middle line:90%
to do with this documentary.

00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's OK.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:09.775 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Nothing.

00:08:09.775 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're in it.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: It was filmed.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
You're in it, and
it has these people,

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and these Balinese
healers, which

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:90%
you have taken people to see.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:90%
You are involved with them.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:90%
You have trained with them.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.108 align:middle line:84%
And so production
quality, whatever aside--

00:08:24.108 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:90%
we don't talk about that.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about the content.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:10%
So where in your journey
did the real healer portion

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:10%
start coming to the forefront,
and what then took you

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:10%
into indigenous lands?

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Great questions.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So I have been healing
people my whole life.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I've been hiding it from
everyone because I was already

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.280 align:middle line:90%
different enough.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what I
knew or what I didn't know.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I started Kundalini
yoga when I was 15.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:90%
I started meditating at 15.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:84%
This was not only not
in our society anywhere,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:90%
it was really frowned upon.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I did Kundalini
yoga with the Sikhs,

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and knew if my
mother found out, I

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:84%
would be told I
could never go back.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.367 align:middle line:84%
So I lied and said I was
going to dance class.

00:09:16.367 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
People would come to me and
say, I have to have surgery.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'd wave my hand
over them, and they

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:90%
didn't need the surgery.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.343 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't tell anyone
because how do you

00:09:24.343 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:84%
tell someone you could
do that, and how do you

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:90%
believe that you did that?

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.477 align:middle line:10%
Did you know how you
were doing that at all?

00:09:33.477 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I knew I could do it.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know how I was doing.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
know how it worked.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: But I could cause it,
and I could teach it to people.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And I have thousands and
thousands of clients.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And they knew I could
do it because they

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
were open to it
because they were part

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:84%
of seeing the miracles that I
was able to produce with all

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
of our company together that
allowed them to experience, OK,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:90%
we've gone through the mirror.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
We've gone beyond our
minds because that doesn't

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:90%
happen when I'm thinking.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And I can't produce
it with desire.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.035 align:middle line:84%
To desire is to give
birth to, to "de-sire."

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:90%
To sire, to give birth to.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And I can't make my
mind desire that.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I can only find
myself present there.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted
more and more of that.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I would raise my
hand and say, avatar.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And what would seem like a 747
jet would fly through my home.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'd have 50 or 60
people sitting there.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And God's very kind to me
in that God-nature totality

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
in that he's allowed me
to have people present.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of it's been filmed.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not one of those
people in a mental institution

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.532 align:middle line:84%
feeling like right a blathering
idiot, but some of them

00:10:44.532 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
have been able to
connect the dots.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But how
long did it take

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.153 align:middle line:10%
before you could speak publicly
about it without feeling

00:10:49.153 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:10%
like you'd be humiliated?

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Once I
went to Bali and I

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
began to study in this
hospital with Ratu Nabe.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And he began to teach me how
to bring his healing through.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's as though
you had the raw talent,

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
but you can't say, oh,
I know how to do this.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You had to go find someone
who was already validated,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, and had methods.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, not
validated in America.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he's--

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, but for you.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Yes.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and teach
you this method so you could

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:90%
come back and say, I have this.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I have been healing
people for the last 20,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:84%
25 years, and those
that do come to me

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
are very clear that it
works, and it happens.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to train several
people to be able to do this--

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:90%
my healing that comes through.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then why did you
go do the indigenous thing?

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I didn't.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Just like the
documentary I didn't make,

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:84%
someone said to me, I'm going
with you on this retreat,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:90%
and I've been with you 10 times.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
know if I can film it.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
She's a client for
10 years, and she

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
was a producer on
"Beast of No Nations,"

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and I really believed
in her integrity.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, film it.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I never let people film it
because it's not logical.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.353 align:middle line:84%
My interest is not to get
it to people that want

00:12:06.353 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:90%
to laugh and make fun of it.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:84%
My interest is
create the red carpet

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:84%
or the Red Sea's
parting that allow

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:90%
us to find ourselves here.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So I said to Tommee May, you are
absolutely welcome to film it,

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
having no idea would
ever become anything.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.305 align:middle line:90%
The same way, I got to Bali--

00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:22.505 align:middle line:90%
I was in India.

00:12:22.505 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
It was my seventh or eighth
year doing retreats in India.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.415 align:middle line:84%
And I ran into an American
man in an ashram meditating.

00:12:30.415 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
me, and he said,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:32.915 align:middle line:90%
have you ever been to Bali?

00:12:32.915 --> 00:12:34.055 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:12:34.055 --> 00:12:35.180 align:middle line:90%
He said, do you want to go?

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, here's a business
card of a driver there.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.340 align:middle line:90%
If you ever go, call him.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And three years later, I
looked at one of my assistants,

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and I said, does
anybody have that card?

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.845 align:middle line:84%
And Leslie pulled it out
and said, I found it.

00:12:52.845 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, call him.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Set up a retreat.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's time.

00:12:55.303 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: It's time.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And a few months later,
25 of us were in Bali.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
we met Cokorda Rai.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And I took with me three
clients who were very ill.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.910 align:middle line:84%
One with HIV, one
with Graves' disease,

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:90%
and one with a brain tumor.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:84%
My 25-year-old client
with a brain tumor,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:84%
they said that she
was going blind

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.828 align:middle line:84%
and would not be able
to have children.

00:13:18.828 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they were
kind of at their wits' end

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.115 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:13:22.115 --> 00:13:23.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, I shouldn't say that.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: They
were in a quandary.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
were in a quandary.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: They were
all in their 20s.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Had they gone
through medical treatment,

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.420 align:middle line:84%
or are they thinking, we
can do it this magical way?

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: No, no, no.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
They were all free
in medical treatment.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.523 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And I said, if
you go to Bali with me--

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know why say
these things, Regina.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why they happen.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.385 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:13:41.385 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But I said, if you
go to Bali with me--

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:90%
this was our first time going.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.988 align:middle line:84%
I said, you'll all
come back healed.

00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a big promise.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing
you delivered, huh?

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.385 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: How do you know?

00:13:52.385 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:90%
They all came back healed.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we got back, I said
to Darwin, go check your HIV.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later,
I said, did you do it?

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, Candace, once you
have HIV, it doesn't go away,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
so no one's going
to check it again.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:90%
I said, hey, silly.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Go down the street where
they don't know you

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:90%
and have it checked.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So two weeks later, I'm like,
why is he not calling me?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I called him.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, I went, he said.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:90%
But they lost my blood test.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.743 align:middle line:84%
I said, Darwin, they didn't
lose your blood test.

00:14:22.743 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:90%
They're in a quandary.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea
what's going on.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:90%
So I said, call them back again.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.415 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, they
said, we can't find it.

00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:90%
We need to retest you.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:90%
So he went back again.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And three weeks later,
they called him and said,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what to
make of this because--

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:84%
it's like you're either
pregnant or you're not.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:90%
You can't be a little pregnant.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if you have
HIV, all nine cylinders

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.990 align:middle line:90%
show that secretion for HIV.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't,
none of them do.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yours
are only showing six.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So you've actually
broken the chain,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:90%
and we don't understand it.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And this was 10 or 11 years ago.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Long before we've
gotten to the brilliance

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:84%
we've gotten to now
with modern medicine.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.952 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And the girl
with Graves' disease,

00:15:06.952 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:90%
now it's been 10 years.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't have
Graves' disease anymore.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And the girl with the
brain tumor-- gone.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.640 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I hadn't
met Ratu Nabe yet.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:90%
We only had one healer there.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I have 15 or 20 healers
I use there now.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:90%
But we only had Ratu Nabe--

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm sorry, Cokorda.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you how it
happened except that my work--

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
if you know Sanskrit,
they say that Sanskrit

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:84%
is the only non-describing
language on the planet,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and every other
language describes.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I am Candace.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:90%
You are Regina.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:90%
We are going there.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As
opposed to Sanskrit.

00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Nothing is present.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Sanskrit invokes.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you say the word,
you're actually invoking.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:84%
There's no thought,
there is just cause.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:90%
And for some strange reason, I--

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In Sanskrit, how
would you, for example, present

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:90%
yourself and your name?

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:90%
What would that sound like?

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Oh, I have no idea.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.107 align:middle line:90%
I don't know Sanskrit.

00:16:04.107 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I mean
spiritually, so to speak.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't say, I am?

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: No, you would--

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I am Candace, OK.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:90%
I am Candace.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: No, not I am,
because I am is over there.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:13.588 align:middle line:90%
I am is pointing to.

00:16:13.588 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what did they say?

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:90%
What would they say?

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Candace.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.758 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just Candace.

00:16:17.758 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't identify or describe.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Where you're
located isn't Candace.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Candace.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:90%
It's Candace.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I am--

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.848 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
interesting, yeah.

00:16:28.848 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --isn't necessary
because Candace is.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And for
some strange reason,

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
over these last 30
years, I have come

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.365 align:middle line:84%
to terms with that I
am teaching Sanskrit.

00:16:42.365 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But when you first
come to me, it

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:48.113 align:middle line:84%
can be a little
discombobulating or frustrating

00:16:48.113 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
talk about things.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:90%
I cause them.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And after five or 10 weeks of
practicing with me, so can you.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.360 align:middle line:90%
I teach a class once a year--

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of people--
called the Foundation.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
It is the eight tools
that I use to teach how

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:90%
to go from thought to heart.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So I always say,
head below heart.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:90%
Head, intellect.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:90%
State, below heart, church.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:84%
Center, where we're
all connected.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.800 align:middle line:10%
And when the head,
the intellect, it's

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:10%
below the heart in a
bow, the heart is louder.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.075 align:middle line:84%
It will take you
anywhere you want to go.

00:17:24.075 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
The first time you have
a thought about that,

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.623 align:middle line:84%
or a condition to that,
or a opinion about it,

00:17:30.623 --> 00:17:31.665 align:middle line:90%
you're back to your head.

00:17:31.665 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Expectation,
all of it, yeah.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And it's very
dangerous for people

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
not to be in their
heads because we're

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:90%
trained to be in her heads.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: But after 10 days--

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:84%
I just got back from a
10-day retreat in Marrakesh

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:41.730 align:middle line:90%
with my clients.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And after 10 days of being in--
because I work from 10:00 AM

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:90%
until 11:00 PM.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.942 align:middle line:90%
We don't take breaks.

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:90%
We don't have time off.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't have--
we work together,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:90%
and we travel together.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that, people
can see beyond what they know.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is the beginning, the
entrance, into I want more.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I want to know why life
is so precious when

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm not thinking about life.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and when
you're actually in the present.

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Which is an epidemic
among humanity, is

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.290 align:middle line:90%
we're not in the present.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: But in the

>>SILVERS: So now that I

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I can actually
explain to what it is.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But he's touching her
in very specific points

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.893 align:middle line:90%
to see where the blocks are.

00:23:29.893 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I have to you a
little bit harder.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.400 align:middle line:90%
He barely touches you.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.130 align:middle line:84%
He's been doing this
since he was 15.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.800 align:middle line:84%
He barely touches
you, and it really

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:90%
feels like a hammer hit you.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:84%
He then knows
where the block is.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
He then puts the energy into
her that dissipates the block

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:90%
and takes it out.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And he can use a cupping
hand motion to get it deeper.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And if it's in the bone, if it's
somewhere deeper in the body.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.460 align:middle line:90%
And then he pulls it out.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
You see him draw his hand
down to pull the energy out.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:84%
He'll then go back and put a
healing energy to replace it.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:84%
It happens quite quickly,
but there is a lot going on.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you see him poking,
he's not really poking.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.060 align:middle line:84%
If you look again, he's
barely touching her.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:90%
But it feels like poking.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:90%

the people that have
gone over there--

00:24:26.322 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:90%
get there in this experience?

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.947 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I don't take anyone
who isn't a client of mine.

00:24:29.947 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't take lookie-loos.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I will do three
retreats back to back,

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.260 align:middle line:90%
but 20 to 25 people at a time.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.280 align:middle line:90%
We don't get multiple buses.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't a
moneymaking venture.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:84%
This is really to
journey people.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:90%
I do all of this to melt minds.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.255 align:middle line:90%
I don't do it to heal people.

00:24:46.255 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment
you're healed,

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.480 align:middle line:84%
you just run into
the next uh-oh,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a divorce
or your mother.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what life is about.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But to melt the mind
that if this is possible,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.382 align:middle line:90%
what else is there?

00:25:00.382 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one of the other
people that you talked about,

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:84%
which we'll go to in a
minute, was-- how do you say,

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:90%
"Kuh-kor-dah"?

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Oh, Cokorda.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Cokorda Rai.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cokorda Rai.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.997 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about Cokorda Rai.

00:25:11.997 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, he and I
have been working together 10,

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:90%
11 years now.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:90%
He's very, very old now.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.800 align:middle line:84%
He's not really
with us anymore in--

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.570 align:middle line:90%
his body's still here.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But back then, he was someone
that anyone that went to Bali

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:90%
could find.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:90%
You could ask a cab driver.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
You could ask in any
restaurant in a booth,

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and they would take
you to Cokorda Rai.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the Four
Seasons, they charge $800

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.200 align:middle line:84%
to take you to
Cokorda Rai, which

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.640 align:middle line:84%
is so silly because you can just
find him from a cab for $40.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
But he's the go-to healer.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're in Bali,
you're pretty much not

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.487 align:middle line:90%
going to meet a real healer.

00:25:49.487 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You're going to meet the people
that put on the show for the--

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:90%
what they call [NON-ENGLISH].

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:54.875 align:middle line:90%
The white people.

00:25:54.875 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tourists.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: The tourists.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, somehow I've
been able to get people

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.700 align:middle line:84%
to trust me enough that
are indigenous to take me

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.610 align:middle line:84%
to the local healers
that really are healers.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:11.103 align:middle line:90%
Cokorda Rai is--

00:26:11.103 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
have a favorite,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:84%
but he's one of my favorite
people on the planet.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us why
before we take a-- so

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.400 align:middle line:84%
we want to get your take on
him before we show the clip.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERS: He's so kind,
and generous, and connected,

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:10%
and personable, and available,
and aware, and clear.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing going
on but what he's doing.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And again, every
one of these healers

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.750 align:middle line:84%
has designed their
own healing trait.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not go to the healing
school of Hogwarts.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.955 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.955 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Ratu Nabe, Teacher
Man, found this

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:84%
by sitting in his
family's cemetery at 15.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Cokorda found this
by-- he was a bad guy.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:84%
He was the motorcycle kind
of bad guys, drink too much,

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:90%
and run around with women.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he heard the
calling, and he ignored it

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and ignored it and ignored it,
and found himself in a coma.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.400 align:middle line:90%
And in that coma--

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did he
end up in the coma?

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I can't
tell you that.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:11.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm not--

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't--

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I don't remember.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.930 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERS: And came
out of the coma

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.490 align:middle line:10%
and knew he had to
become a healer,

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:10%
and trained himself in
the work that you see.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.010 align:middle line:84%
He touches your
toes to see where

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:90%
the blocks are in your body.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And he'll go to the body,
and he'll do these yantras

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:90%
that he's created.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's taught hundreds of
people how to do his work.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So as he leaves the planet,
he leaves the work here.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:84%
German people and Japanese
people and Australian people

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:90%
have really practiced his work.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.955 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen them
there practicing it.

00:27:46.955 --> 00:27:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think this is one of
the things-- most people watch

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:90%
this and say, oh, well, great.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's an indigenous person.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Probably learned it from his
mother or his grandfather

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.440 align:middle line:84%
or someone, and how
can we ever do that.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
these are innate tools

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.640 align:middle line:90%
every human being has.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.100 align:middle line:10%
You just have to have the
confidence and awareness

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.882 align:middle line:10%
and know-how, and a desire
to be of service, right?

00:28:09.882 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: It is
one of the reasons

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm training people here.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not for
everyone, and we don't

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:84%
take everyone that asks to
learn because in this, you

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
have to know that if you get
angry while you're a healer,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:90%
you're going to hurt yourself.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like
giving a four-year-old fire

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and sending them
alone to their room.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a devotion.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not a hat trick.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not the new thing
we're doing right now.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%

that you see--

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you see a lot
of anger management issues,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:90%
they don't come?

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, they
come to my classes,

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and they learn to understand
where the anger is coming from.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And. they look underneath it.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're not
going to be trained into this.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: If they
come to a place

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.932 align:middle line:84%
where anger doesn't
rule their light,

00:28:49.932 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
or they're not addicted to it,
yeah, then absolutely they can.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:90%
I just know that it's my dharma.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And if I train you and you're
not ready, it becomes my karma.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not interested in that.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.700 align:middle line:84%

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:84%

00:30:47.153 --> 00:30:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I don't
think it's arrogance.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:90%
I think it's fear.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
just ignorance, too.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Not having exposure.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: But remember,
to ignore something,

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:84%
being ignorant,
you have to ignore.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to ignore it, yeah.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: You have to
know it's already there,

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:84%
but you're not
ready to look yet.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.425 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I don't
see right and wrong.

00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:03.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't see good and bad.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't see people that won't.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.893 align:middle line:84%
I see everyone
coming to the center.

00:31:07.893 --> 00:31:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a much
healthier way to look at it.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I look at it and
think, why can't we

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
just let go and start to
embrace some of this other--

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: But look
at what peace is.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not P-I-E-C-E,
it's P-E-A-C-E.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn to understand
not to have an opinion about.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there
are bad people.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone's
doing the best they can,

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:33.998 align:middle line:84%
and it's unfortunate that
is the best they can.

00:31:33.998 --> 00:31:35.290 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't make them bad.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It gives them opportunity
of a new place to walk,

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
should they choose
to in this lifetime.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:10%
On the other hand,
I also think there

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:10%
are very specific
means about going about

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:10%
in creating ridicule
in the Western world

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:10%
for other factions to be able to
keep the profit margins going.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Don't look to the
natural healing.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.208 align:middle line:84%
Don't look to validate people
like these lovely individuals.

00:32:00.208 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I don't
disagree with you,

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.120 align:middle line:84%
but you can't fix
something broken.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.520 align:middle line:90%
But you can see something whole.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can, and you
can go around that and make

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.090 align:middle line:90%
your own choices of engagement.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But it still ticks
me off that it's

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:84%
being ridiculed in this
country, because that time

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:84%
has to come to an
end at some point.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I know one of the
heads of Cedars-Sinai Cancer,

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and I called everyone
I knew to get in there.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And they all said,
sorry, you can't.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:26.350 align:middle line:90%
We can't.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.830 align:middle line:90%
It can't.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:27.630 align:middle line:90%
We won't.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And someone sent
a young lady to me

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:84%
who needed desperately
to have a healing.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:35.020 align:middle line:84%
She had stage IV cancer
come back in her spine.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:90%
About 35 years old.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Had to slipped disks.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't use her right arm.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't use her right leg.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Someone brought her to
me about four months ago.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And she looked me in the
eye with tears and said,

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:84%
my dream is, when I get
married in four months,

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to be able to walk
down the aisle.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And after I did the first
healing on her, I said,

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I promise you you'll be
able to walk down the aisle.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure you'll be able
to stand the whole time,

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.220 align:middle line:84%
but you'll be able to
walk down the aisle.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And I took her through
some techniques

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:middle line:84%
to begin practicing
walking after we

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:90%
put the slipped disks back in.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.470 align:middle line:84%
She came back a week later,
and she was off her walker.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:17.440 align:middle line:84%
She had full control
over her hand.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:10%
I was walking out of a
movie theater the other day,

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.110 align:middle line:10%
and my assistant sent me a
picture of her not only walking

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:26.410 align:middle line:10%
down the aisle, but dancing
with her father at her wedding.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.060 align:middle line:10%
And I literally--

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.910 align:middle line:10%
I just started heave-crying
at what's possible.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:90%
If you believe in possibility--

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I always say believe
in the unbelievable

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.560 align:middle line:84%
until the unbelievable
becomes believable.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Don't talk about what's not
believable ever for any reason

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
because you're
wasting your time.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:51.450 align:middle line:84%
She was working with one of the
heads of Cedars-Sinai Cancer.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what on
earth have you done?

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And she talked about me.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:59.862 align:middle line:84%
And we now have a pilot
program at Cedars-Sinai

00:33:59.862 --> 00:34:01.570 align:middle line:84%
where they're studying
all of my clients.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is so exciting.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: But this isn't
not yellow pages, Google,

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:08.040 align:middle line:90%
friends-of-friends research.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.650 align:middle line:84%
This is all just doing
what's in front of you,

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:13.389 align:middle line:84%
and not looking at
what isn't working,

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.449 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that
God will guide you.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's to Bali,
or to Cedars-Sinai,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.250 align:middle line:84%
or wherever it is
you need to be.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.150 align:middle line:90%
There's no opinion.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:90%
There's just serve.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how's this
happen in Cedars-Sinai?

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.850 align:middle line:84%
How are they going
to engage with this?

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well,
they're not allowed

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to bring us in because
of all of the red tape.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.659 align:middle line:84%
But they are sending
clients to me.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working on them, and
then I'm sending them back,

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.489 align:middle line:90%
and they're doing the research.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the blood
tests and the X-rays

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and whatever it is on
that particular client

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.130 align:middle line:84%
that they need to work
with so that they can see,

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:53.909 align:middle line:84%
as their clients are going into
NED, No Evidence of Disease.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:90%
In America, we know remission.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:00.030 align:middle line:84%
My cancer is in remission,
and everybody gets so excited.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know NED,
which is shocking to me,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.520 align:middle line:84%
because NED is no
evidence of disease.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And I have hundreds
of clients now.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I work on pictures remotely,
as well as in person, that--

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
two-year-olds, 50-year-olds,
people with brain tumors.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not gone away
for the time being.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not better.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:84%
There is no evidence of disease
ever having been in their body.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So Cedars is now-- we're
in a pilot program where

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:36.090 align:middle line:84%
they're doing the research
so that eventually--

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:39.090 align:middle line:90%
time has no meaning to me.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Time and I broke up
a long time ago. .

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know time.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.460 align:middle line:84%
But I do know we
will be in Cedars,

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and there will be a room for
chemo, a room for cutting off

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.160 align:middle line:90%
limbs, and a room for healers.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.175 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be able to choose.

00:35:52.175 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
you're right on that.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.383 align:middle line:10%
And it's this kind
of study that's

00:35:55.383 --> 00:35:56.550 align:middle line:10%
going to make that possible.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: That's right.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so is it
any particular department

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.300 align:middle line:90%
you're engaged with?

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.508 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Right now, cancer.

00:36:01.508 --> 00:36:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cancer, OK.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.600 align:middle line:90%
And you've done this.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.497 align:middle line:90%
So you--

00:36:04.497 --> 00:36:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: It's happening.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:90%
It's occurring.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.162 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's occurring.

00:36:07.162 --> 00:36:08.730 align:middle line:90%
You have the experience already.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You have the evidence by
people who, as you say,

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.940 align:middle line:90%
are in the NED state.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Correct.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.657 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And this is a
really big part of it,

00:36:15.657 --> 00:36:20.800 align:middle line:10%
is people may understand, like
watching this interview, that's

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:10%
in me, too.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.730 align:middle line:10%
I can do this.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:29.010 align:middle line:10%
But the process of developing
confidence in oneself

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.192 align:middle line:10%
is a big part of all of this.

00:36:31.192 --> 00:36:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: You
know, that's my job.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.530 align:middle line:84%
My job is to show
them impossible.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And when they see
Impossible, they

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:90%
go, OK, what else is there?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's more
and more and more.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And organically,
things that weren't

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:84%
working, that were
broken, that were

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.850 align:middle line:84%
out of order, that
were impossible,

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:49.025 align:middle line:90%
they just show up on them.

00:36:49.025 --> 00:36:50.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not the
doer of the deed.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.290 align:middle line:84%
They're the receiver
of the deed.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And they are inspired
to play the game.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.330 align:middle line:90%
They then want more.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.680 align:middle line:90%
It's an organic walk.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.740 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's different.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not everyone
becomes the same.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:05.310 align:middle line:84%
They're all looking for
what they're looking for.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:84%
But when we step through the
mirror to the other side and we

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.870 align:middle line:84%
see that the only thing
we couldn't take with us

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:14.790 align:middle line:84%
was our mind, but that we got
so much more than our mind.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.663 align:middle line:84%
And we can look
back and say, wow,

00:37:16.663 --> 00:37:19.080 align:middle line:84%
my mind is so much smaller
than I thought it was because I

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.080 align:middle line:90%
never thought to think--

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.881 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:22.950 align:middle line:84%
We all mistake our
own field of vision

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:84%
for the field of
vision of the world.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:90%
We have so many filters.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And when we
see that all I have to do

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:30.780 align:middle line:84%
is go beyond what I know, and
there lies everything else.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It is a field with which
awaits the play of the game.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:84%
These are the people that are
coming to me, whether they have

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.280 align:middle line:84%
seen the documentary on Gaia,
or they've heard about it

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.092 align:middle line:90%
through a friend.

00:37:43.092 --> 00:37:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Because now I have
healers that are

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.890 align:middle line:90%
in Spain and across America.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.200 align:middle line:84%
They're coming to me to
learn how to do this.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And once they're ready, I
can teach them in six weeks.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's
the part I was talking about.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.400 align:middle line:84%
You learn the means
of reading energy,

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.040 align:middle line:84%
you learn the means of balancing
the energy, and so forth.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:90%
The confidence.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.470 align:middle line:90%
To gain the confidence.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Nope.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't gain the
confidence first.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.070 align:middle line:84%
You heal someone
with your hands.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like when a baby
walks, half the time.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm saying, you have
to do it and see the results.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.900 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERS: The first time
I took a group to Bali,

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.540 align:middle line:10%
and the first group
that became healers--

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.020 align:middle line:10%
I'll never forget Ali.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:27.330 align:middle line:10%
I had taken a suite in the hotel
so we had a room for training.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And I laid someone
down on the bed,

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and I said to the young girl who
trains the dogs for the police

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:90%
department.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.660 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, go touch her.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.950 align:middle line:90%
And the woman had broken spine.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.780 align:middle line:90%
And she did a healing on her.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And the woman got up, and her
spine was no longer broken.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:48.110 align:middle line:84%
You would think that
this woman met God.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.343 align:middle line:90%
Ali was jumping up and down.

00:38:49.343 --> 00:38:51.260 align:middle line:84%
She kept leaving the
room and running back in,

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and looking at
her, and screaming.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is the confidence
that is due all of us.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Our biggest
stumbling block is we

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.967 align:middle line:84%
have little faith in
ourselves because we

00:39:02.967 --> 00:39:04.550 align:middle line:84%
don't understand the
immensity of what

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.840 align:middle line:90%
we're capable of already.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I also think this
work is building that faith.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:09.265 --> 00:39:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: It's not when
you have faith, you can.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It's come little
children, come to the feet

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:17.120 align:middle line:90%
of see what's possible.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.160 align:middle line:90%
And they join.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I find that in my own life.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:23.125 align:middle line:84%
You do it, and you
say, did that happen?

00:39:23.125 --> 00:39:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And now the confidence
starts building and building

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:27.390 align:middle line:84%
where, over time,
it's just natural.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.612 align:middle line:84%
You just know, and coming
into that state of knowing.

00:39:29.612 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERS: And then, as they
begin to do the healing,

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.610 align:middle line:10%
they start to see they can
actually look at a body

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:37.033 align:middle line:10%
and see where the ailment is.

00:39:37.033 --> 00:39:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Because your mind,
body, spirit is

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.080 align:middle line:90%
getting trained to understand.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.725 align:middle line:84%
And you teach them
that top to bottom?

00:39:42.725 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Mm-hmm.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And now, are you using your
own methodology in doing this?

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.533 align:middle line:84%
Or are you using a combination
of the Balinese methods?

00:39:49.533 --> 00:39:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Oh no, we're trained
within an inch of our life

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.050 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital in
Indonesia how to do

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.540 align:middle line:84%
exactly this particular chant
and these exact particular

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.340 align:middle line:90%
movements.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.882 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
follow the protocols

00:39:59.882 --> 00:40:00.993 align:middle line:90%
because they're proven?

00:40:00.993 --> 00:40:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Yes, proven
for thousands of years.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's Sanskrit in that
I have to place it in you.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.420 align:middle line:84%
How many people have been
doing Kundalini yoga forever,

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:84%
but they can't get fire,
they can't create heat?

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:14.392 align:middle line:84%
Once it's placed in you,
and you have that heat,

00:40:14.392 --> 00:40:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and you know how to
carry it up the spine

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.140 align:middle line:90%
and bring it through you.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.380 align:middle line:90%
I always say, we are the cord.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.580 align:middle line:90%
The ailing person is the iPhone.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And the energy that we've
been entering to tap into

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:90%
is the outlet in the wall.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:90%
We are the cord.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I'm doing to you.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You have to tell
me when I touch you

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.660 align:middle line:84%
if you feel the pain in
you or the discourse.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I then do the healing,
connected to the outlet.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And then I touch you again.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And if the pain is gone
and the ailment is gone,

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.530 align:middle line:90%
we know it worked.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.420 align:middle line:90%
But I don't get to say it works.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.940 align:middle line:90%
I get to just be the cord.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:10%
OK, so, now, some of
the conditions that you

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.840 align:middle line:10%
witnessed when you were
there or were part of.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.640 align:middle line:84%
One of them had to do
with the person that

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.580 align:middle line:84%
was suffering from a
possession, is that correct?

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: OK, no.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but these were
Balinese people.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So I got there, and I said, I'd
like to learn how to do this.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher,
through the translator,

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
told us that it would take
a minimum of four years.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:22.490 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did this have to do
with possession, or other--

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: No, no,
no, this is just the--

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you how I got there.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: So in three days
time, I met with this man,

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.580 align:middle line:84%
the head of the
hospital, Ratu Nabe.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, please
teach me how to do this.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.042 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I'd
be able to do it.

00:41:38.042 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not Balinese.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted my clients to
see beyond the veil of what

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.400 align:middle line:90%
they were doing.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.450 align:middle line:90%
So I said, show me.

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And in a three-day period,
he showed me some things.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
and through the translator,

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.100 align:middle line:84%
he put his hand out and
he said, touch my finger.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.933 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
he was talking about.

00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I touched his finger, and he
goes, we'll try next year.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.165 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
Wayan, the translator.

00:42:03.165 --> 00:42:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what does
he want me to do?

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, I don't understand.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And Wayan said, next year.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said, knock it off.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.393 align:middle line:90%
Translate.

00:42:11.393 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he wanted
you to touch his finger

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:15.360 align:middle line:84%
to see if he could feel
that you had the energy.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.943 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you
didn't tell me that.

00:42:16.943 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And I demanded, which
you shouldn't do,

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.440 align:middle line:90%
that he give me a second chance.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.390 align:middle line:90%
And I locked--

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.557 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you pumped up.

00:42:24.557 --> 00:42:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --and I
mustered, and I touched him,

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and there it was.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:33.320 align:middle line:84%
He then said the next day, we
have a social once a month,

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.173 align:middle line:90%
and it's tomorrow.

00:42:35.173 --> 00:42:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
take you with me,

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.257 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to ask
you to heal people.

00:42:38.257 --> 00:42:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at him
like he was insane,

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.882 align:middle line:84%
and I said, what are
you talking about?

00:42:42.882 --> 00:42:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I had been told it
takes four years to learn.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I had been told all
of these things.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And here, now, he said, I
have ordained you as a healer,

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.040 align:middle line:90%
and you're going with me.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.965 align:middle line:90%
And we must have had 40 or--

00:42:53.965 --> 00:42:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
a clip of that.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.390 align:middle line:90%
We're going to show the clip.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Great.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Should we do it now?

that, every time something

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:51.700 align:middle line:84%
comes through, that the
brain has a secretion.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And it downloads according
to a thought-mind-body

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.610 align:middle line:84%
that we had that
we send that down.

cell phones pick it up.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.110 align:middle line:84%

this to your arm,

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:01.435 align:middle line:90%
or I'm sending this to blood.

00:48:01.435 --> 00:48:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And it cleans and
moves through our body,

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:90%
which is how the body listens.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.060 align:middle line:90%
We're like a Trojan horse.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.770 align:middle line:84%

all these trillions of
little things going on.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:14.920 align:middle line:84%

through, the body, the DNA,

So the master cell
phone connector goes, I

00:48:23.388 --> 00:48:24.680 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to do with you.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.070 align:middle line:84%

down the river of the body.

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.410 align:middle line:84%

with the greatest weakness.

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:34.250 align:middle line:84%

cell, and it just sits there,

and it's nothing.

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And over time, every time I
see that person I have anger,

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.650 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the discourse is
in me, that secretion happens,

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:46.180 align:middle line:84%
sends down that white blood cell
that now, as it comes through,

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:49.450 align:middle line:84%
the master cell
calls and goes, oh, I

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.040 align:middle line:90%
know where your brother is.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Go there.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And it starts sending
it to the weakness.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's an ear infection,
or in the heart, or the blood,

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.920 align:middle line:90%
or the limbs.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And it sends it there.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And over 20 or 30 years,
it's like a festering disease

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.530 align:middle line:84%
that happens inside until we,
in our modern day medicine,

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.070 align:middle line:90%
can pick it up.

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:12.580 align:middle line:84%

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.070 align:middle line:84%
I had a gentleman
that came to me

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:31.270 align:middle line:84%
a couple of weeks ago who hadn't
been able to smell or taste

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:32.250 align:middle line:90%
in 10 years.

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's two of
your five senses.

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:37.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a very big loss
to a physical body.

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and
to your engagement with this

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.200 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I did one
five-minute healing on him,

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and he can smell and
taste everything.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.160 align:middle line:90%
It took five minutes.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But we just give up because
we don't have another place

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:52.170 align:middle line:90%
to look.

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: So I think
disease in the body, when

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:59.770 align:middle line:84%
you can understand how it
got there, why it's there,

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and how to become
more aware than it is,

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:09.100 align:middle line:84%
then it's not a
trance we go into.

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
healing that occurs.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the more
classic indigenous version

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.740 align:middle line:84%
of it, where they feel
that it's actually

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.615 align:middle line:84%
the influence of another entity,
perhaps in another realm?

00:51:20.615 --> 00:51:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I am doing my best
not to go there during this

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:24.800 align:middle line:84%
show, but you keep
going there, so I will--

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
it's part of our reality.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: It is,
but it scares people.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.215 align:middle line:90%
And my work is already--

00:51:30.215 --> 00:51:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're OK here.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:31.560 align:middle line:90%
You're safe.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.190 align:middle line:84%
This audience is
very open-minded.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: OK.

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:35.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
don't have to be

00:51:35.105 --> 00:51:37.450 align:middle line:84%
nervous about talking about
it and frightening people.

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:39.470 align:middle line:90%
We go in far scarier places, OK?

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: OK.

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:41.388 align:middle line:90%
I will trust you.

00:51:41.388 --> 00:51:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you.

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:43.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:44.283 align:middle line:90%
Please share.

00:51:44.283 --> 00:51:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Like I
said, Bali to me

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.560 align:middle line:84%
is 60 years old where
we're three years old.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.860 align:middle line:84%
That the karma in
these countries is--

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:59.350 align:middle line:84%
they've gone from so much war
and disease and death and feast

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:00.250 align:middle line:90%
and famine.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And they have seen--

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Collective trauma.

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --over
such a long period

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:10.120 align:middle line:84%
of time that they know that the
five sensory intellect doesn't

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.510 align:middle line:90%
work anymore.

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:12.920 align:middle line:90%
It's karmic.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So dharma is where
you get the way it is.

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:19.450 align:middle line:90%
There is no thought it just is.

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Karma is when you don't get the
way it is, so the mind sets off

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.840 align:middle line:84%
an offshoot in order to present
something in the world in front

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.630 align:middle line:84%
of you so that you can see
your internal self externally

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:34.163 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a game to play
to learn your internal self.

00:52:34.163 --> 00:52:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as the
boy in the bubble--

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.900 align:middle line:90%
remember the boy in the bubble?

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Like a baby in amniotic
fluid, without being attached

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:47.320 align:middle line:84%
to the mother, and without
that urination of its food

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that it's getting through
the umbilical cord.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.950 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't build
the amniotic fluid

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:53.500 align:middle line:90%
that its lungs develop in.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.793 align:middle line:84%
And that fluid, the moment
we're born, it breaks,

00:52:56.793 --> 00:52:58.960 align:middle line:84%
we cut the cord, and we
come into the outside world.

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.400 align:middle line:84%
The moment we begin to think, we
start to build that fluid again

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:07.060 align:middle line:84%
like the boy in the bubble
where every thought that we have

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.610 align:middle line:84%
is within the confines
of our own self

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.110 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking through.

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:14.270 align:middle line:84%
That when I see you,
I see from me to you,

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:15.520 align:middle line:90%
not a clarity of what you are.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.812 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's your filter.

00:53:16.812 --> 00:53:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And the
karma that I am

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.220 align:middle line:84%
is the amniotic fluid
that fills in my bubble

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.205 align:middle line:84%
of every out-of-order
thought I've ever had.

00:53:23.205 --> 00:53:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Which we don't have enough
time on this show, but--

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:26.142 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we won't
go into it in depth.

00:53:26.142 --> 00:53:26.310 align:middle line:90%
But we hear--

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --talk about
how those thoughts come in.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So that when I look through
my bubble, what I see

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:35.680 align:middle line:84%
is what I know that
I then opinionate

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.020 align:middle line:90%
as, it belongs to you.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.000 align:middle line:84%
When it's dharmic,
there's clarity.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.890 align:middle line:90%
There's no amniotic fluid.

00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:42.820 align:middle line:90%
It's clear.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:46.360 align:middle line:90%
I can see through God.

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I can see totality.

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't see through me.

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:51.580 align:middle line:84%
When it's karmic,
it's from my history

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:55.810 align:middle line:84%
through me to you that
gives me the game to play.

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:58.990 align:middle line:84%
In Bali, they are
so far in advance

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of what we are afraid of here
that they have learned to throw

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:04.270 align:middle line:90%
black magic at each other.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was the word
that I wasn't going to bring in,

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.280 align:middle line:90%
but I know is true.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: It is true.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And I want nothing
to do with it,

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's not in the
realm I play it.

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But I know black
magic is disease.

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I know that anywhere
that it's been thrown

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.010 align:middle line:90%
on us that, tag, you're it.

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:22.990 align:middle line:90%
You caught that hot potato.

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And now it's your
karmic world duty

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:29.830 align:middle line:84%
to find your own
beyond where I am.

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And most people die
with the disease.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.910 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot
of us that actually

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:37.120 align:middle line:84%
go beyond it, that learn
about it, learn through it,

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and become a part
of something greater

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:42.700 align:middle line:84%
than our own individuality
as a rite of passage

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.800 align:middle line:90%
that takes us into beyond that.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.640 align:middle line:84%
These people have
developed, through days

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and weeks and months and years
and decades and millennia--

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:54.590 align:middle line:84%
they literally live in a
different kind of universe

00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:55.390 align:middle line:90%
than we live in.

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
wanted to get to here.

00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:59.390 align:middle line:90%
It is quite different.

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that
we're not surrounded

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:05.200 align:middle line:90%
with many species of life.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.150 align:middle line:10%
Beings, even, that
we can't see, that

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:10.090 align:middle line:10%
are just slightly phased
off in their own realities,

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:11.350 align:middle line:10%
in their own worlds.

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these
worlds interface,

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it can cause
a disturbance in a person

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:18.650 align:middle line:84%
by way of association
in that way.

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:21.220 align:middle line:10%
And so, in your
work, you really try

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:25.450 align:middle line:10%
to take it and look at the
effects that are knocked on

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.730 align:middle line:10%
from however we
come out of balance

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.220 align:middle line:10%
and taken into disease, into
our psychospiritual, physical

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:32.020 align:middle line:10%
world.

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Absolutely, but
I can teach people the math

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:36.250 align:middle line:90%
so they understand it.

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:37.650 align:middle line:90%
That takes the fear away.

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So when you see the shadow,
and you look, and it's gone,

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and your mind goes, oh, I
thought I saw something.

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:45.520 align:middle line:84%
What you don't understand
is, you did see a shadow,

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.700 align:middle line:84%
but your two eyes that are
connected to your intellect

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.825 align:middle line:84%
are not advanced enough to
actually see the shadow.

00:55:50.825 --> 00:55:51.625 align:middle line:90%
So

00:55:51.625 --> 00:55:54.320 align:middle line:84%
When you learn to commune with
the shadow, so your third eye,

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.490 align:middle line:84%
yourself beyond before your
intellectual ideas of I'm

00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:59.950 align:middle line:84%
a woman, I'm this
age, I am good or bad,

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:02.650 align:middle line:84%
that that third eye
that can actually

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:06.790 align:middle line:84%
commune with the shadow
world can learn to step in.

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you step in, it always
can only be God holding you.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it has
to be without fear.

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: It has to be without
fear, because if you step in

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.000 align:middle line:84%
with fear, what are you
magnetically attracting?

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and that's the
only reason I brought it up.

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:18.850 align:middle line:90%
You just said, so great.

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And because we only
have a few minutes left,

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.050 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to talk about--

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:26.860 align:middle line:84%
you have kind of a
saying that I think

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.710 align:middle line:84%
is very practical
and very important.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.138 align:middle line:84%
And that is that every
home should have a healer.

00:56:32.138 --> 00:56:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, every
home has a computer.

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Every home deserves a healer.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I agree, and this can
be taught to children with such

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.230 align:middle line:10%
ease because they don't have the
filters to believe they can't.

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.440 align:middle line:90%
So talk about how you do this.

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: So many of
my clients' children--

00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I've also been a parenting
teacher for the last 30 years.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:51.533 align:middle line:84%
So many of my clients
that have children

00:56:51.533 --> 00:56:52.950 align:middle line:84%
are teaching it
to their children.

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:54.150 align:middle line:90%
And they all come to me.

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I work with a lot
of children with cancer.

00:56:57.350 --> 00:56:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So when they come
in, they're adorable.

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.110 align:middle line:90%
When I work on them, they cry.

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:03.603 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
pleasant, but I know

00:57:03.603 --> 00:57:04.770 align:middle line:90%
that I'm there to help them.

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not harming them.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.670 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they're done,
they want to be in my arms

00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:10.050 align:middle line:90%
and they love me again.

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
connection that happens

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.230 align:middle line:90%
that's non-intellectual.

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And like animals,
children feel talked at.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:18.070 align:middle line:84%
We look at them like
they're over there.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't commune with them.

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you are connected
to them, they feel it.

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:23.640 align:middle line:90%
They come sit on your lap.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.710 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh,
you can see me.

00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:26.560 align:middle line:90%
People can't see me.

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.185 align:middle line:84%
They talk at me and
tell me what to do,

00:57:28.185 --> 00:57:31.470 align:middle line:84%
but they're not interconnected,
interrelated with me.

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So as we teach these
children-- and it's so cute

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:36.540 align:middle line:84%
because I'll have
my healers there.

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And we'll all be firing up,
is what I call it, together.

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:41.100 align:middle line:90%
And we'll be doing this.

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And the little kids can say
it, and they can repeat it.

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we practice
the energy in our hands,

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.420 align:middle line:90%
they're practicing the energy.

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And they come over,
because you can

00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:52.350 align:middle line:84%
feel the energy in my hands,
and they'll stick their hand in,

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.250 align:middle line:90%
and they can feel it.

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you see them sit
down, and they practice it.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they go to
school, and they play it

00:57:58.530 --> 00:57:59.340 align:middle line:90%
with their friends.

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And their friends
are all practicing it

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:02.577 align:middle line:90%
because no one's told them--

00:58:02.577 --> 00:58:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love this, yeah.

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: --they can't.

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:08.100 align:middle line:84%
In April, I'm going to
have my first child.

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm already very clear
that this grandchild will never

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:13.890 align:middle line:84%
have teething problems
or diaper rash,

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:18.060 align:middle line:84%
because we'll just
heal him, little Hank.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And as he grows up, he'll
see what grandma is doing,

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.110 align:middle line:90%
and he'll just mimic it.

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if grandma is
doing it, it must be good.

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:26.500 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful
experience with my son

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:31.740 align:middle line:84%
at one point where I was
doing these things on him,

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.120 align:middle line:90%
with him, when he was younger.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.820 align:middle line:84%
He had migraines, and I would
work with energy with him.

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And then he was just very
sensitive, and he learned that.

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I needed it many
years later, he was there,

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:44.160 align:middle line:90%
and he just knew what to do.

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the most amazing kind of
active giving, as human beings,

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.920 align:middle line:84%
we can give to each
other is this ability

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to care for one another
and ultimately even assist

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.060 align:middle line:90%
in each other's healing.

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.550 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERS: I'm so proud to
hear you tell that story.

00:58:56.550 --> 00:59:00.210 align:middle line:10%
That's really, really
beautiful and important.

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:02.530 align:middle line:84%
We pay attention to
what is, not what isn't.

00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, exactly.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, my dear, thank you.

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:08.280 align:middle line:84%
What wonderful
abilities you have.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.400 align:middle line:10%
And you're now with people--

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.600 align:middle line:10%
you're teaching regularly?

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have ongoing
classes, so people can come in?

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:16.188 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: We have
ongoing classes,

00:59:16.188 --> 00:59:18.300 align:middle line:84%
but if they are interested
in becoming a healer,

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:20.670 align:middle line:90%
our next round is in January.

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And then in April, we go
to Bali to be initiated.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right, OK.

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:27.193 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm sure you'll
be packed, as always.

00:59:27.193 --> 00:59:28.860 align:middle line:10%
And thank you for
bringing yourself here

00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:30.630 align:middle line:10%
and for sharing your
experience with us,

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:32.380 align:middle line:10%
because I think it's
important that we all

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:34.350 align:middle line:10%
understand this is within us.

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It is within our capabilities.

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:37.680 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
learn how to tap it.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And you have one of the
means of tapping it.

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:40.170 align:middle line:90%
And teaching it.

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Thank
you for having me.

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're most welcome.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Candace.

00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:47.010 align:middle line:10%
