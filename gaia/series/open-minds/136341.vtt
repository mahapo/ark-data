00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We promised we

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:84%
were going to come
back a year ago

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and do the next interview
in this incredible library

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.422 align:middle line:90%
of yours, and we made it.

00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:35.921 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA HAND CLOW:
We are, Regina.

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:36.721 align:middle line:90%
And it's great.

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:37.887 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you know what?

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:10%
We had to do this because
it's a follow-up conversation.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle line:10%
Last time we spoke
about the "Alchemy

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:10%
of Nine Dimensions,"
which has been wildly

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:10%
popular with our viewers.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
we almost skipped

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:90%
over the fourth dimension.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
and why that happened.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:84%
After the show we
said, what happened

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.430 align:middle line:90%
to the fourth dimension?

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the hardest
one to figure out.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the
hardest one to figure out.

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:84%
It's one directly related
to the Annunaki, right?

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we decided we got to come
back and do this thing right.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be our
conversation a little later on.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But first, we're going to talk
about a time-free transparent

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And just saying
those words, I think,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.245 align:middle line:84%
makes people feel
uplifted, right?

00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I
think that's true.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.861 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you're
saying it really

00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:10%
has to do with the
astrology of the times

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.857 align:middle line:10%
and what it's leading
us to, profoundly

00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:10%
altering the Earth and
our experience on it.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.821 align:middle line:10%
So let's set it up
by way of astrology,

00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:10%
and then we'll start going
into the particulars.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: OK.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, we have really
come to a point where

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:10%
we're poised at a
level of huge change

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:10%
because we went through
the end of the two dates

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:10%
for the Mayan calendar,
2011 and 2012.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:10%
And then we also, right
after we ended the calendars,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:10%
then we had seven major squares
between Uranus and Pluto.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really big
deal because Uranus and Pluto

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
were conjunct in the 1960s,
when all of the idealism

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and all of the new
ideas that all of us

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:84%
had been pursuing for so many
years, that's when it started.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And so when it comes
to the square position,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
that's when it comes
to a crisis point.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we are in a huge
crisis right now regarding

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
the issues of idealism and
potential healthy society

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.100 align:middle line:90%
and ecology, et cetera.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:90%
And so here we are.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:84%
We're really poised
at a difficult point.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And at this point in time,
what tends to happen is chaos

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:90%
tends to overwhelm us.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And then add to that the entry
into the Age of Aquarius.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just astrology,
although, of course,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.760 align:middle line:84%
the great ages are
also astrology.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But we are really
at this point really

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
moving into Aquarius
really fast now, which

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
means that all of the
issues that we developed

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
during the Age of Pisces
are disintegrating

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and falling apart,
especially the patriarchy.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's what I was

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.071 align:middle line:84%
going to ask you about next,
and let's talk about that.

00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:52.610 align:middle line:10%
I mean, here we're sitting on
the precipice of an election

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:10%
that I don't think
anybody in the US

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:10%
is particularly proud of.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It's coming down to the
lesser-of-evil type of choices

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.535 align:middle line:90%
again, which is--

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:03.844 align:middle line:84%
that phenomena has been
increasing for a while.

00:03:03.844 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Although I think there
was a lot of hope

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
around the 2008 election
initially with Obama--

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:90%
hope, change, and all.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:90%
But It didn't happen.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And so what does that
set us up for now?

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:84%
We have a political scene
with Trump and Clinton, two

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.175 align:middle line:90%
unpopular characters overall.

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
reasons I'm really

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
interested in
time-free transparency

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:84%
is the person who
created it, invented it,

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:84%
is a philosopher
named Jean Gebser.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And so he has actually come
up with a philosophy of hope

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
that actually does explain
what's going on right now.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And so regarding
the US election,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I can assure you that it's
very helpful if you have

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:90%
a long perspective right now.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Because when we
come to this crisis point that

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:90%
we're at at this point--

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're really
in it heavily now,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
be very intense

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:90%
for probably 5, 10 years.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
at that point is

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
we literally go through a
mutation of our species,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
which is a really
hard thing to imagine.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things that's
exciting about Jean Gebser

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
is that he has described some
previous mutational processes.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And I find that when
I look at the changes

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:84%
in previous periods, it gives
me a lot more perspective

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.168 align:middle line:90%
on what's going on now.

00:04:16.168 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Do you care
to fill us in on some

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:10%
of his glimpses of the past
and what this particular period

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:10%
of time fomented?

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, in his work--

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll probably discuss
the changes that he describes.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But in my own work,
I really work heavily

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:84%
with the changes
of the great ages.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And so in my current work,
which happens to be fiction,

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm really working on the
end of the Age of Pisces

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and the beginning of
the Age of Aquarius.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:84%
But the question is how
you understand that.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've found
personally that if we

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:84%
look at the ending of
the age before Pisces,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:90%
which is the Age of Aries--

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:90%
and this is like 100 BC.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And so there's all
these books behind us

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that all go back to right
around 100 BC to like 200 AD.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.657 align:middle line:84%
Because if we understand how
the previous age changed,

00:05:01.657 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:84%
then it's a little bit easier
to have a perspective now.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, set
us up with that.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.720 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:10%
And what happened
with that is we

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:10%
know you could call it the
Messianic Age, in a sense.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But the Age of
Aries was actually

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
about the development
of warfare,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
because Aries is a very
aggressive astrological sign

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:90%
because it's ruled by Mars.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And so as we moved into the
Age of Pisces, unfortunately

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the war and
aggression was not

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
transformed and transmuted
as it should have been.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And so what we did is we
went into the Age of Pisces

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.205 align:middle line:84%
with all the warfare, and we
transformed it into warfare

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:37.005 align:middle line:90%
for God.

00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, war
in the name of God.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
We've had 2,000 years now
of war in the name of God.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that's
really characteristic of these

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
mutational points-- this is
something that could really

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:90%
help people, I think--

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
is that when you get to this
mutational point, the way

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
it feels is what's
really important.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And what finally happens is you
just can't stand it anymore.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really seeing this
with the wars for gods.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing Islamic
people, Christian people,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Jewish people are really
just disgusted because it's

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:90%
absolutely not worth it.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And so this particular
age change into Aquarius

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
is a rather difficult
one because things

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:90%
aborted 2,000 years ago.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
don't think that anyone

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
would argue with you that the
feeling of just being fed up

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:84%
seems to be
multi-generational now.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:10%
I hear my father, who is
classically quite conservative,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:10%
talking about the
times, and he can't

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:10%
believe in his own
old-fashioned values anymore.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing
to represent that.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you go through
to the Millennials

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
who seem totally at a loss
as to what to do next.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: I agree.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And so then you
could look at Trump

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.180 align:middle line:84%
from a positive point
of view in this way.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling he's
a steaming tea kettle.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I think he's blowing off steam
for people who are frustrated,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
who don't have a
voice and all that.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.917 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
you have to start

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
to have some understanding
about what's happening.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
tremendous amount of energy,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:84%
emotional energy and
intellectual energy,

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.665 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be
released at this time

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
living according

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
to very, very false
paradigms, and we just

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.120 align:middle line:90%
can't stand it anymore.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we can't.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So what do you see this as--
just going off topic just a tad

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle line:90%
bit--

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
how do you see this expressing
itself in the Millennials

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
compared to the generation
of the '60s that

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:90%
were presented with this?

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I think the
Millennials, first of all,

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:84%
are in the process of decoding
a lot of the false story.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And I've
enjoyed doing that with them,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.460 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a teacher
for a lot of them.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And then secondly,
I think they're

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.566 align:middle line:84%
doing a very, very good
job of ignoring the BS.

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:40.366 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:41.824 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Because,
for instance,

00:07:41.824 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
people our age,
as hard as we try,

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
the minute you put in one of
those mind-control programs,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:84%
we have a tendency
just to listen to it.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
These kids aren't
listening to it at all.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And then furthermore,
probably more significantly,

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is they are showing more signs
of the mutational stages that

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
were described by
Jean Gebser, and this

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
is the issue of the
time-free transparent world.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the reasons
I moved into this concept

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.730 align:middle line:84%
of time-free
transparency is because--

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:84%
back to "Alchemy
of Nine Dimensions"

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and our other interviews
and one coming up--

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I've struggled to-- even though
I understand this whole system

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
intellectually, I've
struggled to figure out,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:90%
how do I feel it?

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:90%
How can I intuit it?

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:90%
How do I know it?

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I found with
Jean Gebser's work

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.585 align:middle line:84%
that-- now, he wrote
way back in the 1950s.

00:08:32.585 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was the
"Ever-Present Origin"?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
"Ever-Present Origin" was
published in 1953 in English.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And so what's amazing about
him is that he has really

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:90%
come up with a description.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.299 align:middle line:84%
I think the alchemy description
is a fantastic description.

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
give us his-- yeah,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
his description or definition
of what a time-free transparent

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.410 align:middle line:90%
world is?

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.118 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well,
and one of the reasons

00:08:54.118 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I really went for his
work is that I had already

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
done all of the research
that he had done.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I hadn't
connected with him.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, first of all, I
did 100 sessions under hypnosis

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:90%
into my past lives.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
doing those sessions,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.012 align:middle line:84%
I time traveled over 100,000
years of human consciousness.

00:09:15.012 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's in the
"Mind Chronicles"

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:90%
trilogy, that story.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
100,000 years is the time

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.360 align:middle line:90%
phase of the Paleolithic world.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Paleolithic world
was an incredible time

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
for human consciousness because
that's when we became artistic,

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's when we started to
express ourselves with symbols.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But the reason it was
such a fantastic time

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
in our historical
experience was because we

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
were fused with nature.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:84%
If we go back into
the Paleolithic mind,

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:84%
we were not separate
from nature.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:84%
We didn't think of ourselves
as an individual human

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.190 align:middle line:90%
in relationship to nature.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to
contemplate that very deeply,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:84%
it gives you a tremendous
sense of fulfillment

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and a tremendous
sense of security.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So back to the
Millennials, I think

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
that's why they're
tattooing themselves.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:90%
They're using nose rings.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:84%
They're going back
into some of the ways

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:84%
that people used
to mark themselves

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.535 align:middle line:90%
50,000 to 100,000 years ago.

00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I was reading
something about that,

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.260 align:middle line:10%
that certain of the
tattoos were actually

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:10%
in geometric
configurations that had

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.020 align:middle line:10%
to do, for example, with
healing technologies and such,

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:10%
which that part of the art may
be lost to today's Millennials,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:10%
but may be subconsciously
re-emerging, right?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Oh,
it is re-emerging.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And that's
what I'm saying, is

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
what I'm seeing, back
to the Millennials--

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.910 align:middle line:84%
because what's important to me
is I'm a mom and a grandmother

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and all that, and I care
about that generation.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And so the more
that they're going

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand
what's coming through them,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:84%
the easier it's
going to be for them.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you could say
that people of that age

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:84%
will be the ones who will
birth the new hologram.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.048 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: You and I
will probably just enjoy

00:10:56.048 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:10%
having things being a lot
freer and more artistic

00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:10%
than they have been.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.989 align:middle line:10%
But that generation
is going to live it.

00:11:01.989 --> 00:11:03.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It makes
sense, because we really

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:10%
left them no functional
institutions or structures

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:10%
to work with anyway.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to have to
recreate from the ground up.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.659 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
no paying jobs even--

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.958 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --waiting for them.

00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:10%
So it's really a
blessing, in one way,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.287 align:middle line:10%
to be so free of those
obligations to plug in.

00:11:18.287 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And then what I found with
Gebser's work, which gave me

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:84%
this big answer, was
then the next phase

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness, it
starts around 10,000 years ago

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:90%
with the Neolithic mind.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And so in my case,
I've also written

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
a book called
"Catastrophobia," which

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
is now retitled "Awakening
of the Planetary Mind."

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a book-- it was
published back in 2001--

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
which gave a
scientific explanation

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
of a series of
cataclysms that affected

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:84%
our planet from about
maybe 13,000 years ago

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:90%
until about 11,500 years ago.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And in science, this is called
the Younger Dryas period,

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
where we had tremendous changes
in temperature and water, sea

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:84%
levels, and all
that kind of stuff.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And then it culminated 11,500
years ago with some kind

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.190 align:middle line:84%
of huge cataclysm
that was caused

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:90%
by some sort of cosmic agency.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I happen to think it was
fragments of a supernova.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
it was a comet.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.728 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But the
most important thing

00:12:19.728 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
is we know that our species
went through mind-numbing,

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.985 align:middle line:84%
mind-boggling cataclysmic living
on this planet for around 1,500

00:12:28.985 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:90%
to 2,000 years.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So in my own work, what I
see has happened with that is

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:84%
we became, at that point, a
multi-traumatized species.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So Jean Gebser
doesn't get into this.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:90%
He just gets into the shift.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
What he found was in
the Neolithic mind,

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
what happened is we developed
magical consciousness.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is something,
again, the Millennials

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:84%
will really, like, resonate with
because magical consciousness

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
involves realizing that you're
separate from the universe.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And then that first stage
of separation of ourselves

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
from being just
immersed in the universe

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:90%
was to try to control it.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:90%
So we created spells.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.210 align:middle line:84%
We created all these magical
techniques and meditations

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and all that to control the
basically overwhelming nature

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:90%
of nature itself.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Because
nature is overwhelming.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd like to go back a
bit to when we were talking

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle line:84%
about the Paleolithic period,
because some of these values

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:84%
are also rising to
the surface again now.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about that.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
interesting to watch

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:84%
the rise in these ancient
values with Paleolithic diets,

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:84%
with people going back
to really attempting

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:90%
to be fused with nature.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Another thing about
the Paleolithic mind

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.900 align:middle line:84%
that's really interesting
to me is it was global.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:84%
We had global consciousness,
Regina, 100,000 years ago,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.827 align:middle line:90%
50,000 years ago.

00:13:56.827 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you say
global consciousness,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:84%
how do you mean that,
in what context?

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well,
it's something

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I've tuned in for
years and years,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.395 align:middle line:84%
and you go hang out at sacred
sites and stone circles

00:14:06.395 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and some of the remnants.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Now the stone circles
are actually Neolithic.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But what was happening
during the Neolithic period,

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:84%
like we do now, people were
still saving technologies

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:17.825 align:middle line:90%
from previous ages.

00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
We could see a
whole lot of stuff

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
was destroyed, 11,000,
12,000 years ago.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So we always have
that dichotomy point

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness, which is a
real thing to make the bridge.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing
is, if you go back

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:84%
into the Paleolithic mind and
Paleolithic consciousness,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the people who lived in that
world, which, after all, was

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:84%
us, that was just us before,
we knew our whole environment.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.080 align:middle line:84%
People understood the
river systems, the oceans.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.640 align:middle line:84%
They understood consciousness
at tremendous distances.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
They worked with
patterns in the sky,

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:84%
like lunar patterns
and stellar patterns,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:84%
in order to be connected
with each other.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And I honestly believe that we
once were globally connected.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.943 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this is coming
back because of computerization

00:15:05.943 --> 00:15:06.743 align:middle line:90%
and the web.

00:15:06.743 --> 00:15:08.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
think we're going back

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:09.861 align:middle line:90%
into being globally connected.

00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:11.651 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what it seems to me,

00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:84%
is this is just a midway
step to going back

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.920 align:middle line:84%
into connected
native consciousness.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.452 align:middle line:84%
And are you saying, much
as the Aboriginal people

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:22.535 align:middle line:84%
around the world have done
within their own tribes

00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and themselves over
distances, that all

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:84%
of these different
tribes, at one time,

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:84%
could connect with each other
in the same mental planes?

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.263 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for going to the
really old indigenous people,

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
like the San of South Africa
or the people of the Andaman

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Islands in Indonesia.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Because fortunately, as
we've been-- now see,

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:90%
where are we now?

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:84%
We've been waking up
intellectually, especially

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:90%
the last couple hundred years.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So as we've been waking
up intellectually,

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
we've also been studying all
the people on the planet.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, there
were enough original people

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
left on the planet so
that anthropologists

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
were really able to
study their consciousness

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:90%
and their ways of life.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you get back into
studying the really, really

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:84%
old indigenous
people on the planet,

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:84%
like Australia, what
you find is that a guy

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
on one side of Australia
knows exactly what's going on

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:84%
with the guy on the
other side of Australia

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:84%
because they were able to
read the signals of nature.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
All the signals that link us
from a global, cosmological

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:90%
perspective are there.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.374 align:middle line:84%
It's only a matter of
whether you read them or not.

00:16:29.374 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.980 align:middle line:10%
Because here you're
mentioning with the rise

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:10%
of intellectualism in the
last couple hundred years,

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:10%
but at the same time
we really knocked out

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:10%
the use of our perceptive
abilities almost simultaneous

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:10%
to that.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.863 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:16:45.863 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet, what I really like
about this idea is that if we

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
go back into the beginning
of 100,000 years ago, then up

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to 10,000 years where we
became magical, then around

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.630 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago, we developed
a mythical sense of ourselves.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
And once we had a mystical
sense of ourselves as a species,

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:84%
then what happened
was that we had

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:84%
a sense of storytelling and
time traveling through time.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at each
one of these stages,

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
even though it may look
like the Paleolithic one was

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:84%
the best, in fact,
each one of them

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is an advancement
in consciousness.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
that we're on the verge

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.069 align:middle line:84%
of, like, you could say, the
fourth or fifth mutation.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I didn't actually count them up.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But one of them is 100,000 years
ago, then 10,000 years ago,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.124 align:middle line:90%
then 5,000 years ago.

00:17:35.124 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Then during the
Renaissance, there

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
was a very significant
mutation, where

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:84%
we became very, very
developed intellectually

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:90%
and artistically.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And now we're right in the
middle of another mutation.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this
model is so exciting--

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
his book is called
"Ever-Present Origin"--

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:84%
he was working with the idea
that all of these things

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:84%
are inherent within us and
within the planet itself.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And that each stage of it
is going to come forward

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:90%
in its natural time.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we are right now.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:84%
But when it happens,
it's chaotic.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting to
hear that you would say,

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and he would say
in his philosophy,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.077 align:middle line:84%
that this is an
organic rolling out.

00:18:18.077 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because everything
feels so completely contrived

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and controlled and
manipulated at this time

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that an organic
roll out isn't what

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:84%
we're feeling in this time
of chaos, as you said.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:84%
You know what I'd like to
do is take the story back,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.820 align:middle line:84%
if you're going
back 100,000 years,

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and let's go back into
the Atlantean times.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.920 align:middle line:10%
Because people have different
perceptions about what

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:10%
society and civilization
was like at that time,

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:10%
and "Paleolithic"
wouldn't be the first word

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:10%
that would come up.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, if we go back in--

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.594 align:middle line:84%
in order to do this, we've got
to go before the cataclysm.

00:18:50.594 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Because the only way--

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, way back.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:84%
The only way we can get any
sense of what was going on

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.380 align:middle line:84%
is before the
cataclysm occurred.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the best culture that
we have right now-- now see,

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.480 align:middle line:84%
we're in the middle of
this amazing awakening.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Like right now, our
understanding of ancient people

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:84%
is now moving back
very successfully,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.950 align:middle line:84%
back before 12,000, 13,000
years ago, back 17,000,

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.630 align:middle line:90%
18,000 years ago.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And so if we go back into this
period from 20,000 years ago

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
to 11,500 years
ago, which is one

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
of the things I concentrated
on in "Catastrophobia,"

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
the culture that
really comes forth

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.279 align:middle line:84%
is called the
Aurignacian culture.

00:19:29.279 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Say that again.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Aurignacian.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.193 align:middle line:84%
And maybe explain
that for us as well.

00:19:33.193 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: A-U-R-I-G--

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Aurignacian culture, right.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And much more
information is really

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:84%
coming in about this
culture at this point.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
caught everybody's attention

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:84%
is that they have these
beautiful points that we

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.920 align:middle line:84%
call Clovis points, but they're
actually not this other.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But you know those
beautiful points that people

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:90%
made for hunting and all that?

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.038 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: The
Aurignacian people

00:19:54.038 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:90%
made them all out of gemstones.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And they had carnelian
points and beautiful--

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to think of some of
the other semiprecious stones--

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:84%
agates and all
this kind of stuff.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And you see their
technology and you go like,

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:90%
these people were--

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What time period
was this we're looking at?

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: The Aurignacian
culture is about 25,000 years

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:90%
ago till about 17--

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:84%
no, actually it goes up
to about 12,000 years ago.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Because we have this
site called Gobekli Tepe.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I was
going to mention that.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.668 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
we now have a site

00:20:24.668 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:90%
that goes back 12,000 years.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think, and Andrew Collins,
one of the other researchers,

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.104 align:middle line:84%
we think that the Aurignacian
culture built that probably.

00:20:33.104 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:84%
We think that's
the only culture--

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the remnant of it.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.615 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --on
the planet that

00:20:36.615 --> 00:20:38.120 align:middle line:90%
could have built that site.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you see the
pictures of Gobekli Tepe

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and you study the site,
it's a very advanced site.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
But the advancement
is completely

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.112 align:middle line:84%
different than our
technological advancement.

00:20:50.112 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what's
fascinating, too.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and also Andrew's
point of view on that.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we tend to think of
technological advancement

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.590 align:middle line:90%
more as silicon-based.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:10%
Something's going to
serve as a slave to us.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:84%
What was advancement
in these times?

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, if you go
back to the Atlantean issue,

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:84%
what most people
do is they project

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:84%
a modern technological
mind on it.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And so they see it as this
technological civilization

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
that blew up in some kind
of great big explosion.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you can take
away your modern mindset

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and if you could go back
into those times looking

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
at it from the perspective
of those times,

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
that's where you can really
see what was going on.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.929 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
did these regressions.

00:21:33.929 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've done regressions
back into that period, too.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to hear
what you were seeing.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And I may add a thing
or two, but not much.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So I did 100 regressions,
and 5 or 10 of them

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:84%
were back 50,000, 80,000,
100,000 years ago.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I also
do a technique now

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.171 align:middle line:84%
for recovering consciousness
called ecstatic trance,

00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So as far as the
regressions are concerned,

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I simply time travel
back through that period.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.390 align:middle line:10%
And I have a real solid sense of
what their technology was like,

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:10%
and it--

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.315 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Tell us about it.

00:22:05.315 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, it involves--

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, it involves
knowing the planet

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
as a system that has
ley lines and vortexes,

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and these are energy lines
running throughout the planet.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And at various
points on the planet,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.340 align:middle line:84%
people have created sacred
sites in the same place

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.880 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over again,
because at certain places

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
on the planet special
energy accumulates.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
ask yourself, well,

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.640 align:middle line:90%
what do you do with that energy?

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where alchemy
of nine dimensions comes in.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if we go back into
the Paleolithic consciousness

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the people
were nine dimensional.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's my own model,
which involves some very high

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:90%
spiritual states.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly maybe
than the high spiritual states

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:84%
is they were in touch with
the center of the earth.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
They were in touch with
the realm below us,

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:90%
which is the Telluric realm.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And because of that they were
able to utilize the energy

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:90%
of the planet itself.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.420 align:middle line:84%
This planet has tremendous
energy and consciousness.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to the
people of that time,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:84%
they were working with energy
I think much more profoundly

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.206 align:middle line:90%
than we are now.

00:23:12.206 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Much more profoundly.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.038 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe so.

00:23:14.038 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:10%
I know the times
that I dipped back

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:10%
into that time in past
life regressions years ago,

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:10%
there was an absence of
that noise of electricity

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:10%
as we know it.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It didn't
exist in that way.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.190 align:middle line:10%
Yet, the efficiency of being
able to light, right down

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:10%
to being able to light
dark side of the darker

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:10%
side of the mountain to grow
crops more efficiently, I mean,

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:10%
just abundant
produce, for example.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But none of that static
of an electrical field

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:90%
that we produce now.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.598 align:middle line:84%
And on that one you're
probably going back more

00:23:45.598 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:90%
into the Neolithic.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But the Paleolithic
people also did

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:84%
kind of more horticultural
farming and stuff like that.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But just imagine as we sit here
right now, what if we really

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.732 align:middle line:84%
understood the agenda
of this planet?

00:23:59.732 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Because clearly we
don't right now.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.731 align:middle line:84%
We're really far
off track right now.

00:24:02.731 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or if we do,
we're not [INAUDIBLE] now.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: We at a point
now, because of the overuse

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
of rational consciousness, where
we are basically destroying

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:90%
the systems of the planet.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet, what if we could tune
into the real message coming

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:90%
from the systems of the planet?

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
were able to do.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we've
been moving away from.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But instead of feeling
negative about it,

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
it's just that we're on
the verge of another leap.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
going right back

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
to Paleolithic consciousness,
but with all of the other forms

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.430 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness also existent.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So the magical consciousness
and the mythical consciousness,

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're not going to
let go of rationalization.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to let go of being

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
able to use these
wonderful brains in order

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:90%
to think and to create.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.709 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to move back
into resonance with the planet

00:24:55.709 --> 00:24:56.508 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:24:56.508 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:90%
And why are we going to do it?

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
As far as I can see
with human beings

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:84%
nobody does anything unless
they're forced to do it.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we are right now.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:90%
We're forced.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
even though we have

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:84%
a lot of idiotic leaders
creating more systems

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:84%
destroying the planet
the energy is rising

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:90%
to stop it and change it.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what you can really
see with the millennials.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: That's
what you can really see.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's take it back then
to the last time necessity

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.570 align:middle line:84%
was the mother of invention
and just total disorientation

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:90%
after the catastrophe.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of your colleagues,
I've heard their takes on it.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
They're now coming
out more publicly

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:84%
with the story of
11,500, 12,000 years ago

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and a catastrophe, a
global catastrophe.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Deluge, deluge comes up a lot.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
people, as you said,

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:84%
they were using myth,
magic, and so forth

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and spells, how we began
reorienting ourselves

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:90%
over that period of time.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well,
what happened was

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:84%
once the cataclysms occurred,
we got our heads knocked off.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:84%
We really were helpless
multi-traumatized species.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to 9000 BC.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And so at that
point, what happened

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all, as always
happens with human beings,

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:84%
some human beings were
in a stronger position

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.193 align:middle line:84%
because maybe they were
on the top of the mountain

00:26:18.193 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and they
weren't as badly destroyed.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And other people's cultures
were very severely damaged.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And so a pattern starts
at that point of leaders

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:90%
controlling followers.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And then that, of course,
goes through history

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and has gotten to
be more intense.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost out
of necessity people

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:90%
are truly flailing.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: It's important to
see that this was a necessity.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.323 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so
the first response

00:26:42.323 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
was the right response,
which was necessity.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened is human
beings being so profoundly

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:84%
creative, and you know we are
a really creative species.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're living with these
multi-dimensional frequency

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:90%
ranges.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And we are capable of just
incredible creativity.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:middle line:90%
So we developed magic.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:90%
And magic was fun.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And then gradually we
started understanding how we

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:90%
could control our reality more.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the mythic mind, of
course, is a sense of story

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.680 align:middle line:90%
and a sense of time.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But then what happens
finally is rationalism hits.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And it really starts
with the Greeks.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.460 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks were the
first great thinkers.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if you
go back to 500 BC,

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the development
of the Greek culture, what

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.010 align:middle line:84%
was happening for people is
people were basically nuts.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the really
good references

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
on this is a very
strange book called

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:84%
"The Breakdown of the Bicameral
Mind" by Julian Jaynes,

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.650 align:middle line:84%
which you may be
familiar with, were

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:84%
basically he just
describes human beings

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:84%
as being just battier beyond
belief and with Euripides

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and Sophocles and all the crazy
wonderful Greek creativity.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
is Plato comes along.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And we start getting
more logical.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.320 align:middle line:84%
We start realizing
that as fascinating

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:84%
as magical consciousness is, and
as mythical consciousness is,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:84%
we've got to find out more
about who are we really.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.049 align:middle line:90%
What are we really capable of?

00:28:11.049 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think most
importantly from the point

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:84%
of view of Plato, I think Plato
was the first modern thinker

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.930 align:middle line:84%
to bring up nine dimensions
of consciousness.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Because Plato was really
multi-dimensional.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And Plato realized
that we've got

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:84%
to use our
consciousness logically

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:32.270 align:middle line:84%
in order to live on this planet
with the mythical, magical,

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Paleolithic potential.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, Regina, where
you can really

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.690 align:middle line:84%
see how this is working
out is the problem

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're having now with
so many young people going

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:84%
crazy and creating violent
acts and having problems

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:90%
with drugs and all that.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Because this is why
it's so important

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.830 align:middle line:84%
to start to understand what's
attempting to emerge now.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
rationalism has shut down,

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
especially the millennials,
to such an extreme degree

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that they're just
totally reactionary.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: But they're right.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: They're right.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.939 align:middle line:84%
Because what's it going
to take to break this?

00:29:06.939 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the problem when
you get to this mutation

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:90%
stage, this change stage.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:84%
It's so difficult to
get people to throw out

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.550 align:middle line:90%
their old way of doing things.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Even if they know
absolutely what

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.260 align:middle line:84%
they're doing is destructive,
they still keep on going.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.660 align:middle line:84%
American politics right
now is the best example

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I could come up
with of that issue.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.490 align:middle line:84%
As you're talking, I'm thinking
that the mythical magical mind

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:35.020 align:middle line:84%
more closely emulated the direct
experience that people once

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.680 align:middle line:90%
had with the earth.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that
was the development

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.132 align:middle line:84%
as a substitute for that
direct experience of Earth.

00:29:43.132 --> 00:29:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And then also,
another interesting thing

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:84%
about the magical mind is-- in
relationship to Donald Trump,

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I find this really interesting--
is the magical mind

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.430 align:middle line:84%
was developing in the
middle of this period

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.740 align:middle line:84%
when we were so
super traumatized.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And so people were trying
to deal with problems

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:84%
by creating spells and
creating ideas in order to get

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:90%
people to just do things.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:90%
And Trump is a magician.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.266 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I see
what you're saying.

00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And the reason that
this concept is so important

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.195 align:middle line:84%
is that people, all those
people who are following Trump

00:30:13.195 --> 00:30:15.910 align:middle line:84%
right now, need to take
a serious look at what

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:90%
they're actually following.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.630 align:middle line:84%
No, listen, it's not
just Trump followers.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:84%
It's all of us have to look at
everything that we're actually

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:90%
following right now.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's an
especially good example.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Because, see, these
mentalities still exist.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:84%
They don't go away when it
changes to the next stage.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.265 align:middle line:84%
They change, but
they're still there.

00:30:37.265 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And the thing is
you were talking about control

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.840 align:middle line:10%
a moment ago once
rationalism set in,

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:10%
but that lays open the
opportunity for the mind

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:10%
to be almost completely co-opted
once you're disconnected

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:10%
from any natural systems.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
you were just talking about.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well,
this is what's

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.875 align:middle line:84%
so hard to express because
what's always hard to express

00:30:56.875 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:90%
is what you're changing into.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:84%
What are we really going to
be during the Age of Aquarius?

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course, is also the
next stage of this mutation.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And it has something to do with
really being in the present.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So more and more people
are finding the way

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.540 align:middle line:90%
to move into the present.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
tricky for people.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
The more logical a person
is, the harder it is.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So with
each type of person

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard to move
into the present time.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But at this point,
what's going to create

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:84%
the next shift and the next
change is being in the present.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We've worked all of
these thousands of years

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:39.190 align:middle line:84%
now on time, like
magical consciousness

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and mystical consciousness,
the Mayan calendar,

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:84%
all these different issues
of time acceleration,

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.610 align:middle line:90%
which I've written a lot about.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's all aimed at
moving into the present.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
where we are right now.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And if we just keep
on pressing into that,

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.080 align:middle line:90%
then we're going to get there.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.831 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say, the
more we move into it,

00:32:01.831 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:90%
the more chaotic things.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
going to say yes.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: They are.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:90%
And they will.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.290 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that old
realities can change

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.149 align:middle line:90%
and transform without chaos.

00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's look
at some of the systems

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.273 align:middle line:90%
that are being challenged.

00:32:13.273 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how did
organized religion

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:84%
factor into all of
these systems of control

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:84%
after the disorientation
and the catastrophe?

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.115 align:middle line:84%
Organized religion at this point
is a really sick situation.

00:32:28.115 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we know you're
writing about that at length

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:90%
in your trilogy.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm working on in my
trilogy is organized religion.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And some of my
fans don't like it.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's time to wake
up at this point.

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all falling
into a kind of habit

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.740 align:middle line:84%
of just not thinking some
of these things through.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And at this point with the
new paradigm researchers,

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.210 align:middle line:84%
we know a whole
lot of new things,

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:84%
for instance, about
Jesus being married

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.490 align:middle line:84%
to Mary Magdalene and all that
stuff that we could go into.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But what's important
is to understand

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:84%
what organized religion did,
because it's really insidious.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:84%
What happened with
organized religions

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.770 align:middle line:84%
is that during this
period of recovering

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:10.990 align:middle line:84%
from being a
multi-traumatized species

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and starting to get ourselves
back together, what happened

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.560 align:middle line:84%
was some of the people who
had the power and the ability

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.727 align:middle line:84%
to function, because a lot
of people were just flat.

00:33:19.727 --> 00:33:20.526 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:20.526 --> 00:33:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So the people who
had the power and the ability

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.110 align:middle line:84%
to function pretty soon they
discovered that if you just

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.600 align:middle line:84%
get people to believe in
something, like some god

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, then they'll
behave themselves.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can get them all to work
for you, or go to the church

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that you build to
make money off of,

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.700 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to create.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And so organized
religion came for us,

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:84%
as far as I'm concerned,
as a very insidious element

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:84%
in the working
out of the leaders

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:49.579 align:middle line:90%
and the people in control.

00:33:49.579 --> 00:33:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Because there's always
going to be leaders.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's always going
to be people in control.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But I don't see why god has to
be used as a device by them.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm very spiritual, and
I'm actually very religious.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
But what I believe in
and what I'm in contact

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.100 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have anything to
do with organized religion.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Because organized
religion is a program

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that's set up to control
me and everybody else.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.377 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to be controlled.

00:34:13.377 --> 00:34:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well let's talk
about that, the age of Pisces.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:16.820 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned it earlier.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.790 align:middle line:10%
We came out of the love of
war in Aries and a love of war

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.900 align:middle line:10%
in the name of god
in the age of Pisces.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Was there a more holistic
possibility of what

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.700 align:middle line:90%
that age could have looked like?

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: There was.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.990 align:middle line:90%
There was.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:84%
And I look at it in terms of
what Jesus came to the planet

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:90%
to create.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And first of all,
when an age starts,

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.760 align:middle line:84%
it usually doesn't culminate
until the end of the age.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually
think we're at a point

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.310 align:middle line:84%
now of really understanding
who this person was.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And the information
that's coming in

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.179 align:middle line:90%
is just mind boggling.

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:55.460 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
archaeologists have

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:84%
found the tomb in Jerusalem
that Jesus and his family

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.002 align:middle line:90%
were buried in.

00:35:00.002 --> 00:35:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That has a
lot of implications.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So the
Resurrection wasn't even true.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No Resurrection.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So you
don't have to believe

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.470 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was some guy who
had to fly up in the sky.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.728 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Jesus
can be a guy who

00:35:09.728 --> 00:35:11.630 align:middle line:84%
was a great father
or a great husband,

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.030 align:middle line:90%
a great teacher, a great person.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But he made a tremendous
impact on the age of Pisces

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:84%
because he came in to bring
in the Piscean age, which

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.620 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be an age of
learning how to live with love

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and compassion.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So all the way through
to Piscean age,

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.710 align:middle line:84%
we've been moving
further and further

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and getting closer
and closer to moving

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.650 align:middle line:90%
into compassion and love.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:43.280 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to use a
description for this mutation

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.320 align:middle line:84%
that we're running
into, I think what's

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:84%
finally going to happen is
people are just going to give

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.150 align:middle line:90%
into love and compassion.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think you can see that
with the refugee situation,

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's going on
with the refugee situation

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.360 align:middle line:84%
in Europe is absolutely
unparalleled.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It's on the scale of
things that happened

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.190 align:middle line:84%
during the cataclysm
12,000 years ago,

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.870 align:middle line:84%
on the scale of
what was going on

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:84%
during the first and
second World War.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And as we all know,
many, many people

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.010 align:middle line:84%
are doing everything they can
to not deal with the refugees.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole
lot of other people

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.250 align:middle line:84%
who are taking them in and
helping them and governments.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And how would you like
it if you looked in Syria

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.420 align:middle line:90%
and your town got bombed?

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.230 align:middle line:90%
These people have to leave.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:90%
And why are they leaving?

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.210 align:middle line:84%
They're leaving because of
what Western powers created

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.520 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: You know?

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We ignore
that conveniently.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.625 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But
what's happening

00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:35.870 align:middle line:84%
to it is that stage by
stage as the different parts

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:39.560 align:middle line:84%
of this unfold is
people are being forced

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.440 align:middle line:84%
to become loving and
compassionate because nothing

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.362 align:middle line:90%
else is going to work.

00:36:43.362 --> 00:36:44.945 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
going to have to do.

00:36:44.945 --> 00:36:48.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, you also
say that this change in ages

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:52.250 align:middle line:10%
and this particular
period of time

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:54.180 align:middle line:10%
brings a state of
absolute exhaustion.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.521 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
the implications of exhaustion

00:36:57.521 --> 00:36:58.955 align:middle line:90%
on every level.

00:36:58.955 --> 00:37:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Of course,
it brings exhaustion.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of the old
systems are getting tanked--

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:06.919 align:middle line:84%
patriarchal systems, economic
systems, political systems.

00:37:06.919 --> 00:37:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Religious structures.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.376 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so people
are exhausted because you

00:37:10.376 --> 00:37:11.589 align:middle line:90%
don't know where to turn.

00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:13.380 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what's
going to happen next.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.360 align:middle line:90%
And you really don't know.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:17.274 align:middle line:90%
And you don't know.

00:37:17.274 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But I know that we're
moving towards something

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.520 align:middle line:90%
very positive.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So if I can, Regina,
I'd like to go back

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to my struggle with
Jean Gebser, and what

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm attempting to
describe, is usually

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I can't figure
anything out unless I

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:90%
have a great image for it.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So the image that kept
coming forth for me

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.420 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
this 100,000

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
years of mutational
growth and development

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is the image of the great
tree of life in "Avatar."

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And that image in Avatar
moved me so strongly.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And so then I started
to realize, well, hey,

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:84%
the Ninth Pleiadian
nine- dimensional system

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is like the tree
of life with coming

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.830 align:middle line:84%
from the earth in
the Greek trunk

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and the fanning out of
the energy in the higher

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:10.404 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, if I hold this
sense of that great tree,

00:38:10.404 --> 00:38:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and even though they cut
it down in the movie,

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.420 align:middle line:84%
because that's exactly
how it would have gone.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.090 align:middle line:84%
A whole lot of great trees
of life have been cut down.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But they loved that
tree because it

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:84%
was an image of the
tree of life that's

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:90%
actually in the universe.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And did you know
that there's a shape

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.651 align:middle line:90%
of a tree of life in the--

00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I did not.

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:30.858 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: --cosmos itself?

00:38:30.858 --> 00:38:34.097 align:middle line:84%
Carl Calleman has
discovered this.

00:38:34.097 --> 00:38:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this a
recent discovery of his?

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Not too recent.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I forget the name of
that map, that big oval

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.715 align:middle line:84%
map that they have of
the whole universe.

00:38:41.715 --> 00:38:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But the tree of life
is actually a form

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that exists right within
the universe itself.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's deep, deep, deep
in our consciousness.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And what it does
for the universe,

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and what it does for us,
is it creates an ever

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.620 align:middle line:84%
ongoing tendency to
draw the energy of

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and to mutate and to develop
higher and higher levels,

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:90%
or I should say--

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the word higher
sometimes-- more complex levels

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:08.920 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things that confuses us

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:84%
about what's going on
and how to handle things

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:84%
is we think of space and
time as being limited.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But space and time are
actually not limited.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And frequencies are
not limited either.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So like right now we feel
like this planet is all

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.000 align:middle line:84%
filled up with garbage and it's
going to overwhelm everything.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.090 align:middle line:84%
But what's actually happening
is a mutation is going on.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I find that helps

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.330 align:middle line:84%
is that sense of that power
moving through the tree.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.090 align:middle line:90%
It just helps me.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:44.030 align:middle line:84%
When I see things in
really bad condition,

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.639 align:middle line:84%
I just keep on holding onto that
image of that powerful tree.

00:39:47.639 --> 00:39:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, going back
to what we just talked

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.754 align:middle line:84%
about a moment ago,
for those who are not

00:39:53.754 --> 00:39:55.170 align:middle line:84%
holding onto it
right now and just

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:58.100 align:middle line:84%
feeling that exhaustion
and hopelessness even,

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.540 align:middle line:84%
that that's actually
seems to me what's

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.930 align:middle line:84%
required to move into the
state of love and compassion

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:90%
that you're speaking about.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Where there's so little to
hang onto of the familiar

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.917 align:middle line:84%
that you just have
to give it up.

00:40:09.917 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, you're right.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And you immediately
flip my mind.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm, of course, part
Cherokee and indigenous,

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and I've had a lot of ceremonial
experience in my life.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And with the best
ceremonial work that we do,

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.200 align:middle line:84%
we go deliberately into
states of exhaustion.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.410 align:middle line:84%
We go into fasting
and not sleeping

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
different techniques

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:84%
for inducing a
state of exhaustion.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Because when we become
exhausted, we surrender.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:36.966 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: You know?

00:40:36.966 --> 00:40:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
that left brain,

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.480 align:middle line:84%
that rational mind is
holding on so tightly.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.620 align:middle line:90%
And the best thing--

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I hate to keep saying Trump
is a good image for things--

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.510 align:middle line:84%
but a writer has
already written a book

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:50.349 align:middle line:90%
about how he's sleep-deprived.

00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
heard about that.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But a writer wrote a
whole book about how

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:90%
he's totally sleep-deprived.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.840 align:middle line:84%
He goes to sleep for
like three hours a night.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And he's on his whatever he's
on in the middle of the night.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And I watch him
because I see him

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:10.130 align:middle line:84%
as a totally exhausted person
on the verge of surrender.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think he's carrying
that archetype in kind

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.800 align:middle line:90%
of an interesting way.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So now let's take
the last part of the show

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.110 align:middle line:10%
and start talking about
how we begin moving forward

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.380 align:middle line:10%
if it's our charge to
begin merging again

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.477 align:middle line:10%
with the intelligence of nature.

00:41:24.477 --> 00:41:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
not just leave it

00:41:26.935 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:84%
to the millennials
to figure it out.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.909 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What is it
we need to begin doing?

00:41:31.909 --> 00:41:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: I love that.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think you can imagine how
busy I am because right now I'm

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.870 align:middle line:84%
writing the second
book in a trilogy.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And I'm
a very busy person.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm teaching
ecstatic trance.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm a teacher for the
Cuyamungue Institute.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And ecstatic trance is,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.207 align:middle line:84%
the most profound way to
return to nature that we have.

00:41:53.207 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
ecstatic trance for a moment.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.290 align:middle line:90%
And do we have a few minutes?

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we do.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Because the
reason ecstatic trance--

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.170 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
ecstatic trance was

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.950 align:middle line:84%
discovered by Dr. Felicitas
Goodman when she was

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:90%
teaching at Denison College.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's a long story, but
she basically discovered that

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:14.040 align:middle line:84%
by holding certain
postures, that when

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
your body is in a
certain posture,

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're using
rattling or drumming

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.570 align:middle line:84%
to go to an altered state,
according to that posture,

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:25.120 align:middle line:84%
you go into a specific
state of consciousness.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, she was a cross-cultural
anthropologist.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And she had studied
all the artifacts

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.420 align:middle line:90%
that we have on the planet.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you start studying
all the artifacts

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:36.660 align:middle line:84%
that we have on this planet in
different parts of the world,

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.080 align:middle line:84%
you start studying them
really carefully, many of them

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.022 align:middle line:90%
are posture instructions.

00:42:42.022 --> 00:42:43.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, many of
them are like figurines

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that have a person standing
in a certain posture.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And so what she discovered
was she discovered

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that when you assume that
posture in the modern era,

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and if you do it tomorrow,
this is what happens,

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.200 align:middle line:84%
you go into a specific
state of consciousness.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you are going
to do divination.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.064 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're going to
be working with healing.

00:43:02.064 --> 00:43:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're going
to be traveling

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
into the upper or
the lower world

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.270 align:middle line:90%
in order to access information.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
critical issue, Regina,

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.602 align:middle line:84%
these postures go through the
whole 100,000 year period.

00:43:13.602 --> 00:43:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you mean by that?

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: What I mean is
the figurines that we have,

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.850 align:middle line:84%
the oldest ones that we have
right now go back around, I

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:23.970 align:middle line:84%
think the oldest one right
now is 57,000 years ago.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.353 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so, therefore,
when you get into this 100,000

00:43:27.353 --> 00:43:31.480 align:middle line:84%
year issue, we don't have much
data from 100 to 60,000 years

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.280 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And then starting
around 60,000 years ago,

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:37.380 align:middle line:90%
we start building up a databank.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what Felicitas
discovered is

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that these postures
were being done

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:45.660 align:middle line:84%
during the Paleolithic age,
during the Neolithic age,

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and during the
mystical magical ages.

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:50.900 align:middle line:90%
And they still work now.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are these like
recognizable yoga type

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.305 align:middle line:90%
postures?

00:43:54.305 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW:
Fortunately, there's

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.800 align:middle line:90%
lots of books about them.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And it depends upon
you have your hand

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:84%
in a certain position, your
leg in a certain position.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And people who are going to
want to look into that they're

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.940 align:middle line:84%
going to have to get one of the
books about ecstatic trance.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.945 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But
what's important

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:11.190 align:middle line:84%
about it is when you go
use one of the postures,

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and you go into an
ecstatic trance,

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:90%
you are at one with nature.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've been a student
of this for 25 years.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And I've been teaching
it when I had time.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't get it
until about a year ago

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that this is the key to go
into oneness with nature.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what I was
saying is it doesn't

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.440 align:middle line:84%
have to be just the
Paleolithic people.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.000 align:middle line:84%
We actually have--
it's literally

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.880 align:middle line:90%
like a key that unlocks a door.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And what happens for people
who practice ecstatic trance

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:45.575 align:middle line:84%
is they start working with
nature in order to heal

00:44:45.575 --> 00:44:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and in order to
change their lives.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They start improving
their gardening.

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.690 align:middle line:84%
They start improving
their health.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They start improving
their eating patterns.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.070 align:middle line:84%
They start improving
their family life.

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
use these postures,

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:84%
these postures give
you the information

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that actually comes
from the earth

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and actually comes
from mother nature.

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel so
strongly about this

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that I'm teaching it even
though I don't have time.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, we
have an institute.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And we've developed a lot of
teachers around the world.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.114 align:middle line:84%
So that at this point
for people to want

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to take classes in
all that it's getting

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.610 align:middle line:90%
to be easier and easier.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Goodman discovered
this in 1977.

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And so then she started
the Institute right away.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.750 align:middle line:90%
And she's not with us anymore.

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:28.560 align:middle line:90%
She was my teacher.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.760 align:middle line:90%
She was wonderful.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But people are going to
be able to study this.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And you also can buy the books
and just do it on your own.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's more
powerful in a group.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Very much like
indigenous people,

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.940 align:middle line:84%
people work with
medicine ways in groups

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's always
more powerful

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.730 align:middle line:90%
when people come together--

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --than it is
when you do it by yourself.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
even ecstatic dance

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.240 align:middle line:84%
takes you to similar
places, not quite as deep

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.060 align:middle line:84%
because you're not in
a quiet body state,

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.230 align:middle line:84%
but does open up those
doorways as well.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know?

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a
little bit, before we

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.110 align:middle line:84%
wrap up now, about the hope
in this configuration in terms

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.920 align:middle line:84%
of what's possible at our
pathway back to peace.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well,
I'm an astrologer.

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:11.630 align:middle line:10%
And the United
States is coming up

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.990 align:middle line:10%
to its Pluto return, which means
that when the United States was

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:10%
formulated Pluto was
in a certain location.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.105 align:middle line:10%
So one of the reasons--

00:46:20.105 --> 00:46:22.730 align:middle line:10%
I could sit here and say why do
we talk about the United States

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:23.240 align:middle line:10%
all the time?

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.865 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, I'm Canadian,
and then there's Europeans too.

00:46:25.865 --> 00:46:28.730 align:middle line:84%
But the reason everybody
talks about the United States

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and focuses on it so much is
because people sense the Pluto

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.990 align:middle line:90%
return.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And when a Pluto return occurs
for a country, what happens

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.350 align:middle line:84%
is the country goes through
a complete transformation

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.180 align:middle line:90%
and a complete purging.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I would
have to say that I

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.206 align:middle line:84%
think it's going to be
a very, very intense

00:46:45.206 --> 00:46:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and probably there's going
to be a lot of violence.

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:50.270 align:middle line:10%
But you know, there already
is a lot of violence.

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As always, the time
has just flown literally.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.866 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to come
back a little later for part

00:46:54.866 --> 00:46:56.980 align:middle line:84%
two of our
conversation about 4D,

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.110 align:middle line:84%
the Annunaki, and their effect
in for the dimensional effect

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:01.175 align:middle line:90%
into the third dimension.

00:47:01.175 --> 00:47:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: OK.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much, Barbara.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.371 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Thank you, Regina.
