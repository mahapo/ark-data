>> REGINA MEREDITH: It has not
been lost on any of you that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:10%
are human behavior is having
a negative impact on our host,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:10%
Mother Earth.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:10%
Martin Ogle, a naturalist with
a degree in wildlife sciences,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:10%
is our guest today, and we'll
be discussing the incredibly

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:10%
intricate dance that occurs
between Earth's mind and ours

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:10%
and what happens when we forget
that we're part of a whole.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Martin.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN OGLE: Thank you.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's good
to have you here.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
important topic I

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.932 align:middle line:84%
mean, we read the headlines
and everyone just goes,

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:90%
ah, what are we going to do?

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we hear all
the reports coming out.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
We've reached that
tipping point.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:84%
The next extinction
is on its way.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And people, like the wonderful
people watching this show,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
who care about such
things feel hopeless,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
like there's nothing
more we can do.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.535 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
that can be done.

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:09.272 align:middle line:84%
No amount of intervention
is going to save us now.

00:01:09.272 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the evening
headlines would indicate,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
on one hand, and then
on the other hand,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.192 align:middle line:84%
depending on which
station you're watching,

00:01:15.192 --> 00:01:16.608 align:middle line:84%
eh, there's nothing
wrong, there's

00:01:16.608 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:90%
no such thing as climate change.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're
having, hopefully,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:84%
a very wise and grounded
and calming discussion

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
about our need for maturity.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Hope so.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I want to
talk about you as a little kid.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:84%
You led a different kind
of life than most people

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
watching who were born and
raised in the Western world.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:90%
You weren't.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us
about your childhood

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and how you ended up being
raised for a number of years

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:90%
in South Korea.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was born there and
lived 10 of my first 14

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:90%
years in South Korea.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:10%
My father was a
Methodist missionary,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:10%
and the work that he did was
largely industrial relations,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:10%
work in steel mills
and coal mines

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:10%
and trying to get labor
rights for workers.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:10%
That was why he went
there or how he got there.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:10%
So I was born there
and lived there

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:10%
and lived a, now I realize,
quite different life than most

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.762 align:middle line:10%
people here.

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about the differences,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
because this shaped who you are,
about what it was like being

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
raised in the East where you
have this, what seems to be,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.023 align:middle line:84%
kind of very dramatic
and even harsher climate

00:02:26.023 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and environment,
in a certain way,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:84%
with these mountains and so
forth that you were playing

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:90%
in as a kid.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
life in the East

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and life in that
environment and how

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.150 align:middle line:84%
you started really connecting
with this notion of time

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:90%
and Earth.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Korea is a very
mountainous country.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise and similarly,
it's very much like Virginia,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
where I lived much of my life,
in climate and topography

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:84%
It is very highly
populated, however,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and so I grew up in a very
crowded, dense environment,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and I was pretty much
the only Caucasian child

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to be found other
than my sisters.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of, obviously,
set a tone for my life.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that I really loved to do

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:84%
was to go up in the
mountains and go mountain

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:84%
climbing with my
father or whoever else.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And that obviously set
a very meaningful part

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
of my young existence that got
me into the kinds of things

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:90%
that I love to do now.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Was being in nature
or a part of nature part

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Eastern
culture at that time?

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah, I think so.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
At that time, of course, Korea
was only about 15 years out

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of the war when I was first
to third, fourth grade.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
decimated landscape.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a different
thing kind of going out,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle line:90%
quote, unquote, "into nature."

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
But then and even now, people
love to go mountain climbing.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
You'll go anywhere,
even in Seoul,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and some of the mountains that
are right in and around Seoul

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
always have people
all over them.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.483 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Many years ago,
probably when you were--

00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
because you're a
little younger than me,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:84%
so probably when you
were a kid there,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.365 align:middle line:84%
I would fly in and out because
I worked with an airline,

00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
World Airways, who was flying
troops in and out of Seoul,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:90%
And I remember the landscape.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:90%
I was there in the winter.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
landscape at the time

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:84%
and thinking how stark it
was from my point of view,

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
but now we're probably coming
in through military base is

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:90%
my guess, looking back on it.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
But I remember
just kind of the--

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%
there was a certain
Spartan quality to it,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.095 align:middle line:84%
but there was a
real beauty in that.

00:04:32.095 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
seeing the mounds,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.403 align:middle line:84%
the burial mounds and such
that I had never seen before,

00:04:36.403 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and was just having people
explain all of it and all

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
the scents of the
kimchi barrels,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
once we were in
the towns and such,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and such a completely different
sensual experience compared

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to living, growing up--
well, I'm from San Francisco

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
and Marin County--

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:90%
very different, obviously.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.307 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Part of what
I'm getting at, too,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
is the nature of life
because you were living more

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.440 align:middle line:90%
their life.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you were moving
into an expat community

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of
Europeans and Americans

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and the pace and the
way we do things.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:84%
You were moving in with the
pace of another group of people.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:10%
My first five years, we
lived in a house that

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:10%
was in a Korean
neighborhood and pretty much

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:10%
a Korean-style
house for the time.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
In later years, we moved
into a slightly bigger, more

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
kind of Western-style
house, but we were still

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:84%
within the Korean community,
and that did make a difference.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, looking back
on how I grew up

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and comparing it to how
my kids grew up now,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:90%
it was a very different world.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And the time aspect that we've
brought up here, I think,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:90%
did make a difference.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
that's something that

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:90%
is found all over the place.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago, life was slower
no matter where you were.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: And so it
was slower there,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was lived at a pace
that kind of, I think,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
is more commensurate with
the human body and mind.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And philosophically,
was the Korean understanding

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
that they were part of nature
and nature is part of us,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:90%
we're all one and the same?

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
That's abstract thinking
for a little kid.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Did any of that
feeling come up then?

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Like here, the Native
American culture, for example,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is known for never
having disconnected

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
from Mother Earth,
Father Sky, and so forth.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.508 align:middle line:84%
As a child, it would have
been a little bit abstract.

00:06:25.508 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But what carried
through is that there

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of different
religious traditions

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
that were already there,
and then Christianity

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
was being mixed into
that and so forth.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So you had Buddhism, and even
the ancient shamanism was still

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.215 align:middle line:90%
present and Shintoism.

00:06:41.215 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:84%
It was all there and I think
informed people's lives

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I can't speak to it
in a scholarly way.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But looking back on it,
I feel like my resonance

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of feelings
about, for instance,

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:84%
this Gaia theory idea that
I'd been very much into--

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I was very amenable to
that because just the way

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.345 align:middle line:84%
I thought being steeped in
that culture and that language.

00:07:02.345 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:84%
That's a hypothesis
that I have about why I

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:90%
came to love this idea so much.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And explain
what the idea is.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.037 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: The Gaia theory idea?

00:07:11.037 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, so Gaia
theory, as a science,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
is the scientific idea that
Earth is a single living

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
quibble about words,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
like is it an organism
or a cell or whatever,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
but I just feel like it's
a single living system.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's scientifically
verifiable.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:84%
It basically is our present
earth system science.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
But the source of the
metaphor Gaia, I think,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
ties into that science
and is an interesting part

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:90%
of the history of it.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Explain that, Gaia.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.100 align:middle line:10%
>> OGLE: The scientist who
came up with this idea,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:10%
his name is James
Lovelock, and he is a Brit.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:10%
And he was hired by
NASA back in the 1960s

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:10%
to find out whether or not
there was life on Mars.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.797 align:middle line:10%
And he came and he worked
with folks like Carl Sagan,

00:07:59.797 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:10%
and they said, how are we
going to determine this?

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:10%
And at that time, you
couldn't go to Mars,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:10%
but you could measure the
atmosphere of other planets.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:10%
And so they did that.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:10%
And just based, basically, on
the composition of the Martian

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:10%
atmosphere, he came
to the conclusion

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:10%
that there was no life
on Mars because it

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:10%
was a static atmosphere,
an atmosphere that might be

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:10%
kind of like an EKG going flat.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.293 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's happening.

00:08:27.293 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: At least nothing
detectable at that time.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Detectable
at that time--

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:90%
that's true.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
But based on that, he told NASA
that he didn't think that there

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:90%
was any life on Mars.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Having had a chance to talk with
him, he said that then at least

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
we proved that there
was life on Earth.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of
chuckles a little bit

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:84%
because his point was that that
was his flash of insight where

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:84%
you're saying, we weren't
really even testing

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:84%
to see if there was
life on the planet.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
We were testing to see
if the planet itself,

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
in some way, shape, or
form, was a living system.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And so he saw what is on Earth
and our atmospheric composition

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and said that,
well, really, Earth

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:84%
is a living system, the whole
thing, the rock, the water,

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:90%
the air, the organisms.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where his
Gaia hypothesis, then,

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.157 align:middle line:84%
was born just out of
that simple insight.

00:09:15.157 --> 00:09:16.115 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yea.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Our ancestors knew
you couldn't separate from

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.650 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, that they were part
of this living system of Gaia.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And so at what point
in our Western history

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:84%
did we start removing ourselves
and considering ourselves

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.298 align:middle line:84%
above the Earth which has
given birth to all of us?

00:09:37.298 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, that's
a big question,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not a scholar either.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But having really been
interested in, first,

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:84%
the science, and then
how our culture views

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that science, and
then the metaphor,

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:90%
I have my ideas on it.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's where we
started to separate things

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.350 align:middle line:90%
out even conceptually.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So the term "Gaia" is
from ancient Greece,

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Greek
Goddess of Earth.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:10%
But shortly into, like, say,
the classical Greek period,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:10%
we had a time period where
we were separating out words

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:10%
already so that, for instance,
"physis" was originally

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:10%
the Greek word for nature.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And then there were separations
into "physis" became more

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:84%
the physical world, and
"bios," which previously was

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.680 align:middle line:84%
a way of life or the human
existence in the Earth,

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:84%
became biology and separated out
into those kinds of thoughts.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And then later on in Europe,
we really ran with that.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
We named entire disciplines--
geology, and biology,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:90%
and geometry, et cetera.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we began to
separate our thinking.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And then once our
thinking became separated,

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have the
intuitive connection

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:84%
to seeing that those used to
be just viscerally thought

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:90%
as one and the same.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet, in the
sort of mystical sense,

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.642 align:middle line:84%
during the same ages,
it was understood.

00:11:04.642 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Again, you have you scientists
of the day, of course,

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
who began parting it
out characteristically,

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:84%
the features of what
Earth represented.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you still had
the mystical sects,

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
which carried forward more
ancient knowledge, which

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
actually considered the
Earth as an entity herself,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:84%
as among the other planets,
almost as having ruling

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%
entities, archangels
that were giving

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
guidance to the development
of all these planets.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
because, at that time,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:84%
those philosophies
were not non-existence.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
They were running
alongside, and they

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
were highly respected
among certain groups

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
of people and even the
masses, to a large extent.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:84%
So the masses still
believed that Mother Earth

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
is an entity that has
intelligence and gives

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.160 align:middle line:90%
us guidance.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere
along the way, that

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:90%
was squashed out completely.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: I think that what
you're describing happened,

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.200 align:middle line:84%
but also that it
was a slow process,

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:90%
that it didn't happen overnight.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And an example of that is
if you take a geology course

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.750 align:middle line:84%
these days you find out
that Robert Hutton was

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:90%
the father of geology.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:90%
This was back in the 1700s.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:84%
He was a medical
doctor by training,

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and he came to see Earth
as having a physiology,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and he was interested
in the rocks and kind

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of geologic principles
as understanding

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:90%
the physiology of the planet.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
He actually called
it a super organism.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:84%
So even at that point
in European history,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
there was still a lot of
understanding and carryover

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:84%
of kind of more ancient
views of things,

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:84%
of Earth as being a mother
and our source of life.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:84%
But then, as time went on,
those separations continued,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and I dare say that most
geology students today

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
don't know that
"g" is from "Gaia"

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and that Robert Hutton
was a medical doctor

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and that he was interested
in Earth as a super organism.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.167 align:middle line:84%
So we slowly start to
separate over time.

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and then with
that came what I consider to be

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
a type of arrogance in which,
as we developed our intellect,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
especially as education became
more available to the masses

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and such, as we began to
develop the intellect,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
we started forgetting about
the notion of intelligence.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
difficult to even conceive

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:84%
of what could fashion something
like an Earth, no less

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.940 align:middle line:90%
a rose blossom, you know?

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:84%
What can fashion
something like that?

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:84%
What kind of intelligence can
make for such complex systems

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:90%
depending upon one another?

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, this notion of
intellect versus intelligence--

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:90%
natural intelligence.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Can you flow into
that a little bit?

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: The word "arrogance"
is interesting to me, too,

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:84%
because, especially these
days, I think everyone is kind

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.810 align:middle line:84%
of at odds and loggerheads,
and we consider the other side

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:90%
arrogant.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.317 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think more that we
really think that we're right.

00:13:52.317 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We think we're right.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on our
experience and our knowledge

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:90%
and everything about us.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And so we end up entrenching
into different sides,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I think, a little bit
too easily these days.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm
interested in is maybe

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
finding out if we can
talk to each other

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
about each other's
intelligences and intellect

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to figure out
the best understanding.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, even this
idea of how Earth came to be,

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be probably
forever swathed the mystery.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.635 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and that's
a question that's--

00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
it's a valid question that
needs to be talked about.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Right.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of scientific
understanding of that,

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.425 align:middle line:84%
but that still goes back
to ultimate realities

00:14:37.425 --> 00:14:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know
that we'll ever

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
be able to solve
even scientifically.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
language growing up--

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons
why I came to think

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.730 align:middle line:84%
that I did resonate
with the Gaia theory

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:54.730 align:middle line:84%
is that the Gaia theory
implies that there's systems

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and balance can emerge with
no forethought, just out

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.800 align:middle line:84%
of its own accord, just out
of the natural way of things.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I found out as an adult
that the character for nature

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that's often used in the Orient,
stemming from the Chinese,

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
is two characters, "of
itself so, of itself so,"

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same word that's
often used for "spontaneous--"

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
in other words, there's
no need to conceive

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
a committee or a single
power, although that

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:90%
could be creating the Earth.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:84%
You get a order and a balance
and a harmony that arises out

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.240 align:middle line:90%
of a system, of itself so.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And so if we were to talk
to each other in those ways,

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe we'd find
out that we kind of

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
feel the same, even though
we're using different language.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
More and more of that might
lead to better understanding

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and agreement between people
rather than loggerheads.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.512 align:middle line:84%
But then we have to
assume we don't already

00:15:57.512 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:90%
know all the answers.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yes, absolutely.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a problem.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.645 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem that can--

00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
it's not a problem
that can't be fixed,

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's a problem
at the moment,

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:84%
especially as we look
at how polarized society

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.820 align:middle line:90%
and viewpoints have become.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But then let's extend
that notion out to nature.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
based on opposites.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything is based on the
need for the poles to interact.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
There's polarity in everything,
positive and negative, right?

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's essential just for
creation itself on all levels.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same time,
the Earth and all systems

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:84%
are naturally
seeking homeostasis.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's a really
interesting prospect

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.788 align:middle line:84%
that humanity-- if we can
kind of go along that line

00:16:38.788 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about and finding

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
that way culturally and
socially between us,

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:84%
it's like there is a
point to the polarity

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
because it does bring
different knowledge bases

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and such into the
equation, but ultimately it

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:90%
has to result in homeostasis.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And homeostasis
isn't exactly what

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:90%
society's aiming at right now.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Homeostasis, of
course, is one thing

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:84%
that scientists have had a
little problem with in terms

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Gaia theory because
they say, oh, Earth

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.837 align:middle line:90%
has never had a homeostasis.

00:17:08.837 --> 00:17:10.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
conditions have always

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:84%
changed through vast
periods of time.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.525 align:middle line:84%
But what is true is there's
been vast periods of homeostasis

00:17:16.525 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:90%
within that.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: So for instance, so we
have 21% oxygen and it's proved

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:84%
that that's probably been that
case for about 200 million

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
years, a nice healthy
chunk of time.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, enough
to allow life to flourish.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Life as we know it
today because life before

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:90%
flourished in a different--

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In a
different way-- yeah.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: --world
in a different way.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.458 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Different species.

00:17:37.458 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: And so for
us as human beings,

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I guess my concern is that
we don't change that existing

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
homeostasis too much such that
it would become harmful for us

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:90%
and our immediate descendants.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:84%
It will change eventually,
and we may or may not

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:90%
be a part of the mix.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
it'd be good if we

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:84%
could have our grandkids
live in a world that's

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:90%
somewhat the same as ours.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.685 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, this
is part of the problem.

00:18:03.685 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:84%
We are part of that
mix of the change.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
some of the challenges

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
because these aren't things
that are unknown to the viewers,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
but what the implications of
this mean in the long term.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:84%
For example, the oxygen
rates of this planet

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.630 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
deforestation alone,

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.377 align:middle line:90%
what's happening with this?

00:18:21.377 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, I think the
oxygen rates themselves right

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
now are still
pretty close to 21%.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you couldn't
have large vertebrates

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.033 align:middle line:90%
of any kind living at 17%.

00:18:33.033 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the clues that we

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
have that it's never dropped
below that over, say, 200

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:90%
million years.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
that's good news.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.433 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah, that's good news.

00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But other things,
notably carbon dioxide,

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:84%
are going in slight but
very significant directions,

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:90%
and that's just a fact.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And its impact on
climate, for instance,

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that's already happened is
also factual and verifiable.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
The impact into the future, we
can argue about it all we want,

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:84%
but the scientific
read right now

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.748 align:middle line:84%
is that it's headed in really
dangerous ways for humanity.

00:19:06.748 --> 00:19:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because we're
talking about the environment,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about becoming
responsible grown ups

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and working within
this living system,

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:84%
as part of this living system,
it's certainly fair to point

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:84%
out where we've been
living outside of that.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.383 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that has to do
with what I call ignorance

00:19:23.383 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:84%
in the truest sense of the word,
which is not that we don't have

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, that we choose to
ignore it, for the most part,

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:84%
which is what ignorance
is, is to ignore.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And so if we choose to
live in this ignorance,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
obviously what you're
just talking about,

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
we're headed down
a particular path.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But then, again, you look at
some of the-- one little bit

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I've been on recently is the
notion of just the one out

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:84%
of thousands and thousands
of problems, which

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:84%
is what's dropping on us
from the sky, heavy aluminum

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
loads from jet fuel and also
chemtrails and contrails alike,

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and just what this
one thing does to all

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:90%
the species on the planet.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when it comes to the
subject of climate change--

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
these things actually change
climate, literally move weather

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:90%
fronts and so forth--

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:90%
the subject never even comes up.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.480 align:middle line:84%
How can you even begin a
discourse on climate change

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:84%
when you're changing the
climate literally in the sky

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.935 align:middle line:90%
and not acknowledging it?

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, I guess one
read on that is that there are

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:84%
so many-- you bring up aluminum,
and there's so many other ways,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
whether it be CO2 or
aluminum or whatever else,

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:90%
that are concurrently happening.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it's almost
impossible for any one person

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:84%
to be totally aware of all the
different things happening.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me like
the single unifying factor

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.640 align:middle line:84%
is that we continue to produce
more and more new things

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and more and more stuff and
use it and put it into the air

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.730 align:middle line:90%
kind of haphazardly.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And so scientifically,
we're kind

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
of approaching our lives
in a sloppy manner,

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and we're making things
bad for ourselves

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:90%
and for future generations.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go back to
one of the simplest things.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
was really intrigued

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:84%
with about your work is we're
looking at some of what we're

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:84%
doing on more of a technological
and substantive level and just

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:90%
material level to planet Earth.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:90%
We know we have problems.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:84%
We know we have to
find our way out.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, I don't understand
how that's going to happen.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.352 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
the human species

00:21:23.352 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth is
just going to have

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to this reality
we've created because who's

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:90%
going to change it, really?

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can change
certain policies, absolutely.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.350 align:middle line:84%
We can certainly
change where it has

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.463 align:middle line:84%
to do with some of
the kind of toxins

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
we talked about a moment
ago, but not the huge load.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Just take a flight alone.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to stop flying?

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to stop these
industries from happening?

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to stop that
load on the environment?

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's willing to
give up the perks

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that they've come to
appreciate of modern life

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:90%
to a significant extent.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the case,
let's take the conversation

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:90%
beyond that.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Earth does adapt.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Earth is going to be here
long after we're gone.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Species are going
to become extinct.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Other species will
be able to thrive

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:84%
in whatever the new
environment is, I suppose.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can just look at
it as our species may

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:84%
be one of those that just
isn't able to really adapt

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
quickly enough or maybe we
will be super fast adapters.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But one thing we can get back
to is this notion of mind.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, Gaia has
an incredibly complex

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've also read, in
other books and such,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:84%
even it's her, its own
emotions and so forth.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a complex,
multidimensional being

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
just as we're complex,
multidimensional beings.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So how do our minds and
our emotions work together?

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: That's a really
interesting question.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I like to
think of is that we ourselves

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
are just seamlessly
interconnected with Gaia,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
with life, with our world
such that we grew out of her.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, everything about
us did, including our minds,

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:90%
including the ways we think.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I used to think
in a metaphoric sense,

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
but now I think, really,
in a literal sense.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:84%
When we as human beings acquired
all the different skills

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that we have and abilities
and we invented a camera,

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and then we invented
a spacecraft

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and went out to outer space
and took a picture back,

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:42.227 align:middle line:84%
that that was quite literally
Earth becoming self-conscious.

00:23:42.227 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an interesting
thing to think of it--

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's interesting.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: --as literally,
not just metaphoric,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
because if we did evolve out
of this planet and our minds

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and everything about us did
evolve out of this planet,

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:84%
then that's quite
literally what it is.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we start to think in
that way, at least to me,

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:84%
it gives us a new view,
perhaps an optimistic view,

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:08.610 align:middle line:84%
that we could evolve fast
enough to do things differently

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
in the short term, short
term meaning let's get

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.630 align:middle line:84%
our policy and our actions and
everything fixed in short order

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:84%
so that our kids and
grandkids have a good life

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:90%
to expect into the future.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
practical ways in which

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I've been interested
about that is just,

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.820 align:middle line:84%
what would it take for us
to imagine and then create

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
a truly green
economy, as they say,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:84%
not a green-washed economy,
but a green economy in which we

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
really did things differently,
fundamentally differently,

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:43.300 align:middle line:84%
so that we could live more in
homeostasis with the systems

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:90%
around us?

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's possible.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think it is, too.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I love
that topic, so I

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
would like you to share that,
your thoughts on that with us

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and your idea of what these--
and I know this isn't your job

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to create these systems,
but just your vision of what

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.877 align:middle line:84%
these systems could look
like so people can get

00:25:02.877 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
an idea in their own
minds is how they could

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:84%
begin to even think this way and
start contributing in this way.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, first would be at
least an awareness that things

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:84%
don't always have to be
the way they are now.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just our
human nature necessarily

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
just to go consuming
ourselves to death

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and hurrying ourselves
to death and plunging off

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:84%
into the darkness
with those behaviors,

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that people have lived
differently in the past

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and have envisioned
different ways of living now.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:84%
There's entire groups
of people that have

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.728 align:middle line:90%
chosen to live differently now.

00:25:36.728 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So at least that's a
starting point where--

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.062 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Give us some examples
of what you think are really

00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:90%
good models for this.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, even if you
just take between Europe

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and the United States, Europeans
literally consume about half

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:84%
the resources per
capita than we do.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And so in the modern
world and what

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
we would still call a
very first-world nation,

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.780 align:middle line:84%
there's people living very
differently than we do.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that they
profess their own happiness

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and well-being as being at
least as good if not better

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:90%
than our own.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.890 align:middle line:90%
So there's one model.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Then you could go to any
number of other countries

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:84%
around the world where they
use vastly less resources.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they have
their own challenges

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
of health and
pollution and so forth,

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
but maybe that's
because they're immersed

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:84%
in kind of the first
world at the same time.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're trying to
play catch-up on the material

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.250 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: They're
playing catch-up.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime,
many are living

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.630 align:middle line:84%
lives that are happy
and well adjusted

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.290 align:middle line:90%
and meaningful to them.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole
range of different ways

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:90%
that we can live in this world.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.180 align:middle line:84%
If we start there, then
we have created potential

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:84%
to change our lives in ways
that won't look anything

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.320 align:middle line:90%
like they do today.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:90%
They'll look very differently.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.563 align:middle line:84%
But they have potential
to live on through time.

00:26:58.563 --> 00:27:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It seems like
one of the hallmarks,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.897 align:middle line:84%
as you were talking about,
even as the differences between

00:27:02.897 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Europeans and Americans, is that
there isn't the incredible rush

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:84%
for instant gratification
through consumption.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.402 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Yeah, at least
not to the level we are.

00:27:13.402 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what
I'm saying, not as much.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:10%
Having grown up in Korea and
revisited there a couple times,

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:10%
I would say, just as off the
cuff, that in Korea and Japan,

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:10%
maybe China these days, wherever
the economy is roaring along,

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:10%
we are more hurried and harried
than other parts of the world.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:84%
There's other challenges that
other parts of the world face.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:84%
But as far as being really
hurried and harried,

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that's an affliction of rapid
economic growth, I think.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think so.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Even, as you say,
40, 50 years ago,

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:84%
when a young couple got
married, they would maybe

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.970 align:middle line:84%
be gifted some things for their
household, the development

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of their household, or they
would get their money together

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.353 align:middle line:84%
and credit wasn't extended
so much at that time,

00:27:59.353 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and they would buy
the necessary things,

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and they'd buy
good things, solid,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:84%
made-in-America maple furniture
of the 1950s is a good example.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But then a household might
have that same furniture--

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:84%
those people might have it
most of their lives, things

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:84%
that were made well and that
they paid decent money for,

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.810 align:middle line:84%
they respected, took
care of, and that

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:90%
was your household furniture.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:84%
You didn't just change
with a new edition

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:84%
of a fashion magazine or
an architectural magazine.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
You didn't just throw
out your old furniture

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:29.540 align:middle line:90%
and bring in the new.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
talking about, this more

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:90%
of an instant gratification.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Same thing in Europe and
America where people would

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:90%
buy clothing that would last.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:84%
You'd wear the same wool
coat for maybe five, 10,

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.130 align:middle line:84%
15 years because it was
made well to begin with,

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.715 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't about
having to have

00:28:45.715 --> 00:28:46.840 align:middle line:90%
a new statement every year.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It was about having something
good that serviced you year

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.750 align:middle line:90%
after year.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.240 align:middle line:84%
That thinking is
pretty much gone.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's not a
reflection of our world today.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the
newest whatever you think

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:84%
is going to meet approval
in that time period

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:84%
to be with the fashion or a
certain amount of boredom,

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.038 align:middle line:84%
the affliction of boredom,
like, eh, I want to change the--

00:29:11.038 --> 00:29:12.455 align:middle line:84%
I don't like my
apartment anymore.

00:29:12.455 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to
swap this out if you can.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So this notion of this
gratification on a material

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:84%
level is really, I
think, deeply at the core

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
of this materialistic,
consumptive characteristic

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:84%
of our culture and the
destruction it's causing.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of
the way we think,

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.550 align:middle line:84%
because we're driven to
do those things because we

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:90%
feel like we need to keep up.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:84%
The old phrase was, "Keep
up with the Joneses."

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And now it's really gone to a
much greater extent than even

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.520 align:middle line:90%
in the '50s, '60s, and '70s.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of diminishing
returns, I guess you could say,

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:84%
that we probably benefited
from a lot of the material

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and health and other gains
that our society provided us.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But then, if we continue
to go faster and faster

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and feel like we
need more and more,

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.503 align:middle line:84%
we disconnect ourselves
from our surroundings.

00:30:01.503 --> 00:30:03.420 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
disconnecting from nature.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, one aspect of nature that
would disconnect ourselves from

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:90%
is a much slower pace of life.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: And so we come to
consider that the only way

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.860 align:middle line:84%
to live is faster and faster
or as fast as we're going now,

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.048 align:middle line:84%
at least, and to purchase
more and more new items.

00:30:20.048 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're being
persuaded to do this through

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
the media machine
that we're bathed in.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.805 align:middle line:90%
Suggestions are everywhere.

00:30:26.805 --> 00:30:28.430 align:middle line:84%
You can't drive down
a street in a city

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and not have suggestions
coming at you as to what

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:32.750 align:middle line:90%
you should be consuming next.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the documentary I love
is called "Century of Self,"

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:42.110 align:middle line:84%
absolutely brilliant, talking
about the art of persuasion

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.240 align:middle line:84%
starting in the 1920s
and '30s and what's

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle line:84%
happened to our
cultures as a result

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:52.208 align:middle line:84%
of these persuasive forces that
put us into a consumptive mode.

00:30:52.208 --> 00:30:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's all
we're really being

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:90%
encouraged to do is to consume.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to
look at that way,

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.530 align:middle line:84%
then we're being prodded to be
dissatisfied with the things

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.330 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.332 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: And I'm wondering
if it's possible that,

00:31:05.332 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:84%
about this time, we, in
fact, are starting to become

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
dissatisfied at being
constantly dissatisfied.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, that's
a perfect way to put it.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: And I wonder if younger
generations are, in fact,

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
at that point where there
are notable trends where less

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:84%
homeownership and car ownership
and so forth and that it might

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:29.690 align:middle line:84%
be part of a new understanding,
a new awareness of who we are

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and what is meaningful because
we've become dissatisfied

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.547 align:middle line:84%
at being prodded
to be dissatisfied.

00:31:35.547 --> 00:31:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Dissatisfied--
I love that.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:90%
That's a perfect way to put it.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And I see evidence
of this, as well,

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the
younger generations where

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:84%
they're wanting to do more,
not necessarily own so much.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, future
generations are always

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:52.320 align:middle line:84%
the key to any kind of healing
process that's going to happen.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.680 align:middle line:90%
And I think you're right.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.800 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:84%
We're not wanting to
be manipulated and told

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
what to do in the
ways generations

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.692 align:middle line:90%
up until now have accepted.

00:32:02.692 --> 00:32:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: I think that's true.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And relating it a little bit
to what we were talking about

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:84%
earlier with this whole
understanding of Earth

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:84%
as a system and the wisdom
that our ancestors had,

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we do need to link
this new trend of young people

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to both of those things,
the scientific understanding

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:84%
of Earth as living
system and the fact

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:84%
that all of our
forbearers have understood

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Earth and our relationship
to be different, because then

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.070 align:middle line:84%
their desire to do
things differently

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:84%
is rooted in some
real firm foundation

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
kind of reactive.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: My worry would be that
if it's just reactive, well,

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.770 align:middle line:84%
then once they kind of discover
that it doesn't work for them

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.210 align:middle line:84%
in any way, shape,
or form, well,

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:84%
then they'll just get
back on the bandwagon.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But if they
rediscover things that

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:56.030 align:middle line:84%
are really meaningful and really
true in all sense of the word,

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.710 align:middle line:84%
then they have
something that they

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.952 align:middle line:84%
can lay a groundwork
of their life upon.

00:33:00.952 --> 00:33:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One of the things
I'm really encouraged about is

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:07.220 align:middle line:84%
there are some new magazines
and journals coming out that are

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.180 align:middle line:84%
more lifestyle oriented that
really promote a life much

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.330 align:middle line:84%
closer to nature, whether
it's doing your own gardening,

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:19.730 align:middle line:84%
knitting your own sweaters,
and whatever it is,

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.430 align:middle line:84%
planting your own, be
attracting flowers.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
That's really a
huge new trend right

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.380 align:middle line:90%
now in the magazine business.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.088 align:middle line:10%
And one of my
favorites is called--

00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:29.630 align:middle line:10%
I think it called
"Mary Jane's Farm."

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:10%
I absolutely love it--
great little articles

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.330 align:middle line:10%
on living closer to Earth
and things that matter.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
trend is starting

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:84%
to happen in earnest now because
people want to feel meaning

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.570 align:middle line:84%
again, tired of just consuming,
consuming, consuming.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I asked this earlier, and we
didn't really talk about it--

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
do you have, in your
own mind, an idea

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:54.920 align:middle line:84%
of what a green economy,
an organic, workable, green

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.855 align:middle line:90%
economy can look like?

00:33:56.855 --> 00:33:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, I certainly
do in my own mind,

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and I could sketch
out that a little.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I'd like that.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: But I think that the
most important part would be

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:84%
for us to co-create it so
that it works for everyone.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Most notably, some
examples could

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.949 align:middle line:84%
serve as a starting point, and
then we need to go beyond that.

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I've often touted the
work of William McDonough,

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:84%
He's known as the Green Dean
at the University of Virginia.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And he works with
various industries

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.900 align:middle line:84%
to take what they had been doing
that might have been horribly

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.780 align:middle line:84%
polluting and very
unsustainable and at least take

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.360 align:middle line:84%
those first steps
towards making it

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:84%
something that could be
sustainable into the future.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, his
three guiding principles

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:84%
are use daily solar
incoming energy,

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:84%
so renewable energy-- and
that's almost a no-brainer,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.760 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be accompanied
with other things.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:52.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the two other principles
he uses is waste equals food,

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.719 align:middle line:84%
and what he really
means is that we

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:84%
have to do away with the
idea of waste completely.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So in whatever we
do in our economy,

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
if there was a byproduct of
some process, manufacturing

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:84%
or other, but it had
to be designed where

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that byproduct was useful
for some other product

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.630 align:middle line:84%
or some other process, then
we'd be fundamentally changing

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:84%
our economy to begin with--
so if that really was the way

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.420 align:middle line:90%
we designed things.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And then his last principle
was called honor diversity.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
talk about honoring

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:29.870 align:middle line:84%
human diversity these days,
which is absolutely necessary.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But what if we honor the
diversity of our whole place?

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So in a region that we
lived, we honored the fact

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that it has this climate
and these resources

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of setting,
like topography and everything

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.950 align:middle line:84%
about a place, the
animals and plants.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:84%
We would figure out ways
to live in that region,

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.780 align:middle line:84%
in that place, that are far
different than how we do things

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.580 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.538 align:middle line:84%
And it would look a little
different everywhere

00:35:53.538 --> 00:35:54.980 align:middle line:90%
you go because of that.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So even though that's
not the be-all, end-all,

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I think this kind of thinking
is the starting point

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.530 align:middle line:90%
for designing a new economy.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And if kids get excited about
this and say, we can do this,

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to arm ourselves
with both outlook and facts

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:14.720 align:middle line:84%
that will help us do this, then
we're that much further ahead.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And even the efforts,
even though we're not

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:19.870 align:middle line:84%
going to get into a
political discussion here,

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:23.170 align:middle line:84%
but even the efforts of
the new enthusiastic people

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:27.190 align:middle line:84%
entering Congress and going
for the New Green Deal,

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.380 align:middle line:84%
this is hopeful
that this is even

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
being brought into
the conversation,

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:34.012 align:middle line:84%
as soon as they kind of
hop into their new seats

00:36:34.012 --> 00:36:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and are warming up their
seats in Congress, that they

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.250 align:middle line:84%
want to hop on this notion
and make this such a priority.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you get
all the immature behavior

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and backlash where the
news says, oh, we're

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.923 align:middle line:84%
going to lose our hamburgers
and our way of life

00:36:46.923 --> 00:36:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and our milkshakes
and everything.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just, again,
this whole need

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:54.640 align:middle line:84%
to have to divide
people into these really

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:90%
almost caricature-ish camps.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.390 align:middle line:90%
That has to go.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.218 align:middle line:84%
We have to not support
these interests anymore.

00:37:01.218 --> 00:37:02.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a big one.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Just unplug.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't give them our money.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't give them our time.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Don't give them our attention.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But it is encouraging to
me that this is happening.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And with the Green New Deal, if
we could accompany new thoughts

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:18.590 align:middle line:84%
like that with new interests and
abilities to talk to each other

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:84%
so that when we talk
about a Green New Deal

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:84%
we know that we're talking about
an economy-- and an economy

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.310 align:middle line:90%
isn't an evil thing inherently.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we do into the
future, our business

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:84%
will be whatever
economy we produce.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And so our main idea is to
try to talk to each other

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and figure out the best ways
to proceed rather than putting

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.780 align:middle line:84%
each other in these
caricature-ish camps

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.580 align:middle line:90%
that you describe.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a bipartisan
committee on what would that

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:50.080 align:middle line:84%
look like-- how can we begin
to incorporate industry

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and our future economic growth
in with these principles that

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely
needed at this time?

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, to me
it's encouraging

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:01.583 align:middle line:84%
that, even if it's all being
treated so ridiculously,

00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:03.250 align:middle line:84%
it's important that
it's even coming up.

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think it could go
faster if we did one thing,

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and that is to make part
of our education system,

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.000 align:middle line:84%
especially at the
high-school level,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
not to not do it elsewhere,
but to get kids thinking about

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.260 align:middle line:84%
whatever their career is,
whatever their own skills

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and aptitudes are, that they not
only can but they must be part

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.530 align:middle line:84%
of redesigning and
imagining a new economy--

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: --rather than just
having some kids that maybe

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.820 align:middle line:84%
think that they want to be
environmentally minded go

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:37.930 align:middle line:84%
into some kind of environmental
science as if that, by itself,

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:38.990 align:middle line:90%
would fix the world.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.370 align:middle line:84%
If you love fashion and
you want to be a fashion

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.830 align:middle line:84%
designer as a young
girl, figure out a way

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:48.220 align:middle line:84%
to make it work so it
doesn't rely on $0.65 an hour

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.640 align:middle line:84%
sweatshop workers, for
example, and hemp materials

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.628 align:middle line:90%
and all of this.

00:38:52.628 --> 00:38:53.920 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree with you more.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.660 align:middle line:84%
High school educate--
that level where

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.990 align:middle line:84%
people are lit up and ready to
choose, somewhat, some of them,

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:90%
their path in life.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:middle line:84%
What a perfect way to
start planting those seeds.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.180 align:middle line:84%
To do that, what we started
talking about with a Gaia

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:12.400 align:middle line:84%
principle and the Gaia idea is
not an esoteric sideline thing.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It's understanding how this
world works as a living system,

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and then understanding
ourselves as part of that,

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and then getting into the really
complex emotional connections

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.100 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.360 align:middle line:84%
That's where we often venture
over into things like metaphor,

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and myth, and
religion, et cetera,

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.781 align:middle line:84%
that those things
are important, too,

00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:39.920 align:middle line:84%
to our ultimate aim to live well
on this Earth into the future.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what happens
with Darwinism at this point,

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.990 align:middle line:84%
survival of the fittest,
dominance and so forth?

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, that's a really
interesting thing to bring up,

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:54.970 align:middle line:84%
too, because I feel like
our current economy is still

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.320 align:middle line:84%
basically running on
Social Darwinism--

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: --that phrase that the
industrialists themselves came

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.910 align:middle line:84%
up with to describe
what they were doing.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.250 align:middle line:84%
But it still is
the way we think.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It's that the world is simply
and only run on competition.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Competition is a
big part of how life works,

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.950 align:middle line:84%
but the kind of Gaian
mirror image to that is that

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.460 align:middle line:90%
we're also a symbiotic system.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have symbiosis,
in human terms,

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.650 align:middle line:84%
cooperation, kind of
working with competition

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.150 align:middle line:90%
and natural selection.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.940 align:middle line:10%
And Lynn Margulis, who is one
of the scientists who really

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:10%
supported the Gaia
theory during her life,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.390 align:middle line:10%
had a phrase that she used, and
it went something like this--

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:47.760 align:middle line:10%
it was, symbiosis wrote
the symphony of life,

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.820 align:middle line:10%
and natural selection edited it.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:52.696 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Edited it.

00:40:52.696 --> 00:40:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Edited it.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And what that tells us is
that if we had a story that

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:02.400 align:middle line:84%
accompanied how the world
really works that wasn't Social

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Darwinism but was a social
understanding of ourselves

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:84%
as part of a living
planet, then we'd

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:84%
be in a completely
different place in order

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to imagine ourselves
into the future.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And in doing
so, we can't cut technology

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:24.095 align:middle line:84%
and technological advancement
out of the argument.

00:41:24.095 --> 00:41:24.895 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:41:24.895 --> 00:41:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or the
debate, I should say.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: And of course,
technology could also be seen

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:29.610 align:middle line:90%
for what it is.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Technology is everything we
do to manipulate and change

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.260 align:middle line:90%
our world.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, for instance,
when we did education

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:84%
about ancient cultures
at a nature center

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that I used to work
at, we would talk

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:45.150 align:middle line:84%
how an atlatl, a
spear-thrower, is a technology.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that
technologies are computers.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.490 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that we design
and make and use that changes

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.960 align:middle line:90%
our world.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I don't know why
this is kind of flipping

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:57.388 align:middle line:90%
into my head right now.

00:41:57.388 --> 00:41:58.890 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thinking
about here we look

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:02.580 align:middle line:84%
at something like eBay
or Amazon or something

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.070 align:middle line:84%
that was to allow the average
person to get together

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.850 align:middle line:84%
with another person and sell
their goods directly and so

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:08.650 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And now you have
incredible levels

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:14.370 align:middle line:84%
of sabotage and
competition and people

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.010 align:middle line:84%
scanning for sales
in a warehouse,

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.170 align:middle line:84%
buying up the
inventory, putting it

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.990 align:middle line:84%
on Amazon to sell for
a few dollar markup,

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and then knocking
out their competition

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:28.110 align:middle line:84%
by arranging for bad reviews
on their product and so forth.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.970 align:middle line:90%
It's like everything.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It comes down to this
whole notion, as you were

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.020 align:middle line:90%
talking about, of competition.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.960 align:middle line:84%
At what point do we start
looking at cooperation

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.760 align:middle line:90%
as our model for living?

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, everybody wants to
have their share of the pie.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:44.640 align:middle line:84%
But do you have to have it
over every other person that's

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.760 align:middle line:90%
offering a similar thing?

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How do we work
that out in our minds?

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.345 align:middle line:84%
How would you teach
this in high school?

00:42:51.345 --> 00:42:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, as far as solving
something like that short term

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:59.350 align:middle line:84%
with something as complex as
Google or Amazon, et cetera,

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:00.150 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to say.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But there are some basic
tenets I think we could follow,

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and that is that we can't keep
speeding up-- that's one--

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and that we do have to
have balance and separation

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:90%
of powers, if you will.

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And so if it was up to
me, I would start teaching

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.610 align:middle line:84%
in first grade, let alone
into high school, the idea

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.695 align:middle line:90%
of the negative feedback loop.

00:43:22.695 --> 00:43:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Talk about that.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: And the negative
feedback loop is how any system

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:30.220 align:middle line:84%
works, whether it's our
body or a mechanical system.

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:33.420 align:middle line:84%
It's where if you go too
far in one direction,

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.630 align:middle line:84%
you're drawn back
towards a healthy center.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And then if you go
back the other way,

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.620 align:middle line:84%
then you're drawn back
towards that healthy center.

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:84%
A most familiar example would
be a thermostat, of course.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But in our own bodies,
say, our blood sugar

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.630 align:middle line:84%
is regulated throughout the day
by our body sensing blood sugar

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.240 align:middle line:84%
levels and kicking insulin
in and then stopping

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.520 align:middle line:84%
the production of
insulin, et cetera.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And when and if that negative
feedback loop breaks down,

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:90%
we're diseased.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.800 align:middle line:90%
We have diabetes.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And if we understood that that
is the way everything works,

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:10.230 align:middle line:84%
then we could design systems
that don't go too fast

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and don't consume too
much, et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the points
of optimism I have

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.080 align:middle line:84%
for being able to talk
to each other about this

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:23.070 align:middle line:84%
is one time having seen in a
biology textbook the yin yang

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:27.610 align:middle line:84%
symbol juxtaposed right next
to a negative feedback loop.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:31.795 align:middle line:84%
And it struck me that, yes,
these two are the same things,

00:44:31.795 --> 00:44:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that they're the idea of
living in a balance where

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.890 align:middle line:84%
you don't go too
far out on the ends

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.440 align:middle line:90%
and you restore to a center.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of wisdom there,

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
scientific reality

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.800 align:middle line:90%
there that we could build on.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I absolutely agree.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of human
consciousness, the notion

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.740 align:middle line:84%
of thriving without
it having to be

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:84%
at the expense of
either nature or one

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.920 align:middle line:84%
another is another
thing, I mean,

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that has to start being
inculcated into our thinking.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.270 align:middle line:90%
We can all thrive.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
rich, complex world.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:09.240 align:middle line:84%
All of us have such interesting
areas of genius and talents

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.640 align:middle line:84%
that we want to bring
forward, that there really

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.600 align:middle line:84%
is room for everybody in
an organic-rich society.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it's being
kind of whittled down

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to just a few positions that
you can train for in college.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And so to encourage that
richness, that unique divine

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:28.180 align:middle line:84%
genius in each individual
expressing itself,

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.460 align:middle line:84%
just the joy of that
expression hopefully

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.070 align:middle line:84%
can start supplanting
the need to win

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.348 align:middle line:90%
at the expense of someone else.

00:45:35.348 --> 00:45:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: And I do think
that that winning aspect,

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.510 align:middle line:84%
that that competitive aspect
is not only a part of nature

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:84%
overall, but it's a part
of our human nature,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.640 align:middle line:84%
but that we can't see
it as the only thing.

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if we also
see that part of our thriving

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.840 align:middle line:90%
is a drawing back, as well--

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.680 align:middle line:84%
we are awake during the
day, and then we sleep,

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and we eat, and then we have
had enough, and we stop eating.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the joy
in that comes from, not

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.000 align:middle line:84%
from continuing
to stuff yourself.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: So if we can get
in the mindset that thriving

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:12.430 align:middle line:84%
in our culture means that we
might have all sorts of nice

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.600 align:middle line:84%
things and consume
to a certain point,

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.700 align:middle line:84%
but there is a point beyond
which we as both individuals

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and a society, somehow as
we work things out together,

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:24.130 align:middle line:90%
have to draw back from that.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:28.212 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, that's my
kind of hope for--

00:46:28.212 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's my hope, too.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:33.898 align:middle line:84%
And the notion of
competition, I don't think

00:46:33.898 --> 00:46:36.190 align:middle line:84%
there's anything wrong with
kind of healthy competition

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that's in this kind of good
sported way between people.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
we're talking about here.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Our culture has gone
a different way,

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's that kind
of winning over

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.370 align:middle line:84%
someone versus just
doing your very best

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and thriving that
I'm talking about.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.000 align:middle line:90%
And I think you are, as well.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit ago, you said--
this isn't an esoteric concept

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.740 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about,
but I'm going to take it

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.157 align:middle line:90%
into an esoteric arena.

00:46:58.157 --> 00:46:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
comfortable with it,

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.740 align:middle line:84%
just say, hey, not
my wheelhouse, OK?

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's been said by some
of the fairly well-known,

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:11.200 align:middle line:84%
more spiritual guides and so
forth that the changes that are

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:90%
happening on Earth--

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.740 align:middle line:84%
remember everything around
the turn of the century?

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.170 align:middle line:84%
We were going to go through
a polarity shift, and life

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:19.210 align:middle line:84%
as we knew it would
be over and so forth.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.430 align:middle line:90%
That hasn't happened.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Earth does go
through pole shifts.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.380 align:middle line:90%
It will happen sooner or later.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But I remember in
one session from--

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.940 align:middle line:84%
this is more intuitive
or soul group guidance.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.180 align:middle line:10%
They said, much of
what was forecast

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.940 align:middle line:10%
by Edgar Cayce and
people such as him, Ruth

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.790 align:middle line:10%
Montgomery and others,
those channels,

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.280 align:middle line:10%
to happen on this Earth in
terms of the Earth changes

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.800 align:middle line:10%
and where they would
occur would actually not

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.250 align:middle line:10%
occur as a result of the
shift of the consciousness

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:51.230 align:middle line:10%
of the people on that land.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So what does that mean
to you, if anything?

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Well, the particular
prophecies and how things are

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.230 align:middle line:84%
going to shift I'm
not as familiar with.

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:01.790 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
things can change

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:04.780 align:middle line:84%
if our consciousness changes
I resonate with greatly.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:07.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've been
talking about here mostly,

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I guess, if that was
the outlook of all of us

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.672 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have to be
stuck in these mental ruts,

00:48:13.672 --> 00:48:15.130 align:middle line:84%
no matter who we
are, whether we're

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:18.490 align:middle line:84%
on the left, the right, the
scientific, the spiritual,

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and work our best to find
common understanding.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.240 align:middle line:84%
We still might end
up disagreeing,

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.760 align:middle line:84%
but at least it'd be better
to have a common understanding

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.670 align:middle line:90%
about what we disagree about.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.770 align:middle line:84%
What could that
consciousness change be?

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's almost precisely
what we've talked about

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.770 align:middle line:84%
so far, that we don't have to
always live in the same way

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:39.850 align:middle line:90%
that we live.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:42.233 align:middle line:90%
That alone could go miles.

00:48:42.233 --> 00:48:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: And then it does
become more complex beyond that.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:51.250 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we have many
multiple emotional things

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:55.690 align:middle line:84%
in our human existence that make
it not a black and white issue.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But that further
implies that we have

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.790 align:middle line:84%
to talk to each other
about those things

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:04.230 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't go off the deep
end in one way or the other.

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, that
matter of our culture

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.390 align:middle line:90%
becoming overly competitive--

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:11.860 align:middle line:90%
I do believe that's the case.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if you go just
about anywhere in the country

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and you talk to people
about how they are raised

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and their own
values and so forth,

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.100 align:middle line:84%
that you'd still find a lot
of cooperative understanding,

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.250 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So even very conservative
traditional cultures

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.640 align:middle line:84%
are going to have in it
caring for one another

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and the golden rule firmly
in their consciousness.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:38.053 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's mostly when you
get to the subject of economics

00:49:38.053 --> 00:49:39.220 align:middle line:90%
where it's really afflicted.

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And there it seems like we
have no mechanisms by which we

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.710 align:middle line:84%
can say, can we work
this out without fighting

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:48.697 align:middle line:90%
over the goodies?

00:49:48.697 --> 00:49:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So do you think we
have to say goodbye to the day

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:55.480 align:middle line:90%
of the 3,000-mile Caesar salad?

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Oh, the
3,000-miles Caesar salad.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that would be a great
thing to work our way back

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.670 align:middle line:90%
to much more local food.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:04.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, definitely.

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And right now, it'd be very
difficult to do it overnight,

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.770 align:middle line:84%
especially, say,
here in Colorado

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:14.860 align:middle line:84%
where I think the figure is
that we only eat 4% of our food

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.020 align:middle line:90%
here comes from Colorado.

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're a long
ways from creating

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:23.100 align:middle line:84%
a food system that would feed
us here, even in Boulder County.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Part of that is
recognizing that we live

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:27.390 align:middle line:90%
in a really arid environment.

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we'd have
to maybe not expect

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to have so much
food created there.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But the other one would
be developing mechanisms

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.480 align:middle line:84%
by which we can produce a
healthy, sustainable food here,

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.280 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What, also,
about the notion of grazing?

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Just we only have a
few minutes left--

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.760 align:middle line:84%
kind of looking
into that subject

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:48.810 align:middle line:84%
because you have every kind of
argument and counterargument

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.070 align:middle line:90%
and such coming out about it.

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:53.190 align:middle line:84%
What is your position on
grazing and ultimately

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:55.500 align:middle line:84%
where we have to go
with our food sources

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.590 align:middle line:84%
out of concern for
our interrelationship

00:50:58.590 --> 00:50:59.460 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth?

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Grazing in terms of--

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Cattle grazing--

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: --meat production.

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --for meat
industries and such,

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.480 align:middle line:84%
without getting political
about it because every body is

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.022 align:middle line:84%
different and needs
different things.

00:51:08.022 --> 00:51:08.822 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:51:08.822 --> 00:51:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, my sense on the
idea of animal agriculture

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:16.310 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to a lot of
what we've been talking about.

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:18.120 align:middle line:84%
A, let's talk to each
other and figure out

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.578 align:middle line:84%
the best ways of doing things
and not fight with each other

00:51:20.578 --> 00:51:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and leave all the solutions
left at the wayside.

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And right now, my own
personal read on it

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.460 align:middle line:84%
is that we can't eat
meat at the level

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.460 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing it now
across the Earth and more

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and more meat because
it just won't work.

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going to despoil the
land upon which we depend.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.260 align:middle line:84%
However, it doesn't
mean necessarily

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.620 align:middle line:90%
that we can't eat any meat.

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And also, we should remember
that the grazing of ungulates

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:51.930 align:middle line:84%
was and is a part of the
land all across our world

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and that if you biomimic the
way that wild ungulates live

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.320 align:middle line:84%
that you can, in fact, improve
soil quality in an area

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.420 align:middle line:84%
if we don't expect
too much from it.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So we can produce some meat for
people, probably plenty of meat

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:12.390 align:middle line:84%
for people, and still improve
the quality of the land

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:13.860 align:middle line:90%
there if we do it right.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But that won't work if we expect
more and more and more steaks

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.150 align:middle line:90%
and hamburgers.

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very
rational answer to that.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And do you believe
that there is a place,

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.410 align:middle line:84%
again, more on almost a
psycho-spiritual level,

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:32.040 align:middle line:84%
for real communication between
communion between ourselves

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and nature, real
clarity of communion?

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.160 align:middle line:84%
What do you see as the
importance of that in society,

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.460 align:middle line:90%
now, reintroducing that?

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Yeah.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I do think it's
possible for us to have

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:44.160 align:middle line:90%
a communion with nature.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And in my own mind,
that's a recognition

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are nature, that
we came out of this Earth,

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and that we're a seamless
part of Earth as a whole.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that,
when we recognize

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that we can be in nature
when we're inside,

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.830 align:middle line:84%
but we can also be
outside more to be

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:08.930 align:middle line:84%
in contact with those forces and
situations that we grew up in.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors probably spent 95%
of their waking hours outside.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we could benefit
from that kind of situation.

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But we can do so by
letting our minds

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.880 align:middle line:84%
be open to lots of different
ways of connecting,

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.060 align:middle line:84%
which would include a rational
thought about things, which

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:35.790 align:middle line:84%
would include a non-rational
contemplation about life,

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:37.290 align:middle line:90%
a mix of the two.

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Slowing down, I think,
is a part of it.

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a big one for
you is just slow the heck down.

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:42.477 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: That slowing down--

00:53:42.477 --> 00:53:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I think we're way off the charts
in terms of our pace of life.

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So we can't even consider
how to do any of the above.

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And one of the things
that's been proven in brain

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.670 align:middle line:84%
science is the
role of gratitude.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Does that have any
resonance for what you're

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:00.490 align:middle line:90%
saying in this whole matrix?

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>> OGLE: Boy, that has a lot
of resonance for me in both,

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I guess you might call,
rational and non-rational ways.

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:14.150 align:middle line:84%
First, just expressing gratitude
changes our way of being.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.770 align:middle line:84%
It puts us in a
different mindset.

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:19.320 align:middle line:10%
And there's a woman named
Janine Benyus who came up

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.260 align:middle line:10%
with the term
"biomimicry," and it's

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.950 align:middle line:10%
become quite big these days.

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what we
talk about in biomimicry

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.790 align:middle line:84%
is how to produce a
process or a product

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:32.670 align:middle line:84%
based on looking at
something in nature.

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:35.640 align:middle line:10%
But when she was
asked one time how

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.450 align:middle line:10%
we could show self-restraint
in human life, what

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:42.150 align:middle line:10%
is the biomimetic way
that we would do that,

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:46.740 align:middle line:10%
her answer was by showing
thanks and gratitude.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:52.050 align:middle line:84%
She said it was our
human way of becoming

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:56.348 align:middle line:84%
more attuned to the
cycles of life around us.

00:54:56.348 --> 00:54:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think
that's a perfect answer,

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and we're out of time, and
we couldn't have ended it any

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:01.350 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:03.017 align:middle line:84%
Martin, thank you so
much for your work,

00:55:03.017 --> 00:55:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and I do hope that
we can slow down,

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.700 align:middle line:84%
we can begin talking to
each other, both rationally

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and in terms of the magic of
what we can create together.

00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:14.910 align:middle line:84%
As you said, this has to
be a co-creative process.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And so for mothers and
fathers, it's up to us

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.710 align:middle line:84%
to start teaching our
children these principles

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.430 align:middle line:90%
from the time they can talk.

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OGLE: Right.

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:24.390 align:middle line:84%
