>>REGINA MEREDITH: They
call her a modern day hidden

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.540 align:middle line:10%
figure, the true story
of women of color who

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:10%
were key figures behind
NASA's early space missions.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Olympia LePoint experienced
repeated childhood trauma,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:84%
which drove her to
academics as an escape,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:84%
becoming an award-winning
rocket scientist.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
When memories of abuse surfaced
later in life, however,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.570 align:middle line:84%
she knew the time had come
to deconstruct her life

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:90%
and her brain function.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
This led her to her current
work, "Answers Unleashed--

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
The Science of Unleashing
Your Brain's Power."

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited to have you here.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
You're just
absolutely delightful.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.645 align:middle line:90%
And wow, what a story.

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what more
can happen to a woman

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
than what happened
to you in life?

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Not a laughing matter,
but you've overcome it.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So I guess we can have
a little levity in it.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Aside from the incredible
work that you're

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:84%
doing in helping people really
learn how to use total brain

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:84%
function in a
useful, everyday way,

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:84%
your personal story
is so inspirational.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Just like the movie "Hidden
Figures" was inspirational--

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I loved it; I saw
it a few times--

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.145 align:middle line:84%
in its own way, what these
women had to go through--

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OLYMPIA LEPOINT: Oh, yes.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To be
in this position.

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, yes.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it didn't
change all that much.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: No, and it
didn't change in my life.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you're young.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So it hasn't changed all
that much, it's fair to say.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one of the
things that was intriguing,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
that we'll get into
as a little back story

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
before we go into
your personal story,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and then get into
the science of it,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:84%
is that when you ended
up-- once you were an adult

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.515 align:middle line:84%
and you had all your
accolades and you

00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:48.056 align:middle line:84%
were working with
rocket scientists--

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:52.096 align:middle line:84%
and they have to have your
sign-off before a test, right?

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
able to observe genius

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.317 align:middle line:84%
at a level most
people never see.

00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, yeah.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we think nerdy
little guys with clipboards,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what we think
of when we think

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
of geniuses behind the
space aeronautics industry,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about not only what

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:84%
you observed-- you ultimately
had to develop that

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:90%
within yourself.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, Yes.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I remember the first day
working at this rocket science

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:10%
company.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.840 align:middle line:10%
And I remember walking down
the hallway and looking around,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.820 align:middle line:10%
and there were very few women.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked around and
there were very few people

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
of color, on top of
the need to execute

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
in an environment with
that technical side.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember looking
in this environment

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and feeling scared at first.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Feeling
completely scared.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A stranger
in a strange land.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.776 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And I thought,
how am I going to do this?

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been trained
in mathematics.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been trained to do this
math on this high level.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.229 align:middle line:84%
But I remember being
first, just intimidated.

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't quite sure
if I could do it.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And I found myself
working with brilliant men.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just
studying them, and studying

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:84%
how they were looking
at situations,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and how they were
breaking apart scenarios,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and just sitting down
with them and asking them

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:84%
about how did they come
up with this design

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.410 align:middle line:90%
and what did they look at?

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of doing that,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there's
different type of geniuses.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Not
everyone thinks alike.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has their unique
way that they see the world

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:90%
and they process information.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And when they're able to use
the way in which they are born

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.024 align:middle line:84%
to use, and they
create things with it,

00:03:42.024 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that's how they
show their genius.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And I saw all different
types of geniuses.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I saw people who could look
at data across a screen

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.929 align:middle line:84%
and be able to
know mathematically

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:90%
what was going to happen.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I saw individuals who could look
at reams and reams of welding

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.350 align:middle line:84%
data and know exactly
how the engine would

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:90%
fall apart and explode.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I was around this one
individual, Jeff was his name.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
He was a program manager of
this entire engineering group.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And he would have dreams
on the type of rockets

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:90%
that he could build.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
And his mission
was communicating

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to every single person in
his 200-person team of how

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
to build this rocket so
it was going to be safe.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And based on
a vision in a dream?

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Based on
his own intuition.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And it
was profound for me.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Here I was adding
to the situation.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I was learning.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was just so much--
so much that I didn't know.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.423 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And there's
still so much I don't know.

00:04:45.423 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like--
it was this ability

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to appreciate how people
think, and how we each have

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
this ability to unleash
a genius brain power,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.047 align:middle line:90%
no matter what we do.

00:04:59.047 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't feel
that, because humanity

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
has a general kind of
inferiority complex.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
We're just kind of raised
that way as a species.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.032 align:middle line:84%
One thing or another teaches
us that we're insufficient.

00:05:11.032 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
biggest ones for people,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest fears
for most people is math.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, gosh, oh, yeah.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you even
had issues with it

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.707 align:middle line:90%
at one time in your life, right?

00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, yeah.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:90%
It is amazing.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
People always think that
really smart people always

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.240 align:middle line:84%
have to ace mathematics, always
have to do well in school,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:90%
have to have a high GPA.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no, it's not.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Just personally,
I failed algebra.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:84%
I failed geometry,
calculus, and chemistry.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And I chuckle, because if we
use the current ways of how

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
we think intelligence is
supposed to look like,

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:84%
or smell like or feel like,
our traditional ways of looking

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
at intelligence, if
we limit it to that,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
we're not honoring ourselves
as humanitarians in a society.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Just looking at my
personal experience,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I failed all those classes.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And I had to retrain the
way that I was thinking.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I had to see the
world differently.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And I recognize, in those
situations I had fear.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I had such a fear
about succeeding.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And this was-- I
failed in eighth grade.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:90%
I failed in high school.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And even, I think, one or
two classes in university.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was like each
time, I had to reanalyze

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
how I was seeing myself
in regards to what

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:90%
I could do in the future.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I recognized that I

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
was the one holding myself back
because of my own thoughts--

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that was the time
where I realized

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:90%
I unleash my own brain power.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
is ubiquitous in society--

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
the suppression of
our own brain's power.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And going back to that, you're
watching all these genius men,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:84%
working their genius in
their own way, almost all--

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I assume-- genius
white men, right?

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's kind of
what the room looked like.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
it on studies of--

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
for example, there have been
studies of brain chemicals

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.810 align:middle line:90%
such as serotonin.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:84%
The highest levels of serotonin
en masse exist among white men.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.321 align:middle line:84%
Well, because society
has reinforced

00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that they were the ones that
would have the education,

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
be respected, have
the knowledge.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So the genius can
unleash itself,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:84%
it seems, in that population
at an earlier age--

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
a little more
readily accepted by

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:84%
society, family,
accepted by their peers.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:90%
But you come into the equation--

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Different.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.326 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally different.

00:07:45.326 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Totally different.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And being a scientist, I
recognize your science is only

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:90%
as good as your study.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Your science is only as
good as the population

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:90%
in which you're observing.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.247 align:middle line:84%
And so all these
other type of science

00:07:58.247 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:84%
that has been created
all in the past,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:84%
they've really just looked
at one type of group.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And so here
I am, a woman of color.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
At the time when I
entered rocket science,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:90%
it was back in 1998.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:90%
So that was 20 years ago.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.312 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thankful I
still look young.

00:08:14.312 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you do.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.080 align:middle line:90%
You look beautiful.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.414 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Thank you very much.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sexiest
rocket scientist ever.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, thank you.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Coming from you-- thank you.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating,
because as I

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:84%
went through this
type of scenario

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and was in this environment,
the people that encouraged me

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
the most to move forward were
not as many as the engineers

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
that you would
think of, although I

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.520 align:middle line:84%
had great mentors in
engineers and male leaders

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:90%
who were guiding me.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very thankful for that.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.615 align:middle line:90%
The women were the ones--

00:08:48.615 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
was an interesting--

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Who got to me.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --part of your book.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah, the women.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I remember the second day that
I was working, this man came up.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:90%
And he circled around me.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.222 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking to myself,

00:09:00.222 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:90%
why is he circling around me?

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:90%
I looked down.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had-- like, I
had something in my clothes,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
or maybe had tissue
stuck to my heel.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.752 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you
looked like you.

00:09:07.752 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And he circled
around me, didn't say anything.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:90%
And then he walked off.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And just the caveat
to the story--

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
he later became one of my
biggest supporters and mentors

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:90%
later on.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was such a wonderful
help to me as time went on.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't understand that.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand the
type of dynamics-- the fact

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:84%
that I was a person completely
different in that environment.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking at me
like a museum piece, almost.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, a
couple of seconds later,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:90%
there was these three women.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And they came over to me,
and they says, come with us

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.447 align:middle line:90%
over into the restroom.

00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even know
who these women were.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.191 align:middle line:84%
This was my second
day on the job.

00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And they pulled me
over into the restroom.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.152 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
don't know who we are.

00:09:50.152 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But we're excited
that you're here.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
We have not seen another
engineer, a female engineer

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:90%
on this floor for 15 years.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:90%
And we're excited.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And we just want to
tell you who we are.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
We're the-- at the time
they called themselves

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:84%
secretaries, that's what
they called themselves.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Now the official term is
administrative assistants.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:90%
But they said, we're here.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And there will be times
in which you'll be tested.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be tested.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.780 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
men push your buttons.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.686 align:middle line:90%
This is not all men.

00:10:22.686 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:84%
But there are some men that
will push your buttons.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It will be your job to maintain
your cool and calmness.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And don't cry.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: And don't cry.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:90%
And don't cry.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And those words, the second
day of my time there,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
was the best mental
advice I could

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
have received in my almost
decade working as a rocket

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:90%
scientist.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, a
couple of months later--

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:90%
bam!

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I was in a meeting.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.375 align:middle line:90%
And here I was--

00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:90%
I was so emotional inside.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:90%
But I had to stay calm.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that my job was
explaining something complex

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
so people could understand
the importance of it,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and so they wouldn't necessarily
look at who was giving it,

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
but rather, appreciate it for
the information that it was.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And so you were able
to withstand that.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:90%
But it started before that.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:90%
It even started in school.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And you ended up--

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you ended up graduating
way up there in your studies,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:90%
in mathematics.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Was it like number five or
six out of 6,500 or something?

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: You have a really--

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.056 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
huge, huge accolades.

00:11:27.056 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Thank you.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.557 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: I graduated
at the top of the class

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
from California State
University, Northridge

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:90%
in applied mathematics.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just have
such respect for that,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
because you found a way
around the way your brain had

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:84%
been functioning because of the
fear that was in your being.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Whereas I had a little
different attitude.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I thought, algebra--
what do I need this for?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:90%
So I just doodled.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And I designed
clothing during class,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and was perfectly happy when
the teacher gave me a D minus,

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:84%
saying, I've only
given you a D minus

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:90%
so I don't see your face again.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh!

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no!

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I said,
well, that worked.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.463 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:12:05.463 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, no!

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He didn't fail me.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was because I couldn't--
no one explained to me

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:84%
the rationale behind why I
needed this for my everyday

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:90%
No one explained anything.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was put out in
such an uninteresting

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:84%
way, which happens to
a lot of smart people.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.803 align:middle line:84%
They're just like,
what's the point in this?

00:12:24.803 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, if I can't see
the usefulness I'll probably

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:90%
fail it anyway.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So I might as well just design
my little summer outfit here

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.039 align:middle line:90%
during class.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: You bring
up an excellent point.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
What I recognize about my
own experience, as well

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
as even listening to
your experience too,

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I've recognized that really,
really genius people usually

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:84%
fail often, because they use an
intuitive side to their brain--

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: In addition
to the book knowledge.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:90%
And that was true for me.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I recognized that I
had a logical side.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.960 align:middle line:84%
But I also had an
intuitive side.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And I really do feel that there
is a lot of children in school

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
systems that are being
labeled as special needs

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
or are needing
additional assistance,

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.306 align:middle line:84%
but really they are
geniuses in disguise.

00:13:11.306 --> 00:13:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And I'm a true
believer that an intuitive

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:90%
mind--

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Einstein was also a believer
of this, Albert Einstein.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
An intuitive mind
is a form of genius.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.879 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to discount
that, when that's

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.700 align:middle line:84%
where almost all
breakthroughs-- in science

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
included-- have come
from is at the detriment

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:90%
of all progress on this planet.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yes.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I was working
with the engineers

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and I would see their mind,
and I'd see them see something

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
before it even existed,
I realized the intuition

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:84%
that the scientists used
was their inventive power.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's the ability to be
able to see a future before it

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:84%
exists, and make the commitment
to bring it into existence.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And it's not
just done in science.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It is done in our
personal lives.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:90%
It is done in education.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.340 align:middle line:84%
It is done in every
single way that we

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
believe that we can make a
difference in this world.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.924 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi said, you
must be the change

00:14:19.924 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that you wish to
see in the world.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.333 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: In order
to be that change,

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
you have to pick
the future which

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
is going to be beneficial for
yourself and other people,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and actually create it.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
have to live into it.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Create it.

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.153 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, just so people
understand what you were doing

00:14:35.153 --> 00:14:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and what you had created,
I'll read this here.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So your job was to calculate the
odds of catastrophic explosion,

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yes.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a serious--

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.572 align:middle line:90%
that's a serious responsibility.

00:14:45.572 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yes, it was.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it was.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, there would be
nights I'd be up, thinking--

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:90%
this is me, personally--

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.670 align:middle line:84%
God, please let
everything be safe.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I would sign off on
these engine tests.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't sign off
unless a person in my role--

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:84%
which was system safety
and reliability--

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:84%
authorized that every
single thing in that test

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:84%
was not going to cause
a loss of a human life.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
everyone else's work?

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Everyone else
had their own specific job.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.717 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And my job at
the time was to look at--

00:15:22.717 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Analyze all that data.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Everything would be
compiled and combined together

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to unleash a power
of the engine.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: And then I realized--

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:84%
later on, when I
left rocket science--

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.150 align:middle line:90%
life is the same way.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:84%
It's putting all
the pieces together

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
to not only unleash
a power in something

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.686 align:middle line:84%
that we build, but is to
unleash a power of our life.

00:15:49.686 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And you had to build it from
a really tough place, which

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:84%
is now coming up to
that part of the story.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.314 align:middle line:84%
For you, your childhood
was very traumatic.

00:16:02.314 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same time,
certain things were recognized.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:90%
You were always intuitive.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You came
prepackaged that way.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:84%
You had certain abilities
that were recognized.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:90%
And you were even put in--

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
well, through a
horrible circumstance--

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:84%
in a school for more
gifted students.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But let's get back
to your life itself.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:90%
It was rough.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go back to
probably the event that

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
changed your life, and
shut you down on one hand

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.942 align:middle line:84%
and open you up on
the other, which is--

00:16:31.942 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and I want to talk
about it a little bit,

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:90%
because it's ubiquitous.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
essentially molestation

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:90%
of children, rape, and so forth.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And you were eight years old
when this happened to you.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It was by your
mother's boyfriend,

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.264 align:middle line:90%
or who was it, again?

00:16:47.264 --> 00:16:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: It was actually
by a family friend.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.263 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A family friend.

00:16:50.263 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: A family
friend who I had trusted.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And in the middle
of the night, I was raped.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds horrible to say.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It's even more
horrible to remember.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, when you're
eight years old, yeah.

00:17:01.443 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: But what
happened to me personally

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
is that my brain
literally [CLICKING SOUND]

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:84%
locked it, shut it down, and
erased the memory until decades

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.100 align:middle line:90%
later, when I could handle it.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.034 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And it
was very, very tough.

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was especially
really tough

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.917 align:middle line:84%
because just two years earlier
I had made the decision--

00:17:19.917 --> 00:17:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I was six years old.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had made the
decision that I was

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.511 align:middle line:90%
going to be a rocket scientist.

00:17:23.511 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:90%
I was like, yes, yes!

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going to this
Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.045 align:middle line:90%
seeing the rocket engines.

00:17:30.045 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:10%
>>LEPOINT: And that was the
exciting part of my life.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.620 align:middle line:10%
I grew up in poverty.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:90%
And we had absolutely no money.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:84%
We would chew on ice just
to trick ourselves to think

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:90%
that we were eating food.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, when
I was six years old,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I went to this field trip.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was like the
highlight of my life--

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
like, oh my god,
I could do this.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't realize that
I was a woman of color,

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:90%
and specifically a woman.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: When I
saw the other men,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
the pictures of men
launching rockets.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And fast forward two years
later, and I was raped.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And I can
smile and say that now.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't before.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Because what I recognize
is that through the process

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.630 align:middle line:84%
of me going through that,
removing that trauma

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:84%
from my consciousness, and
for me, removing the shame

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:84%
that I had regarding
what happened--

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:90%
it had nothing to do with me.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:42.680 align:middle line:84%
But it had to do with
me taking my power back.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.549 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And it
was taking my power

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:84%
back in the way of not only
the way I saw myself as a woman

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:84%
in the world, but it
is what I could do

00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and what I could see for myself,
independent of anything that

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:90%
happened in the past.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And I speak about
this so passionately.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It is because-- and you and
I were talking about this

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:90%
earlier--

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
it's that so many
women, and men, have

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:84%
gone through situations
where they have been raped

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:84%
or where they have
been molested.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is
that shuts down the brain.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And I can speak from
authority from this,

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
happened with me.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I did in my
life is that I erased it.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And the way I handled it-- or
thought I was handling it--

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:90%
was placing myself in science.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Because
science was the way-- oh,

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to look
at anything emotionally.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I could just look at
everything as facts.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:90%
And I could solve that.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And that brought confidence.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And that connected my brain
on many different levels.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I
had to connect my brain

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:84%
on an emotional and
spiritual level, in which

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:90%
the science solely couldn't do.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And
for me personally,

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:10.260 align:middle line:84%
when I learned to remove
the shame and the stigma--

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.959 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which the women, or
boys, or girls are left with.

00:20:12.959 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Are left with.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: That
opened up my mind.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:84%
That opened up my brain,
where I realized, huh,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:90%
it's OK to be a woman.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to be a woman
launching rockets.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to be a woman
who dresses like a woman.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:90%
It is OK to be feminine.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:90%
It is OK to be myself.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily have to
fit in any mold of anyone--

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
how they think I should fit,
because of an experience

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
where someone puts you in a
certain place in which you

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.039 align:middle line:84%
were never belonging
in the first place.

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know-- and
I said it initially-- this

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:90%
is ubiquitous.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And about 20 years ago,
I started hearing things.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:84%
You know how things
happen in batches, so

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
to speak, a certain phenomena
comes to your awareness

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
all at once, and from
a lot of sources,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
just because it's
time to be made aware.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was made aware
that most of my friends

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:84%
had been molested, or even
raped in their childhood--

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:90%
most of them.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.663 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are all women who
are doing really well in life,

00:21:14.663 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:90%
you know, went on.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And even my own
mother, by her uncle.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what is--

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:84%
do I just know a
peculiar group of people?

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And then as the years
went on-- my husband

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:90%
teaches at university.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And he teaches an emotions
and motivation class.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And literally, something in the
neighborhood-- averaging around

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.272 align:middle line:84%
40% of the students, who are
mostly female, in the class

00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:42.230 align:middle line:90%
have been through this.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Mm-hmm.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the same thing
of boys, in elite schools,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:90%
at church, military.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:10%
It's almost as though it
is institutionalized, even,

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:56.750 align:middle line:10%
on some levels.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's some fracture
in our human character

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
that would allow this
to be perpetuated

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:90%
upon the young, the innocent.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But look, if you have
that percentage of people

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
that have been damaged at
a young age in this way,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.530 align:middle line:84%
look at all that brain power
that's just been shut down.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to stand up
and protest against what

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:90%
they don't want, right?

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Well, it's shocking
and inspiring at the same time.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And let me break
it down like this.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
The Centers for Disease
Control did a study.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's just estimated
out of the reports

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that one out of five
women have been sexually

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.839 align:middle line:90%
assaulted or raped or molested.

00:22:37.839 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the ones
that have been reported.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Well that's-- you know
that's not even close.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.204 align:middle line:84%
Probably closer to
two out of five.

00:22:44.204 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And we know that that's
only of what's reported.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And in every
single type of case

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
that someone has gone through,
there is this type of shame.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Can they speak up?

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Can they feel that they
can trust themselves again?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:84%
What happens-- and I can speak
about this as my own case.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:10%
When I realized that I
had to remove that trauma,

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.360 align:middle line:10%
about how I saw myself
in the world as a woman,

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.460 align:middle line:10%
and being able to
do great things,

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:10%
from rocket science to writing
books to doing TED lectures,

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:10%
I realized that I had
been given a gift.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:90%
I know that sounds really odd.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.906 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I understand
what you're saying.

00:23:31.906 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you had
to crack the code.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Through
that type of incident,

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn how to
powerfully trust myself.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And in learning how
to trust myself,

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I had to build up my
brain power to see

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
situations not only logically,
not only emotionally,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.150 align:middle line:84%
but in a way that actually
was a healthy emotional way,

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:90%
and a spiritual way.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had to combine
it in a way that

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
would allow me to see a
situation as the way it

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be for
where I was supposed to go.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I went through
that type of situation,

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I recognize that that
trauma introduced a power.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It was such a power
that if I could

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
take the power that
that situation brought

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and actually shift
it so it could

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:84%
be used in a way that was
going to be beneficial,

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:90%
anything was possible.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is
the nature of your work,

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.174 align:middle line:84%
is unleashing the
power of trauma.

00:24:33.174 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then shifting it.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.085 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And unleashing
the power of chaotic trauma.

00:24:39.085 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Chaotic
trauma and chaos.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an interesting
kind of chaos theory.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so this happened.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And then not too
long after that,

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
when you were still
quite young, you

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84%
got in a playground
kerfuffle with someone

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:90%
who took a ring and just--

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah, it was even
worse than the playground.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where was it, again?

00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: It was
in a classroom!

00:24:59.805 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, in the classroom.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he raked your face
with this sharp pointed object,

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.804 align:middle line:90%
and ripped your skin open.

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:06.603 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:25:06.603 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I shared about this
in my TED Talk.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:12.386 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first time ever--

00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:15.570 align:middle line:84%
the TED talk is "Reprogramming
Your Brain to Overcome Fear."

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
time ever, ever in my life,

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I chose to share about a
trauma that I experienced.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And I have so many.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: I literally
wrote the book on this.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
go through a few more,

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
because your life was
nothing but trauma, honestly.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.738 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: It was
very much trauma.

00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I recognize that
trauma is power.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that sounds really odd.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.045 align:middle line:84%
But it's the way that we take
it and change our life with it.

00:25:40.045 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, your
life shifted after that.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: It did.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:10%
To give a background
to the story,

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.340 align:middle line:10%
we lived in South
Central Los Angeles.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:10%
And at the time--

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:10%
it was in the 1980s, when the
crack epidemic was the highest.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And the gangs used to
recruit young people

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.530 align:middle line:84%
to go into the gangs
and do their drug runs.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was this boy that
was placed into our classroom.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was just an
innocent 10-year-old boy

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:90%
that didn't know any better.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was taught to
file down his ring

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:90%
so it acted like a knife.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So if he couldn't bring
any weapon to school,

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
or knife to school, he
had a ring on his finger

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:90%
that passed all the security.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:90%
But it was actually a weapon.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And he and I got
into an argument,

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:84%
because I always
had a smart mouth.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:90%
I always have power with words.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Now I know how to use
my words wisely now.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So he and I got
into an argument.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And then he sliced my face
open, and ripped my face open.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.321 align:middle line:90%
I almost--

00:26:43.321 --> 00:26:44.778 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And almost
lost your eye.

00:26:44.778 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: I almost lost my eye.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:50.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was-- the surgeon--

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.105 align:middle line:84%
of all that kind of
right after that,

00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember being brought
to the nurse's room.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And then there's hours
of gap in my memory.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.850 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing I remember
is laying on this bed.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And the surgeon was
sewing up my eye.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that he was
going to sew my face up

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.432 align:middle line:84%
so well that once I was
on TV in the future,

00:27:10.432 --> 00:27:11.890 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be
able to see a line.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.360 align:middle line:90%
I love that line in the book.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.470 align:middle line:90%
And you can't see a line.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: No, you
can't even see a line.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can't see it at all.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.880 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:90%
He was good.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.386 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: He sure was.

00:27:20.386 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And in
that moment in time,

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.759 align:middle line:84%
instead of me looking at my
face as being ripped open,

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:28.300 align:middle line:84%
at that moment in
time-- and I didn't

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:90%
recognize what I was doing.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about this
in the book, about--

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
you take those fractal
moments, that decision.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment in time,
I made the decision-- ah,

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.975 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be on TV.

00:27:38.975 --> 00:27:39.865 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:39.865 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And here you are.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And you have been already a lot.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:42.436 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Thank you.

00:27:42.436 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that was a moment--

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:84%
then you ended up in a
different kind of school--

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes. after that.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So you ended up in
a magnet school--

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, yeah.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A wonderful kind
of artsy magnet school, yeah.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.747 align:middle line:84%
My mother-- sure was
horrified, obviously.

00:27:55.747 --> 00:27:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Any mother would be.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:56.985 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of what happened.

00:27:56.985 --> 00:27:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Of what happened.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you also
had it in your neighborhood.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.342 align:middle line:84%
You had it in your backyard--
people doing crack at night

00:28:01.342 --> 00:28:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
There was-- it
was just horrible.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And my mother knew that--

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:84%
she didn't have an
education at the time.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But she knew that the only
way that she could help us

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:90%
is for us to get an education.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So she found a school
for me to go to.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:18.670 align:middle line:84%
She really did anything
and everything she could.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And she found this
school for me to go to.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And it required me to be
bused two hours to get

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:90%
there and two hours to be back.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And she says, this is the
only way I can do this.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And each trip, it was
a learning experience.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to the
school, it was like--

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.120 align:middle line:90%
these were like genius kids.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was smart.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.600 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't like they were.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.360 align:middle line:90%
They were brilliant.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remember looking
at them, just like I

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.130 align:middle line:90%
was looking at the scientists.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.690 align:middle line:90%
But I was--

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I must have been 10,
11, 12, that age.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:29:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just noticing
how their brains worked,

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:90%
how they communicated.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to a performing
arts school right afterwards.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And I learned performance,
and theater, and singing.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
People will be
completely shocked

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.940 align:middle line:90%
if they hear me singing opera.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh, we know this
woman is a rocket scientist.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was that
process of recognizing

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that I could express myself
intellectually, emotionally,

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and creatively, and
even spiritually.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.657 align:middle line:10%
And it was that growth,
of being able to be

00:29:33.657 --> 00:29:35.740 align:middle line:10%
in a different environment
and see something new--

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.960 align:middle line:90%
You were given the opportunity.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: And when we see--

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.580 align:middle line:84%
when we only see one
thing, when we only

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.820 align:middle line:84%
know one thing, when we are
never given the opportunity

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.520 align:middle line:84%
to see that another
reality exists,

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:84%
we are always constantly moving
towards something in which

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:90%
may not be our best interest.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: When someone
goes through trauma,

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.330 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that they
know is that trauma.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: But if they are
given an opportunity that exists

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:09.830 align:middle line:84%
where a life exists, where there
is not that type of trauma that

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:13.880 align:middle line:84%
exists, but actually peace
of mind and, a way for you

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to actually grow, and
OK to trust yourself,

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and OK to trust other
people, and OK to learn--

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:90%
that changes the brain.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And it opens
not only someone's mind up,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:90%
but their soul to move forward.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And what's so sad is at this
very minute in South Central

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:84%
LA, there are so
many geniuses that

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.010 align:middle line:84%
are just-- they
have like a bucket

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.512 align:middle line:84%
over their head because of
the limited possibility.

00:30:40.512 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: The only thing that
separates a gang member from

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.070 align:middle line:90%
a CEO--

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.260 align:middle line:10%
>>LEPOINT: Is that
the gang member

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:10%
didn't know that there's
processes and procedures

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.260 align:middle line:10%
that he can use the same
abilities and skills in

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:10%
to make billions of dollars.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: They're
each gifted people.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:90%
It's what are they exposed to.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.438 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And
that's the question.

00:31:05.438 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
society at large needs

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:90%
to recognize.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The whole game has to
change in that way.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Education has to change.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Education needs to be
stripped to its bones,

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate the way that you
understand trauma, the way you

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:84%
understand the way the brain
works, to start lighting up

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:84%
all of these unused brains that
are in areas that are simply

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.997 align:middle line:84%
economically just
disadvantaged on every level.

00:31:28.997 --> 00:31:30.455 align:middle line:84%
You know-- no
shortage of geniuses.

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Well, thank you.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.660 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for your show.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your
show specifically,

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.970 align:middle line:84%
because this is how we get
the information out there.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.490 align:middle line:84%
This is how all of your
viewers are knowing

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:90%
that they can help people.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.986 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:42.986 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: The youngest
child-- if there's anything

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.620 align:middle line:84%
that you can do, you can
find a child and mentor them.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And be
honest with yourself,

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:90%
and be honest with the child.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And let the person know that no
matter what type of experiences

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:84%
that they have gone
through, there's someone

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:84%
honest in their life who
is willing to show them

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.500 align:middle line:90%
a different life.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So they can choose that
life for themselves.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.468 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:32:07.468 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.550 align:middle line:84%
You were watching how
the brain functions

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:13.947 align:middle line:84%
when it goes into trauma
and collapse and freezes.

00:32:13.947 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And then when something
happens, where

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:84%
it opens its gates of
creativity and function up,

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:90%
then it freezes again.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So you were kind of diagramming
the processes of the brain

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.534 align:middle line:90%
through extended trauma.

00:32:25.534 --> 00:32:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And so speak a little bit about
that and what you learned,

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:90%
because you are a sponge.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:29.808 align:middle line:90%
You're always learning.

00:32:29.808 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:10%
>>LEPOINT: My book
that I just wrote--

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.740 align:middle line:10%
"Answers Unleashed"--
I share about trauma.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.730 align:middle line:10%
And I share these stories.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're like
traumatic stories.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.832 align:middle line:84%
But I also interject
what we learn--

00:32:44.832 --> 00:32:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And what I
learned specifically

00:32:46.805 --> 00:32:48.860 align:middle line:84%
from those stories,
where I share

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:84%
about the science of how I
overcame certain situations,

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and this new
science I'm applying

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:84%
from my own experience,
how my own brain reshaped.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And what trauma does is it turns
off our frontal brain lobes.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It freezes us up.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.505 align:middle line:90%
So take a simple example.

00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:10.880 align:middle line:10%
So if you're
studying mathematics

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.922 align:middle line:10%
and you don't know how
to do it, it's like--

00:33:12.922 --> 00:33:13.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Brain freeze.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.450 align:middle line:10%
>>LEPOINT: Brain freeze.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:15.910 align:middle line:10%
>>LEPOINT: And you're like, oh!

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.493 align:middle line:84%
And that was the reason
why I wrote my first book,

00:33:18.493 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:84%
"Mathaphobia," was
because there's

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:84%
so many kids freezing
their brain when

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.930 align:middle line:90%
they go to mathematics.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But then amplify
that 1,000 times.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we go through
a stressful situation,

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:84%
our brain freeze up
1,000 times more.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: And it's like-- ah!

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Paralyzing.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a couple
of different responses.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
writing this book,

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I was really
writing it because I

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:84%
wanted to understand
how I got through this.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And the science--
it was fascinating

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:56.030 align:middle line:84%
to me, because I didn't know
how I overcame these situations.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, how can I
explain this to somebody else

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.520 align:middle line:84%
so they can overcome
their situations too?

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that
I knew how to do it

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:90%
is to apply the math to it.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized is
that we have a brain flow.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.489 align:middle line:90%
It connects us.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Our frontal brain lobes connect
to our striatum in our brain.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And it also connects-- our
brain connects us to our body.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, our brain
connects us this outside world,

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.550 align:middle line:84%
this gigantic field
around us that we

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:90%
have this power to walk in.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the way you
put it-- after trauma,

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:34.340 align:middle line:84%
the brain can either go into
shut-down mode and freeze,

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:84%
or you can go to
rapid expansion mode.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But it really becomes a
matter of will and choice.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.639 align:middle line:84%
And talk about how this
complex works together now.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Well,
thank you so much.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I created a term
called the Triabrain.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:90%
It is a three-sided brain.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the left,
right, and center.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And the left side
is very logical,

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and what I've been
doing for years

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.230 align:middle line:84%
with the science and technology,
engineering and mathematics.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.710 align:middle line:84%
The right side's very
expressive-- the ability

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:04.495 align:middle line:84%
to public speak and to be
out there and share messages.

00:35:04.495 --> 00:35:06.437 align:middle line:84%
But going through my
mother's situation,

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and going through
all that, I realized

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that there was a faith side
of the brain, that will,

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that drive, that
part of you that

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.340 align:middle line:84%
comes out in the middle of
chaos, in the middle of trauma.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The divine
expression of self.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And that part is
embedded in the brain.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
important to note-- now,

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a psychologist.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a neuroscientist.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm Olympia LePoint,
who has gone

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:84%
through all these
types of experiences

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that there was a
way that my brain was working

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.280 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get through
these type of situations.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I couldn't
make sense of it.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
it was kind of like,

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:90%
how can I recreate this?

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:90%
How can I do that?

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And the way in which I
knew how to express things

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.730 align:middle line:90%
is through science.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:56.750 align:middle line:90%
I knew formulas.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.340 align:middle line:90%
I knew mathematical equations.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:84%
How could I represent what goes
on-- what went on in my brain

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.420 align:middle line:90%
in scientific terms?

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.070 align:middle line:90%
But not only that.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.220 align:middle line:84%
For all the other people
who relate to my story,

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.010 align:middle line:84%
how can I explain
it to them, too,

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.220 align:middle line:90%
so they could take this away?

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I created what the
Triabrain theory of relativity

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.800 align:middle line:90%
does.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually based
on Einstein's theory

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:90%
of relativity--

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:90%
E equals mc squared.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.260 align:middle line:84%
We've always seen that
in all of the science--

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.610 align:middle line:90%
all over, everywhere.

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein was a
person who truly believed

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:90%
in the power of intuition.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was something
which he knew existed.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And he wanted to prove it.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, I realized that the
Triabrain theory of relativity

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.790 align:middle line:84%
could be used to help
people understand

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:84%
how their thoughts
change the energy

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.500 align:middle line:90%
in these chaotic situations.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And it
goes like this.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:01.010 align:middle line:84%
The three-sided brain
is not only in our head.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.440 align:middle line:90%
It connects us to our body.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And the energy in
these connections

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.650 align:middle line:90%
creates a field around us.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And these fields
around us contain our thoughts.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Triabrain
theory of relativity

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.190 align:middle line:84%
says that each one
of my thoughts,

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.550 align:middle line:84%
each one of your thoughts, each
one of the audience thoughts--

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.810 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts are responsible
for converting energy

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:26.880 align:middle line:84%
in a situation to actually
be one of two forms.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: It will either be
detrimental to how we grow--

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Collapse.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: A collapse.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Or like the Northridge
earthquake, collapsing--

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, collapse.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Or for
innovation and growth.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.113 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Expansion.

00:37:40.113 --> 00:37:42.770 align:middle line:90%
We collapse and expand.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And we don't think of
our trauma in that way.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: No.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And what our trauma
does, oddly enough--

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
in my case, oddly
enough in my case,

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.850 align:middle line:84%
the trauma was
energy for me to use.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:38:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It was energy for me to use
to create a path, a trajectory

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:90%
towards rocket science.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: It was an energy
that was used as a trajectory

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.100 align:middle line:84%
to point me towards writing
the books, a trajectory

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:14.335 align:middle line:84%
towards creating different
things and products for people.

00:38:14.335 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we go any
further let me just kind

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.600 align:middle line:84%
of interrupt you,
because at this point,

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.150 align:middle line:84%
people are going to want to
know about how do we interface

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.390 align:middle line:84%
with old, what we
consider trapped trauma

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:30.740 align:middle line:84%
to re-release the power that
was there at that point?

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Well, I'm still
finding that out myself.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is something
in which scientists are actually

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.300 align:middle line:84%
going to be just
really growing from.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:43.310 align:middle line:84%
For me, what I had to do
in my own life is really

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:90%
go to the root of the trauma.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:49.970 align:middle line:84%
For me, there were things
that I'd erased in my brain.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And once I had those
flashbacks, once it came,

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be scared
of it anymore.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:57.290 align:middle line:90%
I had to address it.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, for example, being raped
at eight years old-- that

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.160 align:middle line:84%
would change the way that
I interacted with men.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:90%
And I had to balance that out.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I was both feminine as
well as intelligent.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
to pick either one.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I could walk in
being both people.

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:17.810 align:middle line:84%
But I had to learn
how to realize

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
that that event when I was eight
doesn't define my reality right

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.100 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And
for me personally,

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:25.560 align:middle line:90%
that's an ongoing thing.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.151 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Still-- I still have
stuff, I've got to go through.

00:39:29.151 --> 00:39:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: I think we all
do, because we're all human.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: In this
planet, we each

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:37.790 align:middle line:84%
have encountered a traumatic
situation that has reframed

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.260 align:middle line:90%
the way that we're thinking.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's not until we
actually have the strength

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and have the truthfulness
within ourselves to look--

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.880 align:middle line:84%
This is how I was
thinking before.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.090 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
change my beliefs now,

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.620 align:middle line:90%
to recognize that this is not--

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who I am.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Who I am.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and that's
really the key point.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:90%
If we all have this--

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:84%
as we travel through
this process of trauma,

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:08.860 align:middle line:84%
which is getting to a
point which is chaos--

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:12.880 align:middle line:84%
trauma, power, raw
energy that's unleashed,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and then the restructuring,
the reframing of it.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Another thing happened
with your mother.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:24.454 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now your mother is
in this awful accident.

00:40:24.454 --> 00:40:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about it,
and what happened with you.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:30.523 align:middle line:84%
Because she was reduced to
basically being a baby, right?

00:40:30.523 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I was working at work,
and doing my calculations.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
most amazing thing.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Around five minutes before
I get this phone call,

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I go into the restroom and I
see one of my other coworkers

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:48.230 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.360 align:middle line:90%
And she and I are talking.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And I look at her and
I say, whatever you do,

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.420 align:middle line:84%
be careful when you walk
across the street today.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:90%
Just be very careful.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me--
and Vicky is her name.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And she's one that's still a
very dear friend of mine today.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at
me and she says,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.310 align:middle line:90%
what are you talking about?

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, please be
very careful when

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.250 align:middle line:90%
you walk across the street.

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:11.321 align:middle line:90%
Look both ways!

00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, you're super--

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.857 align:middle line:90%
you're super intuitive.

00:41:13.857 --> 00:41:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And that's
when I realized,

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that was the intuitive
side that came out.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And five minutes later
I get this phone call.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.934 align:middle line:84%
It was probably only
five or 10 minutes later,

00:41:24.934 --> 00:41:25.850 align:middle line:90%
I get this phone call.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And I had been told that my
mother was in the hospital.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.470 align:middle line:84%
She was a pedestrian
walking across the street.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And she was hit
through the accident,

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and bashing her head--
with her head bashed open.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And she had to go
through brain surgery.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't she have a pole
or something fall on her head?

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, her skull was
cracked a lot of ways.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: Her skull
was cracked open.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was a good
thing in the end, right?

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: It was a
good thing, because it

00:41:54.810 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:84%
allowed there to be blood to
exit her cranial capacity.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So it wouldn't be an
over-pressurization

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.080 align:middle line:90%
of her skull.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.038 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:42:04.038 --> 00:42:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And so her brain
could actually survive.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: And she
survived the surgery.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know whether
or not she was going to live.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But not only that,
the surgeons saw

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:20.180 align:middle line:84%
that she had broken
vertebrae in her back.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.815 align:middle line:84%
And there were at
least five surgeons

00:42:21.815 --> 00:42:26.580 align:middle line:84%
that all witnessed this
all at the same time.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
told about that,

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.935 align:middle line:84%
we were just
completely in shock.

00:42:30.935 --> 00:42:33.470 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And we prayed.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that
we came back the next day.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:42.180 align:middle line:84%
My mother not only
survived the surgery,

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:84%
but when they took x-rays
to see her broken vertebrae,

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:51.920 align:middle line:84%
there were no signs
at all anymore

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.512 align:middle line:84%
of any broken vertebrae,
even though the surgeons all

00:42:55.512 --> 00:42:56.720 align:middle line:90%
witnessed it with their eyes.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
this is a matter

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.240 align:middle line:84%
of extreme chaos,
extreme trauma,

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.800 align:middle line:84%
but a very heavily focused
will combined with faith.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And you had the force
of faith and will,

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:15.110 align:middle line:84%
combined with her
soul's own desire

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:16.980 align:middle line:90%
to create a miraculous outcome.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:27.426 align:middle line:90%
My mother-- she's Wonder Woman.

00:43:27.426 --> 00:43:29.835 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and she gave
birth to one-- at least one.

00:43:29.835 --> 00:43:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Thank you.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.660 align:middle line:90%


00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.198 align:middle line:84%
There's a great
end to the story.

00:43:35.198 --> 00:43:36.948 align:middle line:84%
I must say, your
audience is about to hear

00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:37.080 align:middle line:90%
the great end of this story.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.621 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love
this next part, too,

00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:84%
that's going to happen
in a second here.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: She had to learn
how to walk, talk, eat, sleep,

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and drink again.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was
just completely in chaos.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine the earthquake
type of situation.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Now this was even far more
stressful-- far more stressful

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.500 align:middle line:84%
than the earthquake
situation, bumped up,

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.270 align:middle line:90%
magnitude 10 more times.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.120 align:middle line:90%
This is my mother.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And so my youngest sister
and I, we took in our mother.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.680 align:middle line:90%
And we cared for her.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.170 align:middle line:90%
And we worked with the surgeons.

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:22.000 align:middle line:90%
We worked with the neurologist.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.460 align:middle line:84%
We worked with the
physical therapist,

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:29.470 align:middle line:84%
we worked with
the kinesiologist,

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.560 align:middle line:84%
doing anything and everything we
could-- nutritionist, anything

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and everything to
help our mother.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And when people meet her
today, when they meet her

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.390 align:middle line:84%
they have no clue of
what she's gone through.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: We know.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She's beautiful.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:46.725 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Thank you.

00:44:46.725 --> 00:44:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.280 align:middle line:84%
She's a beautiful
person, inside and out.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And she helped me
so much, because I

00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:01.520 align:middle line:84%
was able to see what the
human will is able to do.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and it was your
combined will in this case,

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.780 align:middle line:90%
which is really--

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that's the story of the
potential of humanity.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's the story
of the potential

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.944 align:middle line:90%
of our healing through trauma.

00:45:12.944 --> 00:45:15.110 align:middle line:84%
In your book, you talk about
a lot of different ways

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:17.180 align:middle line:84%
we can start accessing
these parts of ourselves--

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yes, yes.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
the recognition

00:45:18.915 --> 00:45:22.790 align:middle line:84%
of truth within our own being is
the power point that unleashes

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:25.100 align:middle line:84%
all of this energy,
as happened to you,

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and myself, and many
people watching, right?

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, yeah.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you talk
about different methods

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.570 align:middle line:90%
that we can do that through.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: I give
exercises in the book.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you give
exercises in the book.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so at least one-- you have
all these things in your book.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But let's just take
one little tip,

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:84%
for example, a little
exercise you give people.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: This
is a fun exercise.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It is getting in touch with what
you are thinking when you don't

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.250 align:middle line:90%
know what you're thinking.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:52.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's really simple.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.440 align:middle line:90%
It is to journal.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And you just simply take out
some blank sheets of paper

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.770 align:middle line:90%
and take out a pen.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And you literally
write down everything

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.490 align:middle line:84%
which is going through your mind
about a particular situation

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.654 align:middle line:90%
that's stressing you out.

00:46:05.654 --> 00:46:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And you write and
write and write.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Get everything it is that
you need off your chest

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:11.270 align:middle line:90%
onto this piece of paper.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unedited, obviously.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Unedited.

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unanalyzed.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Unanalyzed.

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.980 align:middle line:90%
It is raw.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: You
just put this out.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And you just get it
out of your body.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Literally, by you moving
it through your hands,

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.870 align:middle line:84%
through your nervous system, and
putting it on a piece of paper,

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:32.960 align:middle line:84%
you're actually changing
the energy inside of you.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So when you write it on this
piece of paper, you get it up.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's acknowledgment.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.030 align:middle line:84%
You know how even in
traditional settings, when

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.310 align:middle line:84%
people are going through,
let's say, difficult times--

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in AA where
they say, OK, you've

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:47.540 align:middle line:84%
first got to admit
that there's a problem.

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: This is
the first thing.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.760 align:middle line:90%
You've got to write it down.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
is a science, too.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like admitting
that there's a problem.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:54.860 align:middle line:90%
There's a problem!

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.170 align:middle line:90%
So often, we bottle things up.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And we don't address
how we're really

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:02.120 align:middle line:90%
feeling about a situation.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And we keep it-- we are not
speaking up for ourself.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:06.744 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:06.744 --> 00:47:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I actually did an interview
a little while ago

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.210 align:middle line:84%
with a woman named
Eileen Day McKusick.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:14.485 align:middle line:84%
And basically, her area
is healing through tone,

00:47:14.485 --> 00:47:16.610 align:middle line:84%
but looking at it from a
scientific point of view--

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That all these
traumas are layered and trapped

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.340 align:middle line:84%
in the aura as it extends
out from the body,

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.840 align:middle line:90%
almost like tree rings.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And she uses tone, in her
case, to start unleashing

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.870 align:middle line:90%
the power of those traumas.

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: So in this case,
unleashing that type of trauma

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:36.110 align:middle line:90%
is through action.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's conscious
action of acknowledging

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:40.010 align:middle line:90%
where the problem is.

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:42.200 align:middle line:84%
How you feel about
something, and recognizing

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.550 align:middle line:90%
there needs to be a shift.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: So that's number one.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:45.920 align:middle line:90%
So you write this down.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Very easy.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.460 align:middle line:90%
All right, wait some time.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Eat some food.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Go for a walk.

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Do something that just
clears your brain.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And then come back to this,
maybe 10 minutes later,

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.420 align:middle line:84%
next day, whenever you
feel the strength to do it.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.970 align:middle line:90%
And you re-read the paper--

00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:59.809 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:47:59.809 --> 00:48:01.100 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be like, oh, my god!

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.510 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe I wrote that.

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, oh, my God.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you take your
non-dominant hand--

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.770 align:middle line:84%
whatever hand it is that
you do not write with.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:11.570 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
write with that hand.

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to sit down.

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:17.279 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to literally
write a letter to yourself.

00:48:17.279 --> 00:48:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That takes some time.

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:19.819 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: It takes some time.

00:48:19.819 --> 00:48:22.019 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard some
people-- like, they

00:48:22.019 --> 00:48:23.060 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to write.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.530 align:middle line:90%
And just gibberish comes out.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:28.940 align:middle line:84%
It takes a little
while to do this.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.580 align:middle line:90%
You write from your heart.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:35.330 align:middle line:84%
You write whatever you hear,
whatever comes to your vision,

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:36.980 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is that you sense.

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.640 align:middle line:84%
This is for you to
actually embrace

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.170 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you are sensing
and feeling and experiencing

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.682 align:middle line:90%
that is going to be eye-opening.

00:48:47.682 --> 00:48:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: About
the same situation?

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.639 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: About
the same situation.

00:48:50.639 --> 00:48:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And you write a letter
back to yourself

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.350 align:middle line:84%
with whatever comes to
your heart, whatever

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:56.240 align:middle line:84%
comes to your brain,
whatever comes to you.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.760 align:middle line:90%
And you don't think about it.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.620 align:middle line:90%
You just do it.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you do it,
you write whatever

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:09.760 align:middle line:84%
it is that you need to
look at, really get it out.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Then you read the
letter that you wrote.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:19.750 align:middle line:84%
When you read the letter that
you wrote back to yourself,

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:21.310 align:middle line:90%
that tells you--

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:23.020 align:middle line:90%
nine times out of 10--

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.110 align:middle line:84%
the answer to how to handle
the situation that you're

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:27.230 align:middle line:90%
dealing with right now.

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes total sense.

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.250 align:middle line:84%
It's using opposite sides
of the brain, and as you

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:31.750 align:middle line:90%
say, the Triabrain.

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.730 align:middle line:84%
The intuitive, the
heart-- all of that

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:36.010 align:middle line:84%
starts coming together
at the same time.

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Makes total sense.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.960 align:middle line:90%
That's a great tip.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And my family-- my
mother's Native American.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.330 align:middle line:10%
And so there's a
Native American ritual

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:47.220 align:middle line:10%
of burning and giving
back to the earth,

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:50.620 align:middle line:10%
recognizing that Mother Earth
is going to handle this,

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.500 align:middle line:10%
and honoring the
big flow of things

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.200 align:middle line:10%
in a way that's
bigger than our self.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I have learned from
my coach is to literally--

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.540 align:middle line:90%
and this is just what I do.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is just me
personally, what I did.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.520 align:middle line:90%
I wrote this letter at first.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.560 align:middle line:10%
And I wrote the
letter back to myself.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And I would just pray over it.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would put it
in a big steel pot.

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'd burn it!

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:15.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LEPOINT: I'd burn
it and I'd bury it.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'd give it
back to the Earth.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:18.880 align:middle line:90%
And I'd just pray.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm like God and
Earth, I just ask

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that you take this and
rebirth it into something

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.070 align:middle line:90%
that's going to be meaningful.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On that note--

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.120 align:middle line:84%
well, you've been
absolutely delightful.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I've so enjoyed spending
my time with you.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And you have a lot
more tips in the book.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:34.510 align:middle line:10%
>>LEPOINT: Oh, I have--

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:35.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We've just barely
scratched the surface,

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:37.870 align:middle line:10%
because I was so into
your personal story

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:40.380 align:middle line:10%
that we neglected to get
into some of the science,

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.260 align:middle line:10%
as I said earlier.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.112 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:50:42.112 --> 00:50:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that wants to dive
deeper can go to the book.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Thank you.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
being on your show.

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:48.196 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:50:48.196 --> 00:50:51.280 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title of Olympia's
book is "Answers Unleashed--

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.740 align:middle line:10%
The Science of Unleashing
Your Brain's Power."

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.750 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:07.264 align:middle line:90%
