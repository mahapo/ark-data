>>EILEEN DAY MCKUSICK: When
I start using my tuning forks

around people, their
therapeutic outcomes

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.450 align:middle line:84%
started becoming
really dramatic.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.430 align:middle line:84%
People that had had
pain for 30 years,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.960 align:middle line:90%
it was gone in one session.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:84%
People that had
massive anxiety, it's

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:90%
gone in just a few sessions.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:84%
What people were reporting
to me was really stunning

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:90%
and astonishing and unexpected.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Any time we're not in
integrity or authenticity

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
or we're suppressing
or repressing

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:84%
what our body
naturally wants to do,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
that all creates
resistance in the system,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.268 align:middle line:84%
and then our voltage gets
caught up in the resistance.

00:00:44.268 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Interesting.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Instead of the flow.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:84%
The biofield-- what
we call a biofield--

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:90%
the body's electrical system--

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.740 align:middle line:90%
is our conscious mind.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:90%
It's our subconscious mind.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.625 align:middle line:84%
But I would also
call it our soul.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when
people have an experience

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:84%
of their own inner illumination,
the only framework,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
they have to apply
it to is religious.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:84%
But when you have an
understanding that

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:84%
this is part of your
biological reality--

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.727 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: That
you are electric,

00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that you do have
an inner life, then

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes both
spiritual and scientific.

>>REGINA: Virtually
everyone in this community

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
has used the term
"raising our vibrations."

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But what many of us need now
is another kind of raising--

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:90%
raising our voltage.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
How many of us have been
feeling frayed, confused, even

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
physically weakened
by the times?

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'll raise my
hand on that one.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Eileen McKusick is going
to share with us how

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:84%
we can care for our
electric selves,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:90%
without which we'd be dead.

Welcome back.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It's been a few years
since I've seen you.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:84%
A lot has happened
in your world,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost like what you're
doing was made for these times

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:84%
People need a lot
of help right now.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're, like I
said, exhausted,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and you have a whole different
way of explaining that.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.695 align:middle line:90%

For those who didn't
see our first interview,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.487 align:middle line:84%
let's just go back into
your life a little bit

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:07.619 align:middle line:84%
to begin with because you had
burnout really early in life

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:90%
in your youth.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about and
your own electrical story.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.547 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well, yeah, I burned
out several times, actually.

00:02:14.547 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there are
other people who've

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:90%
had that experience as well.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy to do.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:10%
Our culture demands so
much of us, and women,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:10%
we think we have to do it all.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:10%
But my first experience
of burnout came--

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:10%
I started a restaurant with my
family when I was 20 years old,

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:10%
and I worked 100-hour weeks
on my feet really for years,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:10%
and completely toasted myself.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I had the experience of
feeling like burnt toast.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally, physically,
mentally exhausted, strung out.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Just couldn't take it anymore.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Really needed a
big pattern reset.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and you went
on, you did get out of that.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But then you were very
entrepreneurial, which you are.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're a powerful woman.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And you came up with
an idea I just loved.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:90%
So what happened there?

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So you thought OK go the
entrepreneurial route.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well,
after I got out

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
of the restaurant, my husband
and I moved to Vermont.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to find a
good-paying job in Vermont.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was
I'd been doing this work

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
with tuning forks on
the side since 1996.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But then my practice sessions
with my clients with the tuning

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
fork-- and I was seeing maybe
two, three people a week--

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
previously when I
started doing it,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I was just working
right over their bodies.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But I discovered
sort of by accident

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
that there was stuff going
on around people's bodies.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when I start using my
tuning forks around people,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
their therapeutic
outcomes started

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:90%
becoming really dramatic.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
People that had had
pain for 30 years,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:90%
it was gone in one session.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
People that had
massive anxiety, it's

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:90%
gone in just a few sessions.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
What people were
reporting to me was really

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
kind of stunning and
astonishing and unexpected.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I had unwittingly

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
stumbled into the
kind of healing

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:90%
that people are looking for.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
vibrational healing.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.415 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Vibrational healing,
but really getting right

00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:90%
into it and solving a problem.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Just solving the problem.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so how does
voltage factor into that story?

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well, it
took me a long time

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to come to understand that the
part of the body that I was

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with
with the tuning forks

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:84%
was the body's electrical
system in its entirety.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Now have you ever heard of
the body's electrical system?

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I only have
because I've been researching

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:90%
this stuff for 30 years.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so the body
electric and all that.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I had, but most people
certainly had not.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Most
people have not.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:84%
The fellow that wrote
"The Body Electric,"

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
he was talking about the body's
electrical system, Robert O.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Becker back in the '80s.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.507 align:middle line:90%
That's when I read it.

00:04:49.507 --> 00:04:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, but
that never made it

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:84%
into any kind of
mainstream awareness.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
We're just very conditioned to
think of ourselves chemically

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:90%
and mechanically.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.547 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: But when
you think about it,

00:05:00.547 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
everything in our body
is actually electric.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Like our heart is
running on electricity.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Our brain waves,
when you get an EKG,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
that's electrical
activity in the brain.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
We're just very conditioned to
think of ourselves chemically

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and mechanically.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.567 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: But when
you think about it,

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
everything in our body
is actually electric.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Like our heart is running on
electricity, our brain waves.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
When you get an EKG,
that's electrical activity

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Our bones are electric.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Our blood carries a charge.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Our fascia or collagen,
like everything,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:84%
is actually running on and
conducting electricity.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And anything that has an
electrical current running

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
through it, like our human body,
has a magnetic field around it,

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.040 align:middle line:90%
and that's just basic science.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And so what I discovered
was that I was actually

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with and
working with the body's

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:90%
electrical system.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
That I was finding areas
of noise and resistance

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:84%
in the electrical
field and getting

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:90%
it to resolve and release.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I fix things at
the level of the body's

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.245 align:middle line:84%
electric system, it resolved
in the rest of the body.

00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about-- first of all,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:84%
just to get a baseline, what
is it that creates voltage--

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:84%
raises our voltage, and what
is it that lowers our voltage?

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So we get a baseline
to this conversation

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:84%
where one of our lovely
viewers can tap in themselves

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, that's me.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah,
well, first of all, I

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:84%
would invite people to think
of themselves like a battery.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:90%
You have a battery meter.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So on a scale of 1 to 100,
where is your battery meter

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:90%
at right now?

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:90%
What's your level of charge?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd say
like 65% right now.

00:06:37.988 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And
that's really common.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a lot of people
often answer like 60--

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:90%
and obviously it's variable.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: But if you had a
business with 100 employees,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and only 65 were showing
up for work every day,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:84%
your business wouldn't
be optimized at all.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.913 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And
that's what it's like.

00:06:54.913 --> 00:06:57.230 align:middle line:84%
When your battery isn't full,
you're not fully present,

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and you're not able
to do all the things

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:90%
that you're capable of doing.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
voltage and this idea

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.830 align:middle line:84%
of raising voltage, it's about
raising that battery meter.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:84%
It's about optimizing
our electric health.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's many ways
that it goes down.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I've observed
is that most people

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:90%
give more than they receive.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
They discharge more
than they recharge.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:90%
They hold themselves back.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
They hold back their emotions,
they hold back their words,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
they hold back their
truth, they say

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:90%
what other people want to hear.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So any time we're not in
integrity or authenticity

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
or we're suppressing
or repressing

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
what our body
naturally wants to do,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that all creates
resistance in the system,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.603 align:middle line:84%
and then our voltage gets
caught up in the resistance--

00:07:45.603 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Instead of the flow.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be
in a flow state.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So ways that we raise our
voltage, certainly movement.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Our bones actually
produce electricity

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:90%
when they're compressed.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So exercising, dancing,
bouncing on trampolines,

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Walking--

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Percussive movement.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, walking
with a spring in your step.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that helps
build electricity.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Allowing our emotions to flow.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
What I really
discovered that allows

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:84%
most people and most people's
experience of physical pain

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:84%
is actually some kind of emotion
that we're repressing or not

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:90%
allowing ourselves to feel.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be the single
biggest inhibitor of voltage

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:90%
is mismanagement of emotions.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's also
the single biggest factor

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.365 align:middle line:90%
in the creation of disease.

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yes.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Disease.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Same thing.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And low voltage is
the same as low pH.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact same thing.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Dr.
Jerry Tennant talks

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.655 align:middle line:84%
about that equation of
low voltage and low pH

00:08:48.655 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:90%
being the same thing.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's a
keystone in translating

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
our language from chemical speak
when we talk about our health

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:90%
to electric speak--

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: When we
talk about our health.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and when
you were burning out,

00:09:00.827 --> 00:09:01.755 align:middle line:90%
you were also living--

00:09:01.755 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:84%
if you want to get into the
more chemical mechanical part

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:84%
of it-- you were living
on carbs and caffeine.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what you
did, and then get rid of it.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Just seems like, oh, I'm
going to get fat if I do this.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
You had your own kind of eating
disorder that a lot of women

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
have that you had
to work through.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But that was your way
of giving yourself

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
cheap juice, which

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
it seems that our society is
running on the cheap stuff.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK:
Definitely, definitely.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And one of the really important
factors in electric health

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
is the minerals that
is in our food supply,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and most commercially produced
food has virtually no minerals.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:84%
I recently interviewed
a friend of mine

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.100 align:middle line:84%
who runs a very
beautiful organic farm,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and he was telling me about
the science of soil management

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and getting all of
the right things in.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:84%
That it doesn't only impact
the mineral quality of the food

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.623 align:middle line:90%
but also the taste--

00:09:53.623 --> 00:09:54.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: And the flavor.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.828 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, if anyone
has had the opportunity to have

00:09:57.828 --> 00:10:00.570 align:middle line:84%
truly
biodynamically-raised food,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
for example, which takes the
cosmos, the soil, everything

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:84%
into consideration,
the flavor is a punch.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
You would think there were
enhancements to it when

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:84%
it's just the natural vitamins
and minerals in the foods.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So absolutely, but that also
brings with it more voltage,

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yes, more voltage.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
More minerals transfers the
electricity in your body.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you're eating a diet of
food that's depleted minerals,

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
or even a lot of people
think reverse osmosis

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
water is good for
you, but it's really

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
not because it's taken
all of the minerals out.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.262 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And we absolutely
need the minerals and the salts

00:10:32.262 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
in our body to keep our
batteries working properly.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.272 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you think about at,

00:10:36.272 --> 00:10:38.481 align:middle line:84%
this point in the conversation--
we'll just stay here

00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
for a second-- what do you
think about supplementation

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%
like cell food?

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Using various minerals
from the sea or so forth.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this is a good
idea, since so many foods are

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:90%
so depleted now?

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: You
know, I'm really not

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:90%
a specialist on supplements.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Because what I figured
out is that when

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:84%
you raise your voltage
sufficiently in all these ways

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:84%
by getting enough rest
and eating the right foods

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and speaking your truth and
allowing your emotions to flow

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:84%
through you, letting
yourself feel love and joy,

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.740 align:middle line:84%
doing what I call
following your updrafts.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Going with the ahs
instead of the uhs.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
When you have
sufficient voltage,

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.533 align:middle line:84%
you don't really
require supplements.

00:11:21.533 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as long
as you're in the sun,

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.680 align:middle line:84%
you're touching
the Earth, you're

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
doing a little percussive
exercise, even walking,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
something as gentle as walking,
and raising your voltage

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:84%
these ways, the food
almost becomes secondary.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, I mean I
think that you don't have to be

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.390 align:middle line:90%
quite so religious about food.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: I think that a lot
of people go into that, oh,

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I have to only eat clean thing,
and that's really a trap.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a limitation.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I actually follow what I
call moderate hedonism,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:90%
because I like all the bad--

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.925 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: All the bad things.

00:11:51.925 --> 00:11:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And so I
give myself permission

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.100 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy small amounts
of whatever I want.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't label anything
as bad or wrong.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I have a very strong
digestive track, which

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:90%
didn't used to be the case.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Like many people, I had
gas, bloating, indigestion,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:84%
heartburn, stomach aches,
constipation, all of that.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
a consequence

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
of giving my power away,
my own solar plexus

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:84%
energy being scattered to the
wind, and my voltage being low.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I was doing all the wrong
things for my electric health.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to
understand electric health

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and the importance of having
high voltage in the body,

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I came to see that
even our digestion is

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:90%
an electrical fermentation.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
You have all these gut bacteria
in there that are electric,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:90%
and that is what--

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.920 align:middle line:84%
you're essentially
incinerating your food.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started to
bring my own energy back

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
through receiving biofield
tuning from students

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
electric health,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
my whole digestive
experience changed.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel like I can
incinerate anything and not

00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:90%
suffer from it.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So here you are now,
we're going to go more

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
into the actual biofield
tuning in just a sec.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
We're just kind of getting
to know your story.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.422 align:middle line:84%
So now here you are
so many years later.

00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
this a long time.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.463 align:middle line:84%
You've charted the whole thing,
which we're going to get into,

00:13:15.463 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:90%
mapped it.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And you now have a couple
thousand practitioners,

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:90%
you're teaching all the time.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
You could be exhausted
again because you have

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:90%
more work than there are yous.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So what are you doing
to protect yourself,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:84%
or is it just so it's such
an innate part of your being

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
to use the forks and all these
healthy principles you can now

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:90%
take on more?

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, I
think the combination

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:84%
of receiving a lot of tuning--
so part of what makes us tired

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.282 align:middle line:84%
and drags us down is all the
undigested emotions we're

00:13:42.282 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:90%
carrying around in our field.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It's our baggage.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.265 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Because that
baggage is actually living

00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:90%
in your electrical system.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And so biofield tuning is
like using a tuning fork

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.420 align:middle line:84%
as a comb to tease out
tangles in your hair.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when you get all
smoothed and groomed

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and you've digested
and integrated

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
all of this past pain,
just in and of itself,

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:90%
you feel lighter.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.267 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's what
people say whenever

00:14:09.267 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:90%
they receive a session.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
The adjective that most people
use is that they feel lighter.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've had thousands of
sessions at this point.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.642 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've got
enough to keep you going.

00:14:17.642 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: I feel super,
super light and able, yeah,

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:90%
to keep going.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't ever feel tired or--

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and I also am in tune
enough with my body

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.830 align:middle line:84%
to know when I need a nap, when
I need to say no to things.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't push myself to be
like, oh, I have to go do this.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:84%
My battery meter is the
most important thing here,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and so I'm going to
take care of that.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I like to keep myself
between 90 and 100,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.392 align:middle line:84%
like topped off all the
time, staying there.

00:14:47.392 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Learning to say
no is the big one.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yep.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.632 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Especially for women.

00:14:51.632 --> 00:14:53.895 align:middle line:84%
So here we go, we're going
to talk about actually

00:14:53.895 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:90%
going into the field.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So you started really mapping
the field, and what was showing

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:90%
itself where within the body.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And you started seeing with
thousands and thousands

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
of cases these universal truths
within the physical body,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
the ORC field that
you were teasing out.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So you could
predictably and reliably

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:90%
start working with clients.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about the phenomena

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:84%
of the sound of the
forks when interfacing

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
with certain conditions
versus healthy areas.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Sure.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, everything in
the body is in motion,

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and anything that's
in motion makes waves,

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:90%
and waves propagate.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you
get an EEG on your head,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.071 align:middle line:84%
and they put all
those electrodes,

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that information they're
reading has made it

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:90%
all the way through the skull.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, so those vibrations
being generated in the head

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:90%
don't stop at the skull.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
They go out into the
world around you.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you have something
wrong with your car,

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and your car is
making a funny noise,

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and you bring it
to a good mechanic,

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:84%
he will know by the
sound that your car

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
is making that it's the left
CV boot or something like that.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
You might not know, but he's
heard enough of those to know.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if something
isn't moving properly,

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:90%
it makes noise.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.065 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And so it's
the same in our human body.

00:16:13.065 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
If something in our body
isn't moving properly,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:84%
it will give off waves
that are discordant.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if somebody has
arthritis in this joint but not

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
this joint, the
vibrational emanations

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
of that area of
the body are going

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:84%
to carry the information of
that arthritis, that degradation

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:90%
of the bone of the joint.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.177 align:middle line:84%
And so when I hold a
tuning fork near it,

00:16:42.177 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:84%
where these waves
are being given off,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:84%
there's an
intersection of waves.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:84%
The tuning forks
produce technically

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
an infinite number of
overtones and undertones,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and those intersect with
these inaudible waves

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
coming off the body.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Probably at the
very high overtones

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
where you can't
hear it, but then

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.810 align:middle line:84%
it precipitates down through the
octaves into the hearing range.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:84%
So that the tuning fork actually
becomes like an invisible ink

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
decoder, and it allows me
to hear the different sounds

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.099 align:middle line:90%
that the body is making.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So an arthritic
joint sounds grainy.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a grainy texture
in the tone that isn't

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.329 align:middle line:90%
coming from a healthy joint.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:24.343 align:middle line:90%
So I know immediately--

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Grainy as
in kind of staticky?

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, it's kind
of staticky and grainy.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has
fatty liver, that

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
sounds really different
than a healthy liver.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has a joint that's
out of whack or a subluxation

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:84%
in the spine, all of these
things have different tones.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So I can pretty much diagnose
what is going on in the body.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.948 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a doctor, so
this isn't a medical--

00:17:47.948 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, but
you can listen here

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and say, something's
up with the liver.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was a time that
I was working on a young man,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and he was a yoga instructor,
and he was a spiritual guy.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And I held the fork
over his pancreas,

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and it made this horrible
screeching sound.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.810 align:middle line:84%
He was probably like
32 or 33 years old.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard
anything like it.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, what's that?

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's
your pancreas.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, whoa.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But what's neat,
what's very cool

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.273 align:middle line:84%
about this is that when the body
hears itself sounding terrible,

00:18:21.273 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
it's like looking in the
mirror and seeing you

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:90%
of a poppy seed in your teeth.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:84%
You just want to
fix it right away.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:90%
We are self-tuning instruments.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And when the body hears
itself sounding not right,

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.520 align:middle line:84%
it uses the input of the
tuning fork-- steady tone,

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:90%
coherent rhythm--

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:84%
as a biofeedback mirror
to balance itself against.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
up with his pancreas?

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.905 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well,
this is really funny.

00:18:46.905 --> 00:18:48.868 align:middle line:84%
So we were just doing
a trade for some work

00:18:48.868 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:84%
that he did for me, and I
actually didn't see him again

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:90%
for a few months.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I ran into him in
the grocery store.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
remember that sound

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:90%
that my pancreas was making?

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.685 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I
couldn't forget it.

00:18:58.685 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, I knew
exactly what it was.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, what was it?

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.910 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was drinking
five Red Bulls a day.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.275 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: I
said, did you stop?

00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, I stopped
immediately after hearing what

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:90%
it was doing to my pancreas.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And these same
principles, by the way,

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:84%
apply with the brain
and neurofeedback.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The brain will seek when it
hears certain tones to try

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:90%
to correct them on its own.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So the intelligence of the body
to have a mirror and things

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
reflected back to it,
I find fascinating.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:84%
But let me ask you this--
why does our body, why

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:84%
does our brain need something
reflected back to it

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:84%
rather than just going
after it, knowing already

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.225 align:middle line:90%
that it's out of balance?

00:19:35.225 --> 00:19:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: I think
for the same reason

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:84%
you don't take the poppy
seed out of your tooth,

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:90%
because you didn't see it.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So the body's just going
along doing its thing,

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.500 align:middle line:84%
because it has a lot of
work to do every day.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's just trying to
regenerate and repair

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So if it can be given a heads
up about a particular area

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:90%
that needs a lot of work--

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: And support.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:52.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And support.

00:19:52.765 --> 00:19:54.473 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: It's not
just the reflection.

00:19:54.473 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:84%
It's also a strong,
coherent signal

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:84%
will overtake a weak,
incoherent signal.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's this strong
coherent signal showing up

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:90%
and the body responding to that.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And the weak
incoherent goes away,

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and the body is left
with more coherence.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to go
into the parts of the body

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of information you
get from these various parts

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:90%
on a more universal level.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's talk about
the way you look at the body

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and the way you and the
people you've taught,

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:84%
the practitioners
around the world,

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
look at this, which
is, we'll start with--

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I almost call them like tree
rings of light and information.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So talk about the rings
surrounding our body.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And because I had a session
with you few years ago,

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and I found it fascinating
as you go through.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the tuning
fork, and woo, there's

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:90%
some resistance.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:90%
What happened at two?

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, what happened at seven?

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.508 align:middle line:84%
So you're tuning into the
areas of resistance, right?

00:20:51.508 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what you're doing

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
on the left side
of the body first.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: OK, well,
to frame the context,

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.480 align:middle line:84%
we see the body's electrical
system as shaped like a Taurus.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's a sphere with a spiral
channel down the middle,

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's bounded
at about six feet

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.850 align:middle line:84%
with a double layer
plasma membrane.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
exploring around the body,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
it started to
become evident to me

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
that when I hit
something that was stuck

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:84%
or that made the fork sound
funny that it was a memory.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that our
memories in in our brains,

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:84%
so why am I finding
memories three

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:90%
feet off your left shoulder?

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
It was like, what's
going on here?

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're in our field.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah,
they're in our field.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
This is what I found is that
because every experience that

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
we have-- whatever we see
smell, touch, taste, feel--

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:84%
is all an electrical
impulse in the body.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It's all in our
electrical system,

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:84%
so it makes sense
that our memories

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:84%
are stored in our body's
electrical system.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And so what became evident
to me was that our memory--

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:84%
like as we're feeling
and experiencing

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:84%
going about our lives, it's
almost like a needle readout.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:84%
That information is getting
laid down in our magnetic field.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And so memories that
are close to the body

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:90%
are current or recent.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Information I find at the
very outer edge of the field

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
is gestation in that
outer band is gestation.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Just inside that is birth.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And then every other
year falls in between,

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:90%
like rings in a tree.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm working
on someone who's 60,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to find
information that

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
happened when they were 30
about three feet away from them.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's the timeline aspect.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:84%
But then I discovered that
the field was actually

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:84%
compartmentalized or striated
and that different zones

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:84%
seem to hold different
emotional feelings.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
on the left side,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I think the very first
zone that I discovered

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:90%
was off the left shoulder.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that every
time I was working here,

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.390 align:middle line:84%
the sound that the fork
was making sounded sad.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So just like music can
evoke emotion in us--

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
like if you and I were
listening to a sad song, Regina,

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.775 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have to say to
you, Regina, this song is sad.

00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Because you'd be like, duh.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The minor notes
will give that away, right?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Right,
you'll just know.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.027 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And so that's
how I mapped the field was

00:23:19.027 --> 00:23:20.970 align:middle line:90%
because it was like music.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, it would
sound like a sad song.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I start to understand
this timeline thing and then

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
this compartmentalization
thing, I could hit a spot,

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.093 align:middle line:84%
and I'd be like, OK, this has
happened about 15 years ago.

00:23:33.093 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:90%
It's in the zone of sadness.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:84%
What does that
make you think of?

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:10%
That was when my dog died or
that was when my, whatever,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:10%
so it became very accurate.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that
different-- so over time,

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:84%
this whole biofield anatomy
map that I call came into view.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was really just a
process of pattern recognition,

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:84%
of being like every time
I'm here, it sounds angry.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Off the right side
of the solar plexus,

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
the liver, and that correlates
to Chinese medicine.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:84%
You say anger
stored in the liver,

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and that was what
I found as well.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I also found that our
father, our relationship

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
with our father
relates to the liver,

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship with our
mother relates to the spleen.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.743 align:middle line:90%
So we can find information.

00:24:15.743 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you have
two fixed points

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.423 align:middle line:84%
off either side of your
field right about here,

00:24:20.423 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
where if I stick a fork in
the one on the left side,

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.333 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you all about your
mother and her personality,

00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you
all about your father

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:90%
and his personality.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And when I
explore the space in between,

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you about the
quality of your relationship

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And oftentimes
when we're working deeply

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:84%
on issues with parents, a person
will get out of the session

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and discover that
parent had texted them

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.810 align:middle line:84%
while we were doing this
session because they

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:45.130 align:middle line:84%
catch the vibe, which is
really kind of interesting.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.047 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you go
even further than this.

00:24:47.047 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
You go into longer, greater
ancestral information.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Now how does-- you
talked about at what

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:84%
point three feet
out and so forth

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:84%
this certain
information shows up.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.238 align:middle line:84%
How are you detecting
ancestral patterns?

00:24:59.238 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: So the
ancestral patterns

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.738 align:middle line:90%
are really interesting.

00:25:01.738 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They show up in two
different places.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the places we
find it is at the very

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:90%
outer edge of the field.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you popped into
the time space continuum,

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
you are absolutely
informed by what's

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.750 align:middle line:84%
happening-- what was
already going on there.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.508 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: What was
going on with your parents

00:25:19.508 --> 00:25:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and their parents and the
time and place and culture

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:22.900 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So the place where
were we would pop out--

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: All of
that information

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:90%
is out of that outer boundary.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So I find ancestral
information there,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.767 align:middle line:84%
but then I discovered
these other features

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:34.350 align:middle line:84%
that are actually
kind of interesting.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.790 align:middle line:84%
About 10 inches on
either side of the body,

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:84%
there are what I call
ancestral rivers.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And on the left side is
the flow of information

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:84%
from the mother's side, and on
the right is the father's side.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And I can access it at any point
down the body from the foot up

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:84%
to the head, and it's like the
DNA strand that we inherited

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.348 align:middle line:84%
and the information
that's contained in it.

00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
understanding what

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:84%
was going on here
and listening to it,

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I started using the
term "inner genetics."

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't think
I coined that.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find
where it came from.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I saw a few other people using
it before I started using it.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But basically what
I use it to describe

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.040 align:middle line:84%
is the tone of the
song of our DNA.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Because we come preloaded
with tonal proclivities.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And if depression runs
in a family line--

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:90%
now I can hear depression.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It shows up off
the left shoulder,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and it has a very
strong undertone, uh.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:84%
When you feel depressed,
you're like, uh.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what it sounds like.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: That's
what it sounds like.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
tell what it is.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as the body hears
itself sounding like that,

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:90%
it's like, what, I'm flat.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:84%
That's not right, and it'll
start correcting itself.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.980 align:middle line:90%
It's like "ah" instead of "uh."

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just like an
out-of-tune instrument,

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and it isn't even
that hard to fix.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's severe is a
different story than things

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.020 align:middle line:90%
that are mild to moderate.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Right, so people
who have mild to moderate stuff,

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:84%
we can help with things
like anxiety and depression

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:90%
in really just a few sessions.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that
healing is a lifestyle,

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.127 align:middle line:84%
so I'm definitely like,
oh, come in three times,

00:27:14.127 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:90%
and you're fixed for life.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.138 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't say that.

00:27:16.138 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:90%
You have to continue--

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Because
life is stressful.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.258 align:middle line:90%
You have to have maintenance.

00:27:20.258 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So you've talked
about the beauty

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:84%
of the diagnostics of this,
you can even hear it, right?

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And so now let's
look at how you then

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%
apply the tuning forks
to be able to correct

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that frequency that the body
and the self has diagnosed.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well, that's
the beautiful thing.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I say about biofield tuning

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:84%
practitioners is that
we're like technicians.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.420 align:middle line:84%
We're trained to go to
find where the noise is

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and the resistance-- because
you can feel the resistance.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's a funny thing, when
I'm first teaching people,

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.542 align:middle line:84%
they're moving a fork
through thin air.

00:27:52.542 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it gets stuck.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stuck, yeah.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And
they're like, what?

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and it'll sound funny.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So all you have
to do stay there.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:90%
So we'll--

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you just keep it
vibrating and hold it there.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Keep activating
it and hold it there.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does the
tune then change?

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.758 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah,
the tone changes.

00:28:08.758 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:84%
As the body starts to
relax the tension that's

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:84%
associated with that
particular difficult memory,

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.370 align:middle line:90%
the tone starts to change.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.592 align:middle line:84%
And it goes from sounding
full of static or noise.

00:28:17.592 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Or it can actually sound
all different kinds of ways.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Like if I hit the record
of where you were suddenly

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.420 align:middle line:84%
t-boned in a car accident,
the fork is going to go, ah.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And there's
like an alarm sound.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
screaming trauma.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah,
you can hear that.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, It's very
different than depression.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Very different.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or chronic disease.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would think--

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.980 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about cancer
since it's ubiquitous.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:90%
What does cancer sound like?

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well, it's
funny, in my second book,

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I talk about the
cell somatology,

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.690 align:middle line:90%
I think it's called.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.898 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the exact
name, but they've actually

00:28:47.898 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:84%
figured out a way to
listen to cancer cells,

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.790 align:middle line:90%
and they sound cacophonous.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a healthy
cell sounds beautiful.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're easily we're
either making music

00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:59.460 align:middle line:90%
or we're making noise.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And so
cancer, in my observation,

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:84%
shows up in places where
breath isn't going.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Because all these places where
energy is stuck in the field,

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.510 align:middle line:90%
it's also stuck in the body.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:84%
The field is kind of like an
exploded view of the body.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So anything that's
going on in the body

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:90%
is also going on in the field.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Now magnetic fields guide
and inform electric currents.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's just a basic
premise of science.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we
manipulate and modulate

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:34.050 align:middle line:84%
the electricity in
the body at the level

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:35.710 align:middle line:90%
of the magnetic field.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I hit that spot
that's stuck, all I have to do

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.840 align:middle line:90%
is stay there.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.260 align:middle line:90%
The body and the sound do--

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It will start
adjusting and correcting

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.060 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you're able to
tell, as referenced back

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:90%
to you by a nice clear tone.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: The tone changes,
and the resistance lets go.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
The resistance lets
go, and then the energy

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
that was trapped there,
we now are guiding it back

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:90%
into circulation.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Because our electrical
system is all about flow.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Everything needs to flow.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And any place where there's
blocks in that flow, oxygen

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.210 align:middle line:90%
isn't getting to you.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:90%
And so there very often--

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:84%
now obviously, we get sick
for different reasons,

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:84%
environmental reasons
and that sort of thing.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But I've found that men
very often with any advanced

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.170 align:middle line:84%
disease, there's just some
kind of emotion or stressor

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:84%
or memory that you're trying
mightily to not go there,

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:90%
to not go there.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To repress.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: To repress.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not going
there, nutrients aren't going,

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.808 align:middle line:84%
there oxygen isn't going there,
your immune system isn't--

00:30:33.808 --> 00:30:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If your mind is
shunting it, so is your body.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: So is your body.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very good.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:84%
What happened then
in 2020 and 2021

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
once COVID became a
global phenomenon?

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.493 align:middle line:90%
What changed in people's fields?

00:30:45.493 --> 00:30:46.993 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: One of
the things that I

00:30:46.993 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:84%
noticed in people's
fields when COVID started

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:84%
was this heavy blanket of
fear that seemed to just

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.590 align:middle line:90%
be weighing down on everybody.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And even if people weren't
individually afraid,

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.315 align:middle line:84%
they were being impacted
by that collective vibe.

00:31:02.315 --> 00:31:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of
the collective,

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and the sensitive
people out there really

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.190 align:middle line:84%
can feel the vibes
in the collective.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So fear really
came in very large.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, at least
that's a known commodity.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.300 align:middle line:90%
You can work through that one.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just wanted to
know if there was some singular

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:90%
thing that you were picking up.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.522 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: I mean, that's what
I noticed more than anything.

00:31:22.522 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And fear has a kind of pulsing
quality, like doo, doo, doo,

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.060 align:middle line:90%
doo, doo.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you get really
scared, you shake,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's you responding
to the waveform of fear

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:84%
moving through your
electrical system.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.280 align:middle line:90%
It's doo, doo, doo.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And so your body
starts doing that.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and animals do
it naturally and discharge this

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, after animals have
some kind of encounter,

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.682 align:middle line:90%
kerfuffle, they will shake.

00:31:43.682 --> 00:31:45.390 align:middle line:84%
They shake it off,
and then they move on,

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.765 align:middle line:84%
but humans don't
tend to do that.

00:31:46.765 --> 00:31:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to
clamp down instead.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about all the times

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%
we've had difficult
experiences that we've

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:90%
clamped down on those.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Those are all
areas of resistance

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.300 align:middle line:90%
in our electrical system.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And very often in the
course of an adjustment,

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.820 align:middle line:84%
people will feel the
need to shake or wiggle

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:84%
or start to move and
shake off that pattern

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and reset into a
more neutral one.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
go on and talk about some

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:11.820 align:middle line:90%
of the very specific ones.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Because you noticed in
these large patterns,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.110 align:middle line:84%
we're going to dig
down into boomers.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:84%
We have some boomers
watching this show right now,

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and you started seeing
generational patterns

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:22.680 align:middle line:84%
with living people,
such as the boomers.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.600 align:middle line:84%
What were you picking
up in their fields?

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, the
first group distant session

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I ever did on a group was on
boomers because a lot of them

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.140 align:middle line:84%
were my clientele, and I
started observing that they all

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:90%
had the same pattern.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So where it came from, where
it seemed to come from,

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:84%
was being bottle fed formula on
a schedule and not being held,

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.215 align:middle line:90%
not being--

00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cry it out.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, cry it out.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And so in that cry
it out thing, there

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:84%
is a belief that's formed that
it doesn't matter what I say,

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.360 align:middle line:90%
nobody's listening anyway.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Sort of like a powerlessness
around the voice.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And a sugar
addiction, a tendency

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to self-soothe
with wine or sugar.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.650 align:middle line:84%
A feeling like everybody else's
needs were more important.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So a tendency to
over-caretake, overdo,

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.310 align:middle line:84%
while being frustrated
about their own

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.700 align:middle line:84%
needs not being met and
consoling themselves

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.020 align:middle line:90%
with wine or sugar.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's inter-- I
mean, I would say you're right

00:33:23.395 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:84%
on of all the women
in my generation--

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm a boomer-- of all the women
in that generation, I'd say,

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.710 align:middle line:84%
almost without
exception, all of them--

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:84%
all the women I know
fall into those patterns.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So being
denied what you need,

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and then feeling like, OK,
you better give what you can,

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:84%
do what you can for
others, but you're

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.807 align:middle line:84%
personally not worthy or
deserving of attention.

00:33:42.807 --> 00:33:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, sugar
that's where it comes--

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.400 align:middle line:90%
cookies--

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.587 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kettle corn.

00:33:47.587 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Kettle corn.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK, let's go--

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
here, right here, the
emotional challenge

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:84%
lands in the body
beginning with the feet.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.435 align:middle line:84%
I have this here of the
various parts of the body.

00:33:58.435 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into some
of them, and I

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:01.580 align:middle line:84%
want to go back to what you
talked about a little bit ago.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.622 align:middle line:90%
We have about 10 minutes.

00:34:02.622 --> 00:34:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We can get into it--
the bacteria in us

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:90%
and the photonic light involved.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:10.219 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking about
your digestive burning process.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:13.889 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to bacteria and our
natural interface with it.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's
start with the feet.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:17.523 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: OK, so observing--

00:34:17.523 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:84%
again, working with
thousands of clients

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and observing these
patterns that the feet--

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:84%
that the left foot tended
to be an issue when

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:27.650 align:middle line:84%
we were stuck or mired in
some kind of toxic situation

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't feel we could
extract ourselves from.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I used to have
seven planters warts

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.193 align:middle line:84%
on my left foot, all kinds
of issues with my left foot

00:34:35.193 --> 00:34:36.860 align:middle line:84%
because I grew up in
a toxic environment

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't
do anything about,

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:42.449 align:middle line:84%
and so I withdrew my awareness
from that discomfort.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So without the
immune system there,

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.818 align:middle line:84%
viral warts things
like that, I'm not

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:48.860 align:middle line:84%
going to go there because
it's too uncomfortable,

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.440 align:middle line:84%
so then the body
starts to go south.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.760 align:middle line:84%
The right foot
relates more to fear,

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.120 align:middle line:90%
uncertainty moving forward.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.210 align:middle line:84%
The knees relate very
much to stuckness.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.330 align:middle line:84%
The left knee is holding
on to the devil you know.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.280 align:middle line:84%
The right knee is
being blocked moving--

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So moving
forward is an issue there.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, yep.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
The left hip relates to
frustration over unmet needs.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Things we want to be doing,
being, or having but we're not.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who struggle
with body image issues

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and things like that or who are
over-caretaking others and not

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:90%
meeting their own needs.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.300 align:middle line:84%
The right hip relates
to guilt-driven,

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:90%
overthinking, and overdoing.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.600 align:middle line:90%
A lot of that going on.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a lot.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: A lot
of that going on.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.552 align:middle line:84%
Getting out ahead of yourself,
to-do lists, things like that.

00:35:33.552 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Go, go, go, do, do, do.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.550 align:middle line:84%
The left side of
the solar plexus

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.620 align:middle line:90%
relates to powerlessness.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.830 align:middle line:84%
The right side to anger,
which are both misuse--

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.020 align:middle line:84%
like the powerlessness
is a kind of freeze.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:45.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of--

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.438 align:middle line:84%
in fact, there's
a whole thing that

00:35:47.438 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:84%
goes from the solar plexus
on the left side down

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:84%
into the left hip that I call
the posture of victimhood,

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.700 align:middle line:84%
where we're feeling
powerless, unheard,

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and frustrated because our
needs aren't being met.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:84%
When we're in victim
consciousness,

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:84%
it's all very much scrunching
down into this left hip.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:84%
The left shoulder is
sadness, grief and loss.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.260 align:middle line:84%
The right shoulder is
saying yes when we mean no.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Putting other people's
needs ahead of our own,

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:13.670 align:middle line:84%
being a caretaker
and accommodator.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.710 align:middle line:90%
I have a girlfriend who--

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:19.190 align:middle line:84%
single mom, has a whole bunch
of jobs, runs a massage school--

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.410 align:middle line:84%
went hiking and fell
and injured herself.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And she called me and she
said, I fell and got an injury.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Guess where it is?

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.310 align:middle line:90%
And I said, right shoulder?

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.400 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Very predictable.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So even when we get
injuries or accidents,

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.325 align:middle line:84%
they tend to happen
in the places

00:36:32.325 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:84%
where our biofield
is out of balance.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's a consequence
of our energy

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.690 align:middle line:84%
not running through the
center of our being.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.675 align:middle line:90%
We're off spinning out here.

00:36:40.675 --> 00:36:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Speaking of the
center of our being, what

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.900 align:middle line:90%
about the spine?

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well, the
spine has to do with--

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and it depends on where it is--

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where in the spine.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Where it is.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Right, so upper back tends
to be the classic carrying

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.600 align:middle line:90%
the burdens of the world.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Mid-back is very often
related to feeling

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:90%
like nobody's got your back.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.510 align:middle line:84%
That's very often
martyrs and people

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:84%
who do everything and do too
much end up with mid-back pain.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Low back pain is often related
to intimate relationships

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.877 align:middle line:90%
and financial status.

00:37:11.877 --> 00:37:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so
when you're talking

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:84%
about all of these
characteristics

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.240 align:middle line:84%
of the right and left side and
these different even organs,

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:84%
is this true whether
you're male or female?

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Is this a universal
truth for humans?

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Gender is not attached to this.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: It
doesn't appear to be.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.830 align:middle line:84%
This is just a sort of
generalized observation.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you,
Regina, as I was

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.440 align:middle line:84%
mapping this and discovering
it, I had doubt about it

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.100 align:middle line:90%
for a really long time.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.670 align:middle line:84%
But then when you see
something thousands of times

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and you see a pattern
over and over,

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and then my students started
finding the same things,

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:49.400 align:middle line:84%
it does appear to be a
kind of universal map.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.060 align:middle line:84%
In this model, our body is
inside our mind rather than

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.270 align:middle line:90%
the other way around.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when our mind
goes out of balance,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.063 align:middle line:90%
it brings our body with it.

00:37:58.063 --> 00:37:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the
mind is what surrounding

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.310 align:middle line:90%
and permeating--

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: That's right--

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The body,

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.257 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Exactly, so in
this model, the biofield,

00:38:03.257 --> 00:38:05.860 align:middle line:84%
what we call a biofield,
the body's electrical system

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.620 align:middle line:84%
is our conscious mind,
it's our subconscious mind,

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:84%
but I would also
call it our soul.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And in this way,
our understanding

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:84%
of the electrical body bridges
the science and spirituality.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
times when people

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.720 align:middle line:84%
have an experience of their
own inner illumination,

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.410 align:middle line:84%
the only framework they have
to apply it to is religious.

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you have an
understanding that

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.080 align:middle line:84%
this is part of your
biological reality--

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.297 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: That
you are electric,

00:38:32.297 --> 00:38:35.350 align:middle line:84%
that you do have an
inner light, then

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.405 align:middle line:84%
that becomes both
spiritual and scientific.

00:38:38.405 --> 00:38:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Spirit permeating the flesh.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yes.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, we talked about
bacteria for just--

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.765 align:middle line:84%
I just want to spend
a little more time

00:38:45.765 --> 00:38:49.060 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
have digestive upsets now.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Digestive orders
galore, especially

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.890 align:middle line:84%
it seems more among
females than males even.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what's
going on there, because we

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:84%
have this wonderful bacteria
with all this photonic light.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.057 align:middle line:84%
How are we suppressing
its effective workings?

00:39:04.057 --> 00:39:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: We think there's
a lot going on there.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I've discovered

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:84%
is that the bacterial
balance in our gut is tonal,

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:14.270 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
Candida, which tends

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to happen in people--
it was my own health

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
issue that got me caring more
about my health was Candida.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.310 align:middle line:84%
That when you're depressed and
you turn your anger inwards

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:84%
with self-soothing with sugar,
that creates that undertone,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.500 align:middle line:90%
uhh--

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.630 align:middle line:90%
that's Candida's jam.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Candida digs that tone.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And it will proliferate in
the tonal valley of depression

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.700 align:middle line:90%
with a steady diet of sugar.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, interesting.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: So our gut
bacteria is really an orchestra

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and is responsive to the
different tones that we

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.610 align:middle line:84%
express in our electric
acoustic bodies.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So the more tonally balanced
we are, the bacteria in our gut

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:90%
falls in line with that.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So even though I used to have
gas, bloating, all of that,

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't correct that
through supplementation.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I corrected it through
balancing my electrical system

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.348 align:middle line:84%
and my tonal
rhythms and outputs.

00:40:13.348 --> 00:40:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's get down
to that part of the story.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.105 align:middle line:84%
So people can do
this for themselves.

00:40:18.105 --> 00:40:19.480 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
practitioners--

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.760 align:middle line:84%
we'll get to that in a
minute-- but people can also

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.440 align:middle line:84%
use tuning forks on themselves
to balance their own field.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Is it a relatively easy thing
to do, or is it complex?

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well, last night,
I just finished up a night

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.950 align:middle line:84%
before last a five-week
course called,

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.150 align:middle line:90%
"Tune yourself into health."

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I did a live
five-week course that

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.820 align:middle line:84%
is available as an
evergreen on my website now,

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.867 align:middle line:84%
and I taught people
how to tune themselves.

00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: How to use the
tuning forks on their body

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.467 align:middle line:84%
and also how to do a
distance session on them.

00:40:48.467 --> 00:40:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's talk
about that, distance session.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.920 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how do you do a
distance session on yourself,

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.518 align:middle line:84%
and can a practitioner do
a distance session on you?

00:40:57.518 --> 00:40:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah,
well, first of all,

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.477 align:middle line:84%
let me just tell
you that I didn't

00:41:00.477 --> 00:41:02.765 align:middle line:84%
believe it was possible to
do this work at a distance.

00:41:02.765 --> 00:41:05.140 align:middle line:84%
People asked me for years,
can you do this at a distance?

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.360 align:middle line:90%
And I was always like, no.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.760 align:middle line:84%
This is sound waves on
the body, like how would I

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:90%
do it at a distance?

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
arrogant about it.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But then I had a friend who was
a doctor, an MD in California,

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and he convinced me
to try one on him.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm a researcher.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.020 align:middle line:90%
I like experiments.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.603 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK,
I'll give it a try.

00:41:23.603 --> 00:41:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did
was I pretended

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:84%
that he was on my
treatment table,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and we had no open
lines of communication.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I approached the
table as if he was there.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And much to my amazement,
all the information

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.120 align:middle line:84%
that shows up around an actual
body showed up on my table,

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to go through
and read his whole field.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
your whole life story.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like dropping
a needle on an album

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and reading the vibrational
record of your life.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.775 align:middle line:84%
So I could tell what
ages he had trouble,

00:41:52.775 --> 00:41:54.080 align:middle line:90%
the personality of his mom--

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you did
me, you were right on.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.550 align:middle line:90%
You hit every critical point.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, all of
that information showed up.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have any
open line of communication.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.177 align:middle line:84%
So when I was done,
we got on the phone.

00:42:02.177 --> 00:42:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And I went through my notes.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.483 align:middle line:84%
He said, Eileen, that's
all exactly correct.

00:42:05.483 --> 00:42:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and I
experienced a state change,

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.120 align:middle line:90%
like I feel different.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.330 align:middle line:90%
I felt you working on me.

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:90%
I was like, get out of town.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.640 align:middle line:90%
I guess I have to eat my words.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How far back that?

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: That was 2011.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for
the last 10 years,

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.207 align:middle line:84%
have you been working
on people at a distance,

00:42:20.207 --> 00:42:21.680 align:middle line:90%
but you've also trained others?

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.055 align:middle line:84%
The people you train also know
how to work at a distance?

00:42:24.055 --> 00:42:26.555 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yes, every single
biofield training practitioner

00:42:26.555 --> 00:42:28.080 align:middle line:84%
learns to do the
work at a distance.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we just
completed a study last year,

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:34.280 align:middle line:84%
where we had 15 volunteers who
received three biofield tuning

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.640 align:middle line:84%
sessions, one a week at a
distance for three weeks.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.830 align:middle line:84%
All of the volunteers
had clinical anxiety

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:41.750 align:middle line:84%
coming into the study,
and none of them

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.310 align:middle line:90%
had clinical anxiety going out.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have such great
statements from them

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and forms that they filled out
that show that the anxiety was

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.260 align:middle line:84%
here, and it went down there
in just three distant sessions.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Now those are with
talking to a practitioner.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.580 align:middle line:90%
That's how we do them.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's
absolutely possible.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:01.740 align:middle line:90%
How is it possible?

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would say that it's
ultimately it's all one field.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So a unified field
of consciousness.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, the unified
field of consciousness.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And our audience is
very comfortable with that.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, everybody's--

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
have to explain it.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.190 align:middle line:90%
They get it.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So now if someone wants
to connect with this

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and try to do some healing
through this system

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that you've created,
this biofield tuning,

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.420 align:middle line:84%
how would they find
a practitioner?

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well, the
website, biofieldtuning.com,

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.610 align:middle line:90%
you can find a practitioner.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:27.027 align:middle line:84%
We've got them all
over the world.

00:43:27.027 --> 00:43:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But you can get
it at a distance,

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.830 align:middle line:90%
which is super useful.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.830 align:middle line:84%
We also have an online
certification program.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:37.100 align:middle line:84%
COVID forced us to take our
in-person classes and turn it

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:37.930 align:middle line:90%
into a virtual--

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Silver lining.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.160 align:middle line:90%
More people can do it now.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: From
all over the world,

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.567 align:middle line:84%
and it's a better
training program

00:43:42.567 --> 00:43:44.330 align:middle line:84%
because we've made
a bunch of videos.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:45.475 align:middle line:90%
And it's just better.

00:43:45.475 --> 00:43:46.850 align:middle line:84%
We're turning out
better students

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.470 align:middle line:84%
now than we did
before with virtual,

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't think that
was possible either.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm eating my words on that too.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:54.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know a few
people in my community

00:43:54.245 --> 00:43:56.030 align:middle line:84%
found you through my
interview at Gaia.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They joined my
personal community,

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and they were always
reflecting back about you.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're just ecstatic
about what they're

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.830 align:middle line:84%
learning because I
think one or two of them

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.140 align:middle line:84%
are practitioners
now, and they just

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:84%
find it a really
profound way to heal.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: It is such a
rewarding practice to do.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have to tell you,
the forks are fascinating.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:90%
The field is fascinating.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've
got one right here.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:90%
This is your newest one.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.460 align:middle line:90%
This is your invention.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And you said it takes
the natural frequency,

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and you upped it,
what, nine times?

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Well, it's
the Schumann resonance.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Schumann
resonance, yeah.

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.808 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: So the baseline
Schumann resonance,

00:44:24.808 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:90%
which is around 7.83 Hertz.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I
multiplied it times 12.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: So that
fork is 93.9 Hertz.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.703 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have a
7.83 Hertz tuning fork

00:44:35.703 --> 00:44:37.370 align:middle line:84%
because it would be
like four feet long.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:39.893 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: So that
Schumann resonance,

00:44:39.893 --> 00:44:41.810 align:middle line:84%
that electrical background
pulse of the Earth,

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:90%
is embedded in that fork.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when you activate it
and you put it on yourself--

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.158 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You did that
to me before we came on.

00:44:48.158 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, it was like manna.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Just that frequency resonating
near the hypothalamus,

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:53.840 align:middle line:90%
oh my god.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah, it
feels really good.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It feels really good.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.755 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say
something else,

00:44:56.755 --> 00:44:59.690 align:middle line:84%
you've been also doing
this and teaching people

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to use this for
their bodies and even

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.750 align:middle line:84%
for their skin regeneration and
such and muscular regeneration,

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.620 align:middle line:84%
of which you've done
a ton on yourself.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yes.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there are a
lot of ways to apply it,

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:12.170 align:middle line:84%
but you have to go to your
site and find out that--

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:13.712 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah,
all different ways.

00:45:13.712 --> 00:45:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Beauty-- it helps reduce visible
lines on some people, tone

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.920 align:middle line:90%
muscle, lose weight.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.063 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody.

00:45:20.063 --> 00:45:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has
different responses.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's a really
useful little self

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:24.938 align:middle line:90%
tool, self-care tool.

00:45:24.938 --> 00:45:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And like
you explained when

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.605 align:middle line:84%
we're talking behind the
scenes, it's a bell curve.

00:45:28.605 --> 00:45:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't really
pick up much at all

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:31.610 align:middle line:90%
by wave frequencies.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Others are like everything's
changing by the second,

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and everyone falls somewhere
on that bell curve.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's like anything, there's
no one single bullet in life.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But for some people,
it's a bullet.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.150 align:middle line:90%
For other people, it's not.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.760 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
play with it and try.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So finally, Eileen, in
all this work you've done,

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.590 align:middle line:84%
everything you've come
to, all this research,

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:52.950 align:middle line:84%
what is the most profound
learning you've had out of it?

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: That
everyone is great.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.170 align:middle line:84%
That every single
person is amazing

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful and
brilliant and gifted.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And that everybody
knows that deep down,

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.580 align:middle line:84%
but there's a whole
bunch of junk in the way.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And that Marianne
Williamson quote

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.750 align:middle line:84%
about how it's our
light they we're afraid

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:15.020 align:middle line:84%
of more than anything
is really, really true.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.550 align:middle line:84%
That what gets in
the way of people

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:18.170 align:middle line:90%
experiencing their greatness--

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I saw it in other
people for 10 years.

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:22.180 align:middle line:90%
I work on people.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.680 align:middle line:10%
And when you get the noise out
of the signal and the harmony

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.230 align:middle line:10%
that's underneath comes up--
because our factory settings

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:28.100 align:middle line:10%
are for harmony.

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.293 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: And for harmony
with the natural world

00:46:31.293 --> 00:46:32.900 align:middle line:90%
and connection.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.540 align:middle line:10%
And when you bring up
that beauty, all of that

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.800 align:middle line:10%
comes to the surface.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.840 align:middle line:10%
And I saw that in
people for 10 years.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, it dawned
on me, I'm like oh my god,

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.080 align:middle line:84%
if everybody is great,
then I must be too.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.753 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
hard to accept that.

00:46:47.753 --> 00:46:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't that to
accept your own light.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKUSICK: Really, it's
strangely hard to do that.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.230 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you what,
everybody's got it,

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and so everybody should accept
it because it's just the truth.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And the tuning forks
bring up that part of you.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm looking
forward to experiencing that

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.590 align:middle line:90%
again very, very soon.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Eileen, for
joining us again and bringing

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.350 align:middle line:84%
us forward into what you've
learned over the last few years

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and your new inventions
and everything else.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I know our audience
really appreciates it.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:13.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKUSICK: Awesome.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:14.873 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:47:14.873 --> 00:47:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope this
has been helpful for you

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.185 align:middle line:84%
in the age of emotional
and spiritual burnout.

00:47:19.185 --> 00:47:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm personally really
excited because I

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:23.510 align:middle line:84%
have a session from Eileen
coming up this afternoon.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure she's going to be
back here with us though

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:27.620 align:middle line:84%
for another conversation
as we've barely

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:28.820 align:middle line:90%
scratched the surface.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.000 align:middle line:10%
Again, her book is "Electric
Body, Electric Health,"

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.140 align:middle line:10%
and you can find her by
going to biofieldtuning.com.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
