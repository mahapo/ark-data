00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:21.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I have often asked,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.610 align:middle line:10%
where are the
great philosophers,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:10%
now that we really,
really need them?

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've often thought, probably
reincarnated on Wall Street

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:84%
after starving to death in their
past life as a philosopher.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe not--

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Tim Freke is a
modern-day philosopher.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And he is making the bigger
vision of who and what we are

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:84%
as human beings both
entertaining and approachable,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
because we cannot afford to
continue avoiding looking

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
at what we are and what
we're contributing to life,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:84%
to this planet,
and to the cosmos.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
We've got to start
looking at ourselves,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
looking at our motives, and
that's what you guys are paid--

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:90%
or not paid--

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM FREKE: Yeah.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.465 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, everything comes
from what we think this is.

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But nobody's really
thinking about that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:90%
except the philosophers.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: I know.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When my son chose
to major in philosophy,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
everyone else was so
oh, I'm so sorry, right,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:90%
knowing he'd starve to death.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
We need philosophers
right now to really start

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:84%
considering what the stage of
our evolution is as a species

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.072 align:middle line:84%
and what we can do with this,
where we can go with it.

00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what you're
charging yourself with.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.113 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Absolutely.

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:10%
It feels like a
lot of people feel

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:10%
that humanity's lost its way--

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It has--

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:10%
>>FREKE: And I-- yeah,
because the choice on offer

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:10%
traditionally now or it has been
between religion, which often

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:10%
seems irrational, outdated.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of we don't
think the universe was

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:90%
collated in seven days anymore.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.348 align:middle line:90%
We've done that.

00:01:50.348 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got this
new thing, science,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
which is so powerful
but literally soulless.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.555 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't speak to the
meaning of what life is.

00:01:57.555 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
speak to anyone's heart.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: It doesn't.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I have a huge respect for
it, but it only goes so far.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
looking for what's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
going to fill that
hole in the middle.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've been exploring
spirituality all my life,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:90%
from a very young age.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And as I've got older,
I've wondered, how can we

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:84%
get to the essence of this and
then frame it in such a way

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't become
on the edges of culture?

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
It can come right
into the middle,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:90%
and it can speak to science.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So scientific knowledge
of spiritual wisdom

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
can become part of
one thing, rather than

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:90%
seemingly in opposition.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number of
people, aside from yourself,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
who are also charging
themselves with this.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And we need an army
of philosophers

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that can speak the language
of any different demographic

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and to each culture
of the world.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
ways to frame this.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Not only
many ways to frame it,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:90%
but also, it's not easy.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.807 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: That's why
it hasn't been done.

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:10%
>>FREKE: Go back to Einstein
and great scientists,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:10%
Niels Bohr, the people who've
created modern science.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:10%
And they also felt that
bringing these two things

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.873 align:middle line:10%
together was the great
intellectual challenge

00:03:16.873 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:10%
of our time, because
it would completely

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:10%
change how we see reality and
then how we live our lives.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.035 align:middle line:90%
But it's not easy to do.

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:84%
There are challenges
to make it happen.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not easy to do.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're
in an environment--

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.172 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Rupert
Sheldrake about a year ago.

00:03:29.172 --> 00:03:30.130 align:middle line:10%
>>FREKE: Great example.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he's
a good example of it.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:10%
And in the newest
book he had written,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:10%
we were talking
about the statistics

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:10%
in it, that the world is now--

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:10%
England, in
particular, but also,

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:10%
actually surprisingly,
the US less so.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.180 align:middle line:84%
But all of the Western
world is really now

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.547 align:middle line:90%
in a state of majority atheist.

00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Definitely.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in England,
I think it's only--

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:84%
oh gosh, it's something
like 80%, 85%.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Definitely--

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: I'm
optimistic about that.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
"atheism," I'm not

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.373 align:middle line:84%
talking about going back
to fundamental religions.

00:04:06.373 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: It's secular.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's secular.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's no purchase
in anything unseen.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it's more based
on scientific materialism,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
although there is a kind
of spirituality that

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
can emerge alongside it
and can rise out of it.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.248 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, it's a materialistic
engagement with life.

00:04:24.248 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: There's massive
wonder in science.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.218 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots
of TV programs--

00:04:28.218 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:84%
in England, Brian
Cox and people like

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
this-- who are looking
at the universe

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:90%
and go, look at the wonder.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Look at the wonder.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:90%
And god, it is wonderful.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But the small print with
that philosophy is oh,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:84%
but by the way,
you're a clever monkey

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
clinging to a rock
for a few short years.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all
this is random.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And then there's
no purpose to your life,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.280 align:middle line:90%
and you're gone.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: So that's a
very, very bleak view--

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very bleak--

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Which pushes
people into a kind

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:90%
of short-term materialism.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and which I
think is where we are right now.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: It is.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: But because I'm an
evolutionist, I think it's OK.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I think what's happening is
that this very limited but deep

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
materialist science has cleared
away a previous phase, where

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
we were superstitious
and irrational.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's true because it's in
the book and all that stuff.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's cleared
away, especially not

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:84%
so much in the US but
definitely Europe.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:90%
And then it doesn't stop there.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we need
is the next phase.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And what I think can come next
is a rational spirituality.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And by "rational."

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I just mean that it's
actually trans-rational.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It embraces thinking clearly.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You mean "explicable."

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yeah.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:90%
It thinks clearly.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It asks questions,
and it believes

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.153 align:middle line:90%
things for good reasons.

00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you almost have to
go through that painful process

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.160 align:middle line:84%
of living through the
vacuum and finding out

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
how empty it is to just keep
filling our life with more

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: That's
what's happening.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And what
I see in the States

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:90%
is that you have all of it.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:84%
You've still got the kind
of mythic religious stage.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huge fundamentalism.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Yeah, all
of that stronger

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
than we have it,
because it was involved

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:90%
in forming the country.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
wonderful secular science.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:90%
We're leading the world.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
other thing growing,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
particularly here, which is this
thoughtful, deep spirituality,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:90%
which I think's the future.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:90%
I think this is coming.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How is this
happening for you in England?

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.387 align:middle line:90%
How do people respond?

00:06:18.387 --> 00:06:20.678 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: We have less of the
problem of fundamentalism,

00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:22.722 align:middle line:84%
and we have less of the
new thing coming through.

00:06:22.722 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Or how do they respond?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:84%
How do they respond to you,
to these messages in England

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:90%
and Europe in particular?

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: For my own experiences,
I have a fantastic response.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that is because
what I try to do is honor--

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.133 align:middle line:90%
I'm not putting down science.

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, look,
there's something more.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And if I do it in a
clear way and I do it

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.610 align:middle line:84%
in a way which makes sense to
people's actual experience,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
people pick up on it.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And what I'm
loving is especially

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:90%
sharing that with young people.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Often, people are
scientists, young scientists,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:84%
who are going, actually,
what you're saying,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:90%
that actually makes sense.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.083 align:middle line:90%
And that's really exciting.

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you find that
in dealing with a younger

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:84%
generation that is now coming up
through the educational system

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and so forth,
millennials and younger,

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.413 align:middle line:84%
there is a different type
of language or yearning

00:07:16.413 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:84%
that's occurring that really
is almost becoming more

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
heart-centered, being driven
by a more heart-centered need

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:84%
to connect, to connect
not just the pieces,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
but also to connect
with each other,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the planet,
just more heart-centered?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yeah.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:84%
People often--
mistakenly, in my view--

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
see the growth of social
media and the internet

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.382 align:middle line:90%
as about lack of connection.

00:07:40.382 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at it with
the young people I know,

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.303 align:middle line:90%
and they're totally connected.

00:07:44.303 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:84%
They're connected
when they're together.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:84%
They're connected when
they're not together.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:90%
They're just connected.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like, oh, we're
entering the age of connection.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually, we're in it.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we can understand
it well enough,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:84%
if we can articulate these
deep perennial spiritual truths

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:84%
in a new way for our own
time, then I think very soon,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:84%
this new thing will
start to emerge.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.990 align:middle line:84%
My own feeling--
maybe it's too much.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But my own intuition,
for what it's worth,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.352 align:middle line:84%
is that this new
understanding that's

00:08:16.352 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:84%
coming, that I'm trying to be
a part of and so many of us,

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it will
be as big a shift

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
for human culture as
the evolution of science

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.643 align:middle line:90%
was 400 years ago.

00:08:25.643 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I should think so.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.268 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And if you look back
now and imagine taking Isaac

00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:10%
Newton or any of those founding
individuals of that and showing

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:10%
them this--

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:10%
the internet, Gaia TV, me
flying in in a great big metal

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:10%
box from England across
the Atlantic Ocean--

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.172 align:middle line:10%
these are unthinkable things,
which we take for granted.

00:08:45.172 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a
bigger jump will come.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to
be about technology.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
That's a continuation
of the old thing.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: It's going
to be about what

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.810 align:middle line:84%
we see this is, what we
see life actually is,

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.877 align:middle line:84%
and what we see death is and
what we see meaning is about.

00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
I think will just

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:84%
transform our vision of
what it is to be human.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And then once that changes,
our behavior will change.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And then a whole
new world opens up.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.397 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
the underpinnings of it

00:09:09.397 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
is to begin exploring the
true nature of reality,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.420 align:middle line:84%
but understanding it from a
psychospiritual point of view,

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:84%
the true nature of reality and
how all of this comes together

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.465 align:middle line:84%
and functions and
works to begin with,

00:09:21.465 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:84%
which takes an incredibly
open mind, meaning people

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.960 align:middle line:84%
have to start really cutting
from the dogma of both science

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and religion to be
able to be free enough

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:90%
to bring those parts together.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem we've
had so far is dogmatism.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.882 align:middle line:84%
And we've just
been experiencing,

00:09:37.882 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:84%
as we go through this really
critical point, a little

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.680 align:middle line:84%
more dogmatism lately on
both sides, drawing apart.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: I've been recently
with some absolutely the

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:90%
top neuroscientists.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's shocking at how
unsophisticated philosophically

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.432 align:middle line:84%
they are, even though
they're brilliant scientists.

00:09:57.432 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And the job has to be--

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.932 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my job
in the middle here

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
is I'm asking science to keep
its essence, but to change.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking spirituality to
keep its essence and to change.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I think we
can hold this together

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
with the biggest idea I think
that human beings have had

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:84%
ever, which is
this understanding,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
we now have that the whole
universe has evolved.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the foundation, I think,
to bring everything together.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And to that point, when
you're talking about some

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:84%
of the new science
coming out, I experienced

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%
something that was a really
wonderfully bridging experience

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
between the world of science
and the world of spirituality.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's a new technology
that a woman, who's

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
deeply spiritual but she's
an Italian neuroscientist,

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:84%
created technology,
just a device,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of
neuromodulation devices.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's more refined.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And it operates
faster in real time.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And so as I'm going
through these little games,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.100 align:middle line:90%
I had a little headset on.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
You're using your
mind-- it's wireless--

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
to play with your
computer screen

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and change the reality on
the screen with your mind.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening in real time.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But what I noticed was the only
things that actually spiked

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.770 align:middle line:84%
your levels of performance
to super coherent

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:90%
were the feelings.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't your intention.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move that thing.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
You had to have an
intention that was clear.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:84%
But it was driven by the
feeling of love or gratitude.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Very specific kind of high
virtues of the spiritual world

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
would drive it into the
state of complete coherence.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:90%
And boom, boom, boom.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, your brain really
starts essentially creating

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:84%
new neural networks and
raising its functionality.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.320 align:middle line:90%
But it was the two together.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:10%
>>FREKE: So I would
say the essential idea

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:10%
in the philosophy--

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:10%
I call it "unividualism," which
is in my book, "Soul Story"--

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:10%
is that literally
everything has evolved.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the fundamental mantra.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything is the realization of
potentiality in deeper and more

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:90%
emergent ways.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the hypothesis, so
that you can see the simplest

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:90%
things start first.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So I love the current
scientific vision.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:84%
13.8 billion years
ago, all there

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:90%
is is hydrogen and helium.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And that has become you and me
here, talking to each other,

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
through a steady process of
the realization of greater

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:90%
and greater potentialities.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.877 align:middle line:90%
That's what the universe is.

00:12:26.877 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a self-realizing process.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.908 align:middle line:84%
So what's the most
emergent thing?

00:12:32.908 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, I think
the most emergent thing--

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:90%
the scientists would agree--

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:84%
is this experience
we're having of psyche,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.403 align:middle line:84%
of a non-material realm of
ideas, which we're all having.

00:12:42.403 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, the "psyche,"
that's a Greek word.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:90%
It means "soul."

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:90%
This is the soul.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So even scientists
would agree, oh, we've

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.360 align:middle line:90%
gone from hydrogen to the soul.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.520 align:middle line:84%
We've gone from basic matter to
something not made of matter.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:90%
And where is it?

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't even exist in space.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the highest
thing in that, I think,

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
is the attention, consciousness,
and the love element

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:90%
that you mentioned.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:90%
What--

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Put
those two together,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's an incredibly
cohesive driving force.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And what I think
this can explain is why.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
interested in, because it

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:90%
seems to me the cutting edge.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
We've arrived at
psyche, at soul.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.700 align:middle line:90%
And then we're conscious.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:90%
We've got intention.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.548 align:middle line:84%
And then what's happening is
that people are waking up--

00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and this is what the
deep spiritual message

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.990 align:middle line:84%
is-- to the fact that
actually, they're

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.835 align:middle line:90%
one with the whole universe.

00:13:32.835 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They're moving from what
I call "individuals"

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to "unividuals,"
who are individuals

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:90%
conscious that everything's one.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
with this oneness,

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:90%
there's this enormous love.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
motivates me and has

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
done since I was a little boy
is oh my god, I can wake up.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm one with universe, and
there's this incredible love.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So that looks to me like where
the whole process of evolution

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:90%
has led.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you're sitting
there doing that process

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking
loving attention--

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're watching
through a physical device

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:90%
the effects on the screen--

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: You're seeing
what that does--

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you see the results.

00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: So you're seeing, ah.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to do is bring
the most emergent quality

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, the
place it's all led to,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:84%
which is loving attention,
to all the issues we face.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And that's the
kind of sociological message

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.253 align:middle line:90%
of this evolutionary philosophy.

00:14:21.253 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like OK, this is
where we've got to.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
We're changing from
individuals to "unividuals."

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.072 align:middle line:90%
It's really happening a lot.

00:14:28.072 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
hard for a lot of people,

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of times, people
who are brought into especially

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the Eastern
traditions, for example,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
are taking comfort in the notion
that they're not individuated,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
that they're just
a drop in the sea,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and want to go back to becoming
just a drop in the hole,

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:84%
without an individuated
I would say

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.410 align:middle line:84%
not only consciousness but
sense of responsibility

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: OK.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm asking
science to move,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm asking
spirituality to move.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So with science,
what I'm saying is,

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:84%
look, with the current
evolutionary story, which

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:84%
is immense, it goes up
to the evolution of life.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
this side effect

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:90%
we call the "soul," the psyche.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying to
science, no, no, no.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole other
phase of evolution,

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.060 align:middle line:84%
which is the evolution of
the soul, which spirituality

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:90%
has always been about.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't end the story.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:90%
The story's one story.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:90%
It reaches further.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:84%
If we can see that, then we
can make it one understanding.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Then to spirituality,
most ancient spirituality

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:90%
works with the myth of the fall.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything was great, and
then we fell into life.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:90%
We're trapped in the body.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:90%
The life is an illusion.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a bad thing.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Even your individuality is in
the way of you, like a drop,

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:90%
going back to the ocean--

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:90%
totally anti-life.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.423 align:middle line:90%
It's a negative view.

00:15:47.423 --> 00:15:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: It's just an old view.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: There was a
time it was cutting-edge.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
By getting rid of
that idea of the fall

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and replacing it with this
beautiful optimistic story

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:90%
of evolution, of emergence--

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.417 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But not evolution
as we know it from Darwinism.

00:16:03.417 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:10%
>>FREKE: Darwinism--

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Darwinism--

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:10%
>>FREKE: Darwinism
and also Wallace,

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.860 align:middle line:10%
it was incredible insight that
what they saw was all of life

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:10%
had evolved from a simple cell.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:90%
What a vision.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:84%
How that happens, we're
still working it out

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:90%
and all the rest of it.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:90%
But it looks like it's happened.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:90%
What a mind-blowing vision.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:90%
All of life is one thing.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:10%
And then 100 years ago, with
big bang theory, oh my god.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:10%
There's a whole 10 billion
years before that, in which

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.300 align:middle line:10%
the whole universe has evolved.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.175 align:middle line:10%
But there's no
Darwinism in then.

00:16:37.175 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:10%
That's a different process.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.368 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
the ancient mysteries.

00:16:40.368 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
It's everything evolved once a
template was set into motion.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yeah.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That gets
more complicated then.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: It does.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And my own understanding
of how that process works

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
is to do with the
nature of time.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.743 align:middle line:84%
So when I study time
experientially, as well as

00:16:59.743 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:84%
philosophically,
I look at it now.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:90%
And I go, oh, it's interesting.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:84%
Every moment I've
ever experienced

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:90%
has got two qualities.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
One, it realizes a
new potentiality,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
the universe is.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It's always realizing,
oh, this is new.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:90%
Never had this before.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:84%
And also-- and this
is the key bit--

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
every moment includes within
it implicitly everything that's

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
ever happened so that without
you inviting me to have

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
this conversation, without me
flying from England, without us

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
learning to speak English, the
evolution of the human form,

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:84%
the big bang,
everything that's ever

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.130 align:middle line:84%
happened to us or
in the universe

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.700 align:middle line:90%
is implicit in this moment.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.970 align:middle line:90%
So the past hasn't passed.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:90%
The past has accumulated.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:84%
There's more and
more and more of it.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is, I think, what
Rupert Sheldrake is onto,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of the
presence of the past,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.427 align:middle line:84%
that everything that's happening
is the habits of nature.

00:17:49.427 --> 00:17:50.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
informing the field.

00:17:50.885 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: It's informing
what's happening now,

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
because the past is
actually present.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So the template, I think,
is itself evolving.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:90%
And that template is the past.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And quite possibly, my own
intuition would be probably

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
even with the beginning
of this universe,

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:84%
there was already the past
of other universes, which

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
is why the great
puzzle is, how come

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:84%
everything set up so perfectly
for us when it starts?

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think the answer
is because it's not

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:90%
the first universe.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So the template
itself is the past,

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and we're creating
that template now.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:90%
You're changing my thoughts.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm changing your thoughts.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.375 align:middle line:84%
People who are
listening to this,

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:90%
we're all moving together.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So as the past accumulates,
we're all growing.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the soul evolution.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
all evolution is.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
But for us, it's happening
on this non-material level

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:90%
of psyche, of soul.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.518 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you made
mention of something

00:18:43.518 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the conversation,

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that you've been asking
these questions since you

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:90%
were a child.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But you actually had
an event as a child.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's just get into
that so people know what

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:90%
spawned all of this in you.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yeah.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about ideas here.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm a philosopher.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:90%
I love ideas.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:84%
But actually,
underneath all of that,

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm a love junkie, because what
happened to me that started me

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:84%
off on this, when I
was a kid, life always

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.828 align:middle line:90%
seemed profoundly mysterious.

00:19:07.828 --> 00:19:08.628 align:middle line:90%
It still does.

00:19:08.628 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I wake up with it every morning.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:90%
What is this thing?

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.290 align:middle line:90%
What shall I do with it?

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.278 align:middle line:84%
All of those-- and I had
this as a little boy.

00:19:15.278 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't understand
why all the grown-ups weren't

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:18.557 align:middle line:90%
asking that question.

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I still don't understand why all
the grown-ups aren't asking--

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that
you are kind of one?

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Kind of one, yeah.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And something happened to
me, just sitting on a hill,

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:84%
looking at this little town
I grew up in in England,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:90%
in the southwest.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced what I now
think of as being deep awake.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
There was a shift in me,
and the world came to life.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And there was this profound
oneness with everything.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:84%
The sensuality was
just turned up.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest thing I
remember very vividly,

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.113 align:middle line:84%
because I actually wrote about
it straightaway, as well,

00:19:51.113 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
as a boy, was this
enormous love.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.952 align:middle line:84%
Now, I now know this is a
common experience that people

00:19:56.952 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:90%
have been experiencing this--

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.243 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some would call
it "kundalini awakening"

00:20:00.243 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:90%
or any number of names.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: All these different
names and in different flavors.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's fundamentally
this, oh, it's all one.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And there's this love.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So my life really has
been followed from that.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.160 align:middle line:90%
It's been like, what happened?

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:90%
How can I get back there?

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:90%
How can I understand it?

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:90%
How can I cultivate it?

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:90%
And then how can I share it?

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So have you
gotten back there?

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: All the time, but not
in some oh, I'm enlightened--

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not in this
profound, out of control, way.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: One thing I'm
not comfortable with is

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
the idea that we arrive at an
end place, where we're done.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, tick.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I've got the hat,
got the T-shirt.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm there.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's evolutionary.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:90%
So it gets deeper.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not linear.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Life throws up challenges,
and Tim is still Tim.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So still that little
boy-- now, he's nearly 60.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's got flaws and problems
and things he works with,

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:53.447 align:middle line:90%
like everyone else.

00:20:53.447 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to
be true of everyone.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:90%
I haven't met an exception yet.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Exactly.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's key.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: So the
way I look at it is

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that I'm waking up to this
oneness, but through Tim.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And Tim's not in the way.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no ego in me
trying to stop me,

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
which I used to believe,
because that's what I was told.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't look like that.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.852 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: It looks the opposite.

00:21:12.852 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It looks like as Tim evolves,
he can support this deeper

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:90%
realization.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And that's
what I need to do.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:84%
I need to just keep evolving
and keep going deeper.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And like you say, the
story that much of the world

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:84%
has bought into, much
of the Western world

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Judeo-Christian beliefs
and Islamic beliefs, as well,

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
often does have to do
with this fall of sorts,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:84%
this state of flawed and evil as
the natural state of humankind.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to
the new age community,

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:84%
where, no, we're all angels that
have simply chosen to reflect

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:90%
ourselves in this experience.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:90%
These are poles apart.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:90%
These are worlds apart.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: They are.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And my own feeling is I
think they're both wrong.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.562 align:middle line:84%
We chose to incarnate
into these vehicles.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: We're moving
in and out of life.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:90%
I do think that.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can understand
that really rationally

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:90%
in a way that fits with science.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we'll have a
chance to talk about that--

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we are going to--

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Because I
think that's important.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:08.717 align:middle line:84%
But I also think the
overall arc is evolutionary.

00:22:08.717 --> 00:22:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So although there's a sense
in which, oh, I'm back here,

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:90%
and this is a material state.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's in a sense a fall.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Overall, the arc
is moving forward.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And Tim is becoming more,
because the past accumulates.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're meeting
everything I've ever been.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm meeting everything
you've ever been.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:90%
So there's always more.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.820 align:middle line:90%
And so it's very optimistic.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:90%
It's full of hope.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And my experience of waking up
when I was 12 and every time it

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.777 align:middle line:84%
happens ever since is that
there's a lot of hope there.

00:22:37.777 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Despite all the terrible
suffering-- and god

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:84%
knows there's enough--
there's a fundamental goodness

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:84%
to this, because it's heading
always towards the good.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:90%
It wants to get better.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:90%
It wants to evolve.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:90%
It wants to be more.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
redeems the suffering.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:84%
We're in agreement on
that, and also that life

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
is to-- actually, I think
what gets lost in the mix

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes is this serious
search for ourselves, for soul,

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
for meaning is that we forget
that the simple acts of joy

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:84%
are really what allow that
connectedness within ourselves

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And we just kind of
toss that to the side,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.022 align:middle line:84%
because we think it means going
to the pub on a Friday night,

00:23:16.022 --> 00:23:18.640 align:middle line:84%
in the case of lot of
Brits, or whatever.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:84%
But just forgetting to connect
with the things that actually

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:84%
bring a childlike joy brings
a very high and very coherent

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.090 align:middle line:90%
state within us.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to start
talking about that.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.623 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at that from
you can talk about it

00:23:32.623 --> 00:23:34.540 align:middle line:84%
on a brain chemical point
of view or whatever.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Start stitching
science together.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.753 align:middle line:84%
What in your mind is the dance
between spirit and matter?

00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start at
the building blocks.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: I think that for
me, the way that I would

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
use these words-- and
people use the words

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:47.893 align:middle line:90%
in lots of different ways.

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I try and hone them
back etymologically

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.260 align:middle line:90%
to where they came from.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So I would see spirit or
"essence" from "esse," "to be,"

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:90%
the Latin.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It's "being."

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
formless potentiality

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:84%
which is realizing itself as
this evolving flow of form.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
timeless appearing as time.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:84%
There's something
formless evolving as form.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And it evolves in this
ever more emergent way.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So it starts as information,
which becomes matter.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
physics is studying.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And then that will
evolve over 10,000 years,

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.310 align:middle line:90%
until we reach life.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what biology is studying.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's immense.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, biology will reach
the point where it's sentient.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:84%
It can read light,
so it can see.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
It can read vibrations in
the air, so it can hear.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.410 align:middle line:90%
And it will become conscious.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.660 align:middle line:90%
It will know that it's doing it.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And that will evolve into
a whole other realm, which

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is the realm of the imagination,
images, the psyche, the soul,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:84%
the mind, what the Sufis
call the "imaginal realms."

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans call
it the "bardos."

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole realm
now we exist in,

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:90%
which is non-material.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what spirituality
has always studied.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So the dance is between all
of that, because all of that

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:90%
exists right now.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go back to
the very beginning

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:90%
and ask one question there.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably because
it's a bent of mine

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.610 align:middle line:84%
to think that way, which is,
going back to the beginning,

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:84%
going back to the
logos in prima materia,

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.750 align:middle line:84%
the way I've always viewed it
is that the logos informs prima

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
materia, just as an egg
is impregnated and turns

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:84%
into a human being, that there
is information that informs

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.530 align:middle line:90%
and then creates matter.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
that the information

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:90%
becomes the matter itself.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.340 align:middle line:90%
So logos becomes prima materia.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: I think so.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.190 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting
that we can understand

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that this solid matter, when we
get small enough, disappears.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the primordial
soup of potential.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yeah.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we end up
with information.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And what
does that mean?

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the ways that
you can see information

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.460 align:middle line:90%
is in mathematics.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:84%
We understand science
with mathematics.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is mathematics?

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.978 align:middle line:90%
What are numbers?

00:26:09.978 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Why do they have these certain
relationships with each other,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:90%
which are fixed?

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:90%
And in geometry, it's fixed.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, it's
already that way.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
You could go through
forever with numbers,

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.815 align:middle line:84%
and you keep finding prime
numbers, for instance.

00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:10%
So all of that
information-- this

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:10%
was Pythagoras's great insight.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:10%
All of that information
arises instantly.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet it has no
physical correlate.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And then that will
inform the way

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that hydrogen forms
or the quantum realm

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:84%
starts bringing
that into existence,

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:84%
which will then become
more and more complicated.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And the simple example is
that once you've got hydrogen

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.932 align:middle line:84%
and then once you've got oxygen,
well, then you can have water.

00:26:53.932 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:90%
But you can't have it before.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But now you can,
because that's H2O

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and then on and on and on
and on until you've got us.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And none of
that's gone anywhere.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like
the insight I'm

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:84%
trying to explore as a way
of healing this great split

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:84%
is to go, what if
everything is just this one

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:90%
unfolding of potentiality?

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's always based on the
past, becomes something new,

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:84%
based on the past,
becomes something new.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the new is
always more emergent.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:90%
It's always greater in some way.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the
notion of universal mind

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that has its own intention
and its own evolution,

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:84%
What's that look like, that
the universe has its own mind?

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: For me, if you went
back to my earlier books,

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
it would follow the fairly
standard spiritual idea, which

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.250 align:middle line:84%
is this is all existing
in a great mind.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:84%
That goes right back
to ancient India.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the dream of
Brahmin, dream of God,

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:90%
all of those ideas.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.282 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:52.282 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Science has come
along and gone, no, no, no.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.035 align:middle line:90%
There's no justification.

00:27:57.035 --> 00:27:59.618 align:middle line:84%
How have you explained
anything by saying,

00:27:59.618 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:90%
well, there's a big mind?

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.868 align:middle line:90%
There's God at the beginning.

00:28:01.868 --> 00:28:03.498 align:middle line:90%
You've just invented something.

00:28:03.498 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Where's that?

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And as I've got older, I've had
to take that more seriously.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
It feels like,
yeah, they're right.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.600 align:middle line:90%
They're right.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So I have a different
suggestion that I'm exploring,

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.760 align:middle line:84%
which is instead of taking the
big mind, the oneness, the god,

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
love, the intelligence,
the super intelligence,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.440 align:middle line:84%
putting that at the beginning,
I think we need to put it--

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.690 align:middle line:90%
it's not where it's come from.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.498 align:middle line:90%
I think it's where it's going.

00:28:29.498 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that big mind,
which I experience--

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I experienced it as a
little boy when I was 12.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.287 align:middle line:90%
That's how I experienced it.

00:28:34.287 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is God.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:90%
I think that's evolving.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
the universe is.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit like I
was a little embryo,

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.880 align:middle line:84%
but I evolved into
Tim and a soul.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And the same, where
the universe is

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.190 align:middle line:84%
coming from this cosmic egg,
which was the original image

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:84%
used for the big
bang by the person

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.030 align:middle line:90%
who came up with the idea--

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:58.210 align:middle line:84%
it's growing into
this cosmic mind.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:59.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's not where it started.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.848 align:middle line:10%
It's where it's
going, which is why

00:29:01.848 --> 00:29:03.390 align:middle line:10%
if you put God at
the beginning, it's

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.125 align:middle line:10%
a bit problematic, because
why is there so much suffering

00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:10%
if there's a god of love and
all those classic questions.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:14.928 align:middle line:84%
And 125 million years of
dinosaurs, what was that about?

00:29:14.928 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of these questions
which science asks-- and you

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.262 align:middle line:84%
have to go, well, it does
look a bit more random,

00:29:19.262 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it, really?

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you go, no,
no, the key insight

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
is the more emergent, the
greater, comes later--

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:90%
the greater comes later.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't start with
the most amazing thing,

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
conscious oneness,
a god of love.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:90%
It's heading towards that.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And my own intuition as my
own experience of awakening

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:84%
is that we are
contributing to that.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:48.418 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way that my
body is a communion of cells,

00:29:48.418 --> 00:29:50.460 align:middle line:84%
where all these little
individual cells have come

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.780 align:middle line:84%
together and somehow,
they're all working together

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and that one's being a nail
and that one's being a heart

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and that one's being a brain and
they're forming a bigger thing,

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:84%
in the same way, when
we wake up to oneness,

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
when we experience this
"unividuality," when we go,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.700 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm an individual,
but I'm also the universe,

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.850 align:middle line:84%
we come into a
communion of souls

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:90%
and that that's what God is.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what this big mind is.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And my own feeling's
this little cell

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:84%
here doesn't know what
it's like to be 10.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.380 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't got a clue.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
it's like to be God.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.520 align:middle line:84%
But I do think I know what
it's like to commune in God,

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.500 align:middle line:84%
because that's
this enormous love.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And so as we come into this
resonance with each other,

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.560 align:middle line:84%
as we make the next
big jump in evolution,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
we are playing a role in
bringing this greater thing

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:90%
that we serve into existence.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it has to be done
collaboratively, obviously.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:90%
It cannot happen--

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Completely.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:90%
So then we get to--

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.470 align:middle line:84%
again, this is where
we start differing

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.950 align:middle line:84%
from the Darwinian model,
in that this is not

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:55.850 align:middle line:84%
happening in a movement
toward our mere survival.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It's happening in a movement
toward our increased

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:84%
expression of creativity, of
the higher virtues, of love.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Yeah, because
the Darwinian insight--

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.240 align:middle line:84%
let's just say some form of
natural selection, however

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:90%
that actually works.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.860 align:middle line:90%
That's by biology.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's great to
understand biology.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:84%
What I think we have to do is
evolution itself is evolving.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.250 align:middle line:84%
There was no DNA to
evolve the stars.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:26.565 align:middle line:90%
There was no natural selection.

00:31:26.565 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:90%
None of that was happening.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.273 align:middle line:84%
It was a completely
different process.

00:31:29.273 --> 00:31:31.693 align:middle line:84%
All of that came into
existence with biology.

00:31:31.693 --> 00:31:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And what comes with life,
with the evolving of life,

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.700 align:middle line:90%
comes death.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's fantastic,
because death is absolutely

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:84%
essential for the evolution
of species of life,

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:84%
because it clears away the old
ones, makes room for new ones.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.188 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is everyone's
struggling to survive.

00:31:48.188 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:90%
And the ones that are good will.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.803 align:middle line:90%
Now we've got species.

00:31:51.803 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But they die, too.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: And they die, too.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they die, too.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.575 align:middle line:84%
But we're constantly renewing,
and it's got us to this.

00:31:57.575 --> 00:31:58.730 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:84%
My own hypothesis,
my own thought,

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.110 align:middle line:84%
is that evolution,
with the arriving

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:84%
of the psyche or the soul, this
non-material realm that we're

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.600 align:middle line:84%
discussing this in
now, it's no longer

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.640 align:middle line:90%
about the evolution of species.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.520 align:middle line:84%
It's now about the
evolution of individuals.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And death is a disaster
for individuals,

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:84%
which is why the psyche, being
non-material, doesn't doe.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: This is a
whole immaterial world.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So the immortal soul has
evolved from life and death,

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.390 align:middle line:84%
but we've arrived
at that level now.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're no longer about
survival and species.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:90%
That's all biological stuff.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.560 align:middle line:84%
We need to do that, but that's
way down the emergent level.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we're on to much more
interesting or higher emergent

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.710 align:middle line:84%
things, like virtue, like
love, like intelligence,

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
understanding,
wisdom, love wisdom.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do you
frame the development

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:90%
then of an individual soul?

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Right.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So I think what's happening
is that when we reach this--

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and this has been
happening for a while.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But there is a whole immaterial
realm of information.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is a really
simple analogy, but it helps.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.640 align:middle line:84%
If you get that idea that
physics has shown us,

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.627 align:middle line:84%
that everything starts
with information,

00:33:18.627 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:84%
so everything is
evolving information.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:84%
This is information
on this level.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.660 align:middle line:84%
This is information
on the soul level.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you can take a
really simple analogy,

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.922 align:middle line:84%
because we now create virtual
realities with information.

00:33:31.922 --> 00:33:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things which
is obvious with computers

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:38.810 align:middle line:84%
is if you put your information
just on the computer

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and the computer dies,
you lose the information.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:42.380 align:middle line:90%
So we don't do that.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:84%
We keep the information locally
on the computer and non-locally

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:46.943 align:middle line:90%
on the cloud.

00:33:46.943 --> 00:33:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
when the computer dies,

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.460 align:middle line:90%
information's still there.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I think the universe has done
that with us, because right

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.090 align:middle line:84%
now, you and I
exist as information

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:57.950 align:middle line:90%
on the biological level.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And we exist on
the psyche or soul

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.195 align:middle line:84%
level as non-material
information, which

00:34:03.195 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:84%
means when the body dies, the
information is still there.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So I would phrase the life after
death question in this way,

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.270 align:middle line:84%
that what I think
spirituality is saying

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is when the body dies, our
experience of sensation

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:84%
will stop, because
that's a body experience.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But the experience we're
having of this other realm,

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.989 align:middle line:84%
of imagination, of
soul, that doesn't stop.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And we go deeper into what
the Australian indigenous

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.190 align:middle line:84%
people call the "dreaming,"
the bardos, the Duat.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.010 align:middle line:90%
There are 1,000 names for it.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.822 align:middle line:84%
Just like we do in dreams, when
we withdraw our sensations,

00:34:42.822 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:90%
we go deeper into that realm.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Same when the body
dies-- that will cease,

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:90%
but the imagination continues.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I love about studying
near-death experiences

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:84%
is they look like these
most amazing dreams.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.845 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
are, but not unreal.

00:34:56.845 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:84%
We think of dreams as that,
but they're not unreal.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.060 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the most
emergent level of reality.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the latest
thing to emerge

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.795 align:middle line:84%
so that we can continue in
that imaginal realm for a bit.

00:35:09.795 --> 00:35:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I suspect
we have to re-engage

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:90%
with the biological realm.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what
I was just going to ask next,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.400 align:middle line:84%
because that's what everyone
listening to this right

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.858 align:middle line:84%
now at this point,
most people will

00:35:17.858 --> 00:35:20.043 align:middle line:84%
be asking that question
next is the re-engagement

00:35:20.043 --> 00:35:21.710 align:middle line:84%
or what is often
called "reincarnation."

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Reincarnation or the
transmigration of the soul--

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:25.035 align:middle line:90%
Exactly--

00:35:25.035 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: In the
Pythagoras transition--

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which just
makes logical sense.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yeah.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It may not be
answered to by science directly,

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:90%
although it should by now.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: I think the
problem for science

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:39.450 align:middle line:84%
is it can't engage at
the moment with this idea

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.212 align:middle line:84%
that soul is a level of
information in its own right.

00:35:42.212 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:90%
But once you get that--

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.180 align:middle line:90%
That is a big problem--

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Then you can see, OK.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So here's this information like
on the cloud, let's imagine.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Think of
the information

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.980 align:middle line:84%
being downloaded from the
cloud back onto a computer.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.270 align:middle line:84%
It's still on the
cloud, but it's

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.570 align:middle line:90%
re-engaged with a new computer.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.988 align:middle line:84%
So when you update
your computer,

00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:84%
you're like, oh,
that one's finished.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:35:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You still have
the old operating language.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: The stuff's there.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:00.895 align:middle line:90%
And then you--

00:36:00.895 --> 00:36:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
becomes your subconscious.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.715 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And then you can
operate on it physically,

00:36:04.715 --> 00:36:06.830 align:middle line:84%
just like I can operate
on it like this.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And the brain becomes much
more like an interface--

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Exactly--

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Between
these two levels.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.188 align:middle line:84%
And then essentially
what you are,

00:36:14.188 --> 00:36:16.230 align:middle line:84%
what's really happening--
oh, we're these bodies,

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.647 align:middle line:84%
and they're beautiful
and amazing.

00:36:17.647 --> 00:36:21.210 align:middle line:90%
And they do body stuff.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, what
you and I are are souls.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.900 align:middle line:84%
We're information on
this non-material level.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing here is
using the body to connect.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I have this
question here.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:10%
At what point do you think
it will become, quote,

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:10%
"scientifically validated," when
you have the bodies and bodies

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.600 align:middle line:10%
of work, such as that of
Ian Stevenson at University

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.080 align:middle line:10%
of Virginia and
some of his proteges

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.830 align:middle line:10%
and so forth that have
taken thousands of cases

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.320 align:middle line:10%
of little kids,
in particular, who

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:10%
have very clear
remembrance of past lives,

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.440 align:middle line:10%
right down to having the same
cigarette preferences at five

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.830 align:middle line:10%
years old that they
had sometime back

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:02.410 align:middle line:10%
or knowing all of the details
of these incredible stories?

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:90%
At what point--

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: When will that
be taken seriously?

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.023 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At what
point is there going

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:08.550 align:middle line:84%
to be enough mass for
science to actually recognize

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:90%
this is a scientific study?

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: My guess in all honesty
is that it will actually not

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:90%
be that way.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.120 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
will change is when

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:90%
there is a new philosophy--

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.480 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'm saying that
because I'm a philosopher.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But it feels like
once scientists

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.507 align:middle line:84%
can go, oh, that
could be true, then

00:37:30.507 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:84%
they'll look at the
information and go, wow.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.548 align:middle line:90%
There's loads of information.

00:37:33.548 --> 00:37:35.715 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, the problem
is, as I found recently--

00:37:35.715 --> 00:37:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's no interface--

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.527 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: With the
neuroscientists,

00:37:38.527 --> 00:37:39.520 align:middle line:90%
they're not listening.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't even look, because
it just can't be true for them,

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.660 align:middle line:90%
because reality goes to there.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And then once it goes to this
immaterial realm, which is

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.220 align:middle line:90%
actually where they function--

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.130 align:middle line:84%
they're brilliant in
that non-material realm

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:55.533 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
all thought is--

00:37:55.533 --> 00:37:56.700 align:middle line:90%
they don't see that as real.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.700 align:middle line:84%
They see that as some sort
of strange illusion, which

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.503 align:middle line:84%
is crazy, because it's the
most real thing we know.

00:38:02.503 --> 00:38:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
interesting about that,

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.545 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed,
because I know some

00:38:05.545 --> 00:38:07.920 align:middle line:84%
of these high-profile
physicists, for example,

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.760 align:middle line:84%
most of them are
deeply religious.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Yeah, that
can happen, too.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And you get this split
personality thing going.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
can't reconcile it

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:90%
in their own lives.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: No.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How can this
be reconciled at large,

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.098 align:middle line:84%
because I've always found
it the oddest phenomenon?

00:38:23.098 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: See, the
history of science,

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the reason it's
been so successful--

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.270 align:middle line:90%
and it was brilliant.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:84%
The amount of scientific
knowledge that's

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
been accumulated in the last 300
years or the last 50 or last 10

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.320 align:middle line:90%
is just so impressive.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's done that primarily
because it's done two things.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.637 align:middle line:84%
One, it's used a method which
goes, let's look at sensation.

00:38:44.637 --> 00:38:46.845 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's already limited
it, because our experience

00:38:46.845 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:84%
is of sensation but also
not, of imagination.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.350 align:middle line:90%
We've got two experiences.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's going, let's do
this in only the sensation,

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:90%
which it does.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And then let's study
things that can repeat,

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.340 align:middle line:90%
so we can check them.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, physics, the
least emergent form,

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.150 align:middle line:84%
the earliest form of existence,
it repeats really well.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.950 align:middle line:90%
If I pick up this--

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
do it, obviously.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But I pick it up and
drop it, it will fall.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:11.670 align:middle line:90%
If I do it, it'll fall again.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very repeatable.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You like
repeatable data.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Yeah, because
you can study that.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
But the more emergent levels
are more and more creative.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can just about
study in biology,

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:23.673 align:middle line:84%
but it's more
difficult. But trying

00:39:23.673 --> 00:39:25.590 align:middle line:84%
to predict what you're
going to say to me next

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:26.880 align:middle line:90%
is next to impossible.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, it is impossible.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So you're on such
a creative level

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.020 align:middle line:84%
now, the method which goes,
let's just repeat it and check

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.800 align:middle line:84%
it, it doesn't work, which is
why so much of the research

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:84%
is difficult to do because
the scientific method no

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:90%
longer works.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:43.900 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
this is unreal.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.390 align:middle line:84%
It just means it's on a more
emergent level of creativity.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is bringing to
mind, I did an interview

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.570 align:middle line:84%
for my own site recently
with a man named Paul Hynek.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a huge
show sweeping cable

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.400 align:middle line:84%
TV in America called
"Project Blue Book."

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.140 align:middle line:84%
"Project Blue Book"
has to do with

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.210 align:middle line:84%
military classified
documents regarding

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:02.970 align:middle line:84%
the government and
interfaces that

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.760 align:middle line:84%
were studied between UFOs
and extraterrestrials

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.600 align:middle line:90%
and human beings.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
big deal in its day.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So now History Channel has
made this into a series,

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:84%
basically starting the
process of declassification

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.320 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there have
been experiences.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.400 align:middle line:84%
We're just rolling
it out slowly.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.550 align:middle line:84%
But the central character is a
man named Dr. Allen Hynek, who

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:28.480 align:middle line:84%
was an astrophysicist and an
astronomer teaching at Ohio

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.150 align:middle line:90%
State University, I believe.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, when I
was interviewing his son,

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Paul Hynek, talking
about what this man was

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:84%
like, what their
lives were like,

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and so forth because he
was tasked with essentially

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.000 align:middle line:84%
disproving everything to
the public to make them

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.860 align:middle line:84%
doubt the experiences
they'd had--

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.630 align:middle line:84%
the government,
the military, was

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:50.650 align:middle line:84%
hiring him to explain away
everything people really

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.320 align:middle line:84%
seriously believed they were
interfacing with and in fact

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.503 align:middle line:84%
were, certainly some
of the time, anyway.

00:40:55.503 --> 00:40:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And so at the very
end of the interview,

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.878 align:middle line:84%
I was asking him
something about his dad.

00:40:58.878 --> 00:41:01.150 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of was random,
and then it made sense.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.280 align:middle line:84%
His dad was a scientist,
but he was open-minded.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.170 align:middle line:90%
He wanted the truth.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.950 align:middle line:90%
He wanted explanation.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he
was tasked with--

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:09.580 align:middle line:90%
very logical.

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But he was also a
Rosicrucian, who

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:17.870 align:middle line:84%
understands the vastness of
the cosmic interface of life.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, it was
a beautiful example

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.900 align:middle line:84%
of where in his own
being, he didn't fight

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.080 align:middle line:90%
those two parts of himself.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.590 align:middle line:84%
It actually brought
those two parts together

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
to be able to, I think,
create an inspirational story

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.563 align:middle line:84%
for humanity, that we can
embrace this new story.

00:41:34.563 --> 00:41:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: That's
definitely what we need.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And it is
emerging, like I said.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think it will be
huge when it arrives.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
there yet, but I

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.552 align:middle line:90%
think we've got a blueprint.

00:41:42.552 --> 00:41:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I obviously think this
evolutionary story

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.808 align:middle line:84%
I've been articulating
is a huge part of that.

00:41:47.808 --> 00:41:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
actually, what matters

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.220 align:middle line:90%
is the practical implications--

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:51.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The practical--

00:41:51.585 --> 00:41:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Which is how do we
then use that to wake up.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.128 align:middle line:84%
How can we experience this
oneness with the universe?

00:41:56.128 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:84%
How can we bring
loving attention

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:84%
to the problems we now face
individually, socially?

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.660 align:middle line:84%
How can we actually wake
up that we're alive,

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.792 align:middle line:84%
that this amazing thing
is happening to us?

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
at the same time,

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.208 align:middle line:84%
all these people on the
planet are experiencing

00:42:12.208 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:90%
incredible angst right now.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Sure.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of tension,
more polarization--

00:42:17.418 --> 00:42:18.460 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a stat down here.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.270 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:23.350 align:middle line:84%
In the past century, wars
have killed about 187 million

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:24.910 align:middle line:90%
human beings on this planet.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So we look at that
and think, jeez,

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:29.170 align:middle line:84%
that sounds like the Vedic
version of devolution,

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.420 align:middle line:84%
like a really
downward Yuga cycle.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, we're
all experiencing this thing

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.660 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about, too.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: We are.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.253 align:middle line:84%
We need to be careful
with these statistics,

00:42:39.253 --> 00:42:43.790 align:middle line:84%
because actually,
things have got--

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:46.440 align:middle line:84%
as a historian,
so many people die

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.830 align:middle line:90%
because there's so many of us.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: But statistically,
in terms of your likelihood

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.090 align:middle line:84%
to die, it's gone down
and down and down.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:57.460 align:middle line:84%
The changes I've seen
in my own lifetime,

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.510 align:middle line:84%
it's so much better,
where poverty is down.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Child mortality is done.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:03.860 align:middle line:84%
What we've done, we should
feel so proud of ourselves.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We should, except for
the fact we keep picking wars.

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We keep starting them
all over the planet.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Wars?

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wars.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: There's never
been so few wars.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These ridiculous
struggles with each other.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: What's happened,
I think, is actually,

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.347 align:middle line:84%
we've become sensitive
to how crazy wars are.

00:43:17.347 --> 00:43:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maybe that's it.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.347 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just that
we're noticing them more,

00:43:20.347 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:90%
you're saying?

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: I'm an Englishman.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:84%
My dad was in the
Second World War.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:27.100 align:middle line:90%
The whole planet went up.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.990 align:middle line:90%
I've never been in a war.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Probably, I'm the only
generation of Englishmen

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that that's been true for,
because the rest of history

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:35.320 align:middle line:90%
is just war, war, war.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.012 align:middle line:90%
Europe has had peace.

00:43:37.012 --> 00:43:38.220 align:middle line:90%
That's never happened before.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Huge changes-- we
are a man and a woman talking

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.280 align:middle line:90%
as equals.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Historically, that is--

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:45.210 align:middle line:90%
No, it's all true--

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.563 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Unbelievable.

00:43:46.563 --> 00:43:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're fed a
stream of that information

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.782 align:middle line:84%
all the time, of how
dangerous it is out there

00:43:51.782 --> 00:43:52.990 align:middle line:90%
and how there's always other.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be
prepared to fund something

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.172 align:middle line:90%
so we can fight other.

00:43:56.172 --> 00:43:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And some of
that's manipulation.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.447 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Some of
it's just we have

00:43:59.447 --> 00:44:01.580 align:middle line:84%
a natural biological
propensity, quite rightly,

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.170 align:middle line:90%
to look for the what's wrong.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Where is the danger?

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So part of the job,
I think, for people

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:08.930 align:middle line:84%
like ourselves is to go
out and go, you know what?

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.420 align:middle line:90%
We don't want any war.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And we want to get
rid of these things.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But within the context of
history, we're doing good.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good to say--

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.568 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: There are new problems
coming, which could be huge.

00:44:19.568 --> 00:44:20.860 align:middle line:90%
We need to pay those attention.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.720 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, let's
just go, well done.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you to our ancestors.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.180 align:middle line:90%
They got us here.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.795 align:middle line:84%
Now, how can we take it to
the next level of evolution?

00:44:27.795 --> 00:44:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
do you perceive

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:30.820 align:middle line:84%
as the threat on
the horizon that we

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.860 align:middle line:84%
need to start overcoming
through this evolution?

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Well, probably what's
going happen with the climate

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.210 align:middle line:90%
is the most likely thing.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it's still
up in the air.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But the people in the know
seem pretty concerned,

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and we should take that
seriously, I think,

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and listen to what
they have to say.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:48.430 align:middle line:90%
And the scale of the problem--

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware that we can,
again, exaggerate.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.320 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, I
thought the whole world

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.160 align:middle line:84%
was going to be destroyed
by nuclear weapons.

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: But we've got through,
but it looked like that.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And we were all very
worried and still should be.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:90%
But we've held it together.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And my hope is that we
can pay loving attention

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.230 align:middle line:90%
to these problems.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:06.797 align:middle line:84%
And the key, it
feels like, look,

00:45:06.797 --> 00:45:08.005 align:middle line:90%
let's wake up to what we are.

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.480 align:middle line:90%
We are the universe.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.470 align:middle line:84%
We are immortal souls on this
deeply meaningful journey,

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:18.390 align:middle line:84%
in which we are part
of the whole thing.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we can really
own what existence is,

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.080 align:middle line:84%
see it for what it is, and work
together, we're so creative.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are indeed.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:28.960 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at this--

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And we've
got God on our side.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.187 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There we go.

00:45:31.187 --> 00:45:33.470 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to
your definition of "God."

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: And it's helping us.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.895 align:middle line:84%
We'll get around to that
toward the very end here.

00:45:36.895 --> 00:45:38.403 align:middle line:90%
But meanwhile, we look around.

00:45:38.403 --> 00:45:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about this
in a lot of shows,

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.080 align:middle line:84%
because it's where people
are experiencing life,

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:42.900 align:middle line:90%
on the ground, right?

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yeah.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.697 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on
the ground, there

00:45:44.697 --> 00:45:47.540 align:middle line:84%
are these increased tensions and
anxieties right now globally.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.400 align:middle line:90%
It's happening globally.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:54.530 align:middle line:84%
How do you perceive this window
we're in and its function?

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a different
point of view on it.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I happen to think it's a
good thing, because it's

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:02.810 align:middle line:84%
going to crack open a
part of ourselves that

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.700 align:middle line:90%
can become more emergent.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But everyone has
a point of view.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.030 align:middle line:90%
So what is yours?

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Well, maybe like
you, I'm inherently optimistic

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.730 align:middle line:90%
and I hope not without reason.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's my
nature, but there's

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.920 align:middle line:84%
something about the deep
awake state and that love

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.920 align:middle line:90%
that just gives me hope.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.003 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't mean that
bad things can't happen.

00:46:22.003 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:90%
They do, all the time.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean we couldn't
go through a really difficult

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:25.450 align:middle line:90%
patch.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:26.600 align:middle line:90%
We really could.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.760 align:middle line:84%
But my feeling is that
alongside it, like you said,

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.860 align:middle line:84%
there's this undercurrent
of awakening.

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Here are obvious things.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I love the obvious, and
we miss them sometimes.

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:41.300 align:middle line:84%
There has never been a time
in the whole of history

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.170 align:middle line:84%
where so many people have
cared about other human beings

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:47.720 align:middle line:84%
in other places in the world
they'll never ever meet.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, true.

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:49.730 align:middle line:90%
They had no means of connection.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: They had no means.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.600 align:middle line:84%
But even if they
could have done,

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.600 align:middle line:90%
they hated their neighbors.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.510 align:middle line:90%
They had a connection with them.

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Travel wars.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.893 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: They hated them,
and they stole from them

00:46:55.893 --> 00:46:58.345 align:middle line:84%
and pirated them and
warred with them forever.

00:46:58.345 --> 00:46:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:00.553 align:middle line:90%
When I look at that, yeah.

00:47:00.553 --> 00:47:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: That's a huge
shift in compassion.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.940 align:middle line:90%
People genuinely care about--

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.070 align:middle line:84%
when the Iraq War
happened, people

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:10.520 align:middle line:84%
came out to say no to this
war across the whole planet.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.740 align:middle line:84%
They didn't stop it, but when
has that ever, ever happened?

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.540 align:middle line:90%
These are huge.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
I agree with you.

00:47:15.915 --> 00:47:18.510 align:middle line:84%
When you think that only
100, 200 years ago--

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.880 align:middle line:90%
less than that in America.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.590 align:middle line:84%
You could go back
even 50 years--

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:25.010 align:middle line:84%
people would show up for public
hangings as entertainment,

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:27.080 align:middle line:90%
with dull eyes.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.230 align:middle line:90%
We are moving beyond that.

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:29.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's what gives me hope.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: So we've done
that with human beings.

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:34.698 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: So we've got a sense of
oneness emerging with humanity.

00:47:34.698 --> 00:47:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And also behind that, there's
a sense of oneness with nature.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole issue
about how we treat nature,

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.520 align:middle line:84%
but huge numbers
of people care now.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And they care about
the polar bear.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Why?

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.947 align:middle line:84%
Why would a human being
care about a bear that

00:47:48.947 --> 00:47:50.720 align:middle line:90%
would like to rip it to shreds?

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But we do, because we
identify with something

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:55.490 align:middle line:90%
bigger than ourselves.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And the younger generation
hugely concerned

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.940 align:middle line:84%
about not only environmental
factors of the consumption

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:04.550 align:middle line:84%
of animals, for example--
and I'm not getting on

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.830 align:middle line:90%
any soapbox any which way.

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:08.668 align:middle line:90%
It's veganism now--

00:48:08.668 --> 00:48:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Veganism, huge--

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is really massive.

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.700 align:middle line:84%
We're noticing this all over
the world, when I travel,

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that menus all
over the world now

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.640 align:middle line:90%
have vegan cuisine offerings.

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.960 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't there even
two or three years ago.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it's being driven
by the younger generation.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.650 align:middle line:84%
One of my past lives here was
I had a cooking show on PBS,

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.660 align:middle line:84%
a vegetarian cooking
show, for quite a while

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and was vegetarian for 20 years.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, the
kids were driving it.

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And the parents would write
in and ask what to do,

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:41.940 align:middle line:84%
because their kids had refused
to eat animals any longer.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the kids are saying, I'm
not having any butter or eggs.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm out.

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just refining
and refining itself.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And there is a quality
to that that you

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:55.430 align:middle line:84%
see this communality
rising, this

00:48:55.430 --> 00:49:00.260 align:middle line:84%
want for really healthy sources
of their vegetables and foods

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.450 align:middle line:84%
that have been untampered
with by chemicals.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:03.890 align:middle line:90%
It's really quite beautiful.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's becoming
not ubiquitous yet,

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.608 align:middle line:84%
but it's strengthening
in numbers rapidly.

00:49:10.608 --> 00:49:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: That's what I
mean by the transformation

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:14.710 align:middle line:84%
of an individual
into a "unividual."

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.257 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And the deeper
sense-- nowhere near as big,

00:49:18.257 --> 00:49:19.340 align:middle line:90%
but it's definitely there.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I get to see it when
I travel, for sure--

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.110 align:middle line:84%
is that underneath it, there
are more and more people

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that when I go out now and
I go, on the deepest level,

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.290 align:middle line:84%
we're one with the
universe, most people nod.

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: 20 years ago,
people looked puzzled.

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.270 align:middle line:90%
This shift is happening.

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And our job is to make
the shift ourselves,

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:43.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's together, and
to support each other both

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.450 align:middle line:84%
becoming more individual--
not less, more individual--

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.210 align:middle line:84%
because the more
individual we become,

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:51.260 align:middle line:84%
the more we think for ourselves,
the more we are ourselves,

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.500 align:middle line:90%
the more conscious we are.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.217 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:49:54.217 --> 00:49:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: We have
to use doubt, which

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:59.570 align:middle line:84%
is what makes us
conscious, because we all

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:02.250 align:middle line:90%
grow up through a culture.

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to wake up from
that culture by doubting it.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.205 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean we dismiss it.

00:50:06.205 --> 00:50:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It just means we
step out from it

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.038 align:middle line:84%
and go, oh, what
do I make of that?

00:50:09.038 --> 00:50:09.980 align:middle line:90%
I grew up a Catholic.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:10.610 align:middle line:90%
What do I make of that?

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I grew up a Muslim.

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:11.990 align:middle line:90%
What do I make of that?

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:13.340 align:middle line:90%
I grew up a secular atheist.

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:14.480 align:middle line:90%
What do I make of that?

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you can make it
your own, if it feels right.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Or you move on.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But either way,
you've individuated.

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.970 align:middle line:90%
You're an individual.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:25.580 align:middle line:90%
You've become a free soul.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.850 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer just enmeshed
in this unconscious collective.

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.550 align:middle line:84%
If you can do that
enough, then you

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.060 align:middle line:84%
can become conscious
of the oneness.

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And then
you "unividuate"

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:37.070 align:middle line:90%
from individuating.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened
to us collectively

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.640 align:middle line:84%
in our culture in
the West is we've

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.182 align:middle line:84%
been through an age
of individualism.

00:50:42.182 --> 00:50:42.982 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:42.982 --> 00:50:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: And it's been great.

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't wear the
same clothes anymore.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.140 align:middle line:90%
We do our own thing.

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.760 align:middle line:90%
It's OK we're different.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Sexuality can be whatever
you want it to be.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It's been a beautiful thing,
but it's come with problems.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And we've become lonely.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.730 align:middle line:90%
We're cut off from each other.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Community, which
was unconscious,

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.270 align:middle line:90%
is just kind of disappearing.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:05.240 align:middle line:84%
We now need to consciously
bring that back.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's no longer
unconscious community.

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:09.250 align:middle line:90%
It's conscious community.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:11.100 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer
unconscious oneness.

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.330 align:middle line:90%
It's conscious oneness.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And we do that by going
deeper into our individuality,

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.170 align:middle line:84%
because that's
beautiful, but then going

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.320 align:middle line:84%
beyond it to something
bigger than ourselves.

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what my
husband writes about and speaks

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.320 align:middle line:84%
about and is his
passion in life is

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.110 align:middle line:84%
this development of our
unique divine genius

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.610 align:middle line:84%
in every human being,
which moves beyond gender.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:30.810 align:middle line:90%
It moves beyond everything.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:34.100 align:middle line:84%
It's, what is that thing that
you've come to express in life?

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And how do you join
hands together then

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and express your
genius with each other

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to create complex, diverse,
emergent communities,

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.250 align:middle line:84%
spiritually emergent
communities?

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's very
similar to the vision you have.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: It really is.

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I can offer
hopefully with the philosophy,

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:84%
this evolutionary philosophy,
is go, you know that thing which

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:59.090 align:middle line:84%
absolutely you intuitively
know that to be true, I think,

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:01.460 align:middle line:84%
that's inherent to the
nature of the universe,

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.260 align:middle line:84%
because the whole universe,
it doesn't have a purpose.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.520 align:middle line:84%
It is a purpose,
because what it is

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:84%
is the realization
of potentiality

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.090 align:middle line:90%
in ever more emergent ways.

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:12.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:12.920 align:middle line:90%
So what are you?

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're that.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:14.750 align:middle line:90%
So what's your purpose?

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, to realize your
deepest potentialities

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:19.550 align:middle line:84%
in more and more
emergent ways and keep

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.080 align:middle line:90%
growing into something more.

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same insight that
I think you're talking about.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:23.910 align:middle line:90%
There's the genius.

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:25.030 align:middle line:90%
There's what you've come.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:26.072 align:middle line:90%
There's the opportunity--

00:52:26.072 --> 00:52:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Uniquely equipped
with desire to offer.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And you know
that's your purpose.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And it will have
resonances with others.

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:middle line:84%
We all need to wake
up to our oneness.

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.810 align:middle line:84%
We all need to
express that love.

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But you're doing it in this
way, I'm doing it in that way,

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and that's governed by our past.

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Our character, the
character of our soul,

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.010 align:middle line:84%
is made of everything
that we've experienced.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And that enables me to do
things that others can't do,

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.640 align:middle line:84%
enables you to do
things that I can't do,

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.380 align:middle line:90%
and that's true for all of us.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's what makes

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.690 align:middle line:90%
a rich and complex society.

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's been
kind of stripped out

00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:59.420 align:middle line:90%
of us in the industrial age.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.980 align:middle line:90%
It kind of killed that spirit.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But now, we're
emerging from that age.

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And like you say and
many people said,

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:06.770 align:middle line:84%
we went from that to
the information age.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're moving
even beyond that,

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:13.230 align:middle line:84%
into this age of a much more
fine spiritual development.

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
read this from you.

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:15.935 align:middle line:90%
This is one of your quotes.

00:53:15.935 --> 00:53:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we get into the nature
of God in our last few minutes

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:19.340 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:22.532 align:middle line:84%
And then I have one final
question that still stumps me.

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:23.990 align:middle line:84%
It says, "In the
after-death state,

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:26.780 align:middle line:84%
we come together in
the communion of souls

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.880 align:middle line:90%
to create God."

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying,
essentially, we come together.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And the communion of
these souls is God.

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yes.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
that, implications of that.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.722 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: So we
mentioned earlier that

00:53:37.722 --> 00:53:39.620 align:middle line:84%
like the community of
cells forms the body,

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.985 align:middle line:90%
that souls come together.

00:53:40.985 --> 00:53:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
happening now.

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.528 align:middle line:84%
I think as we sit here
resonating, it's happening.

00:53:44.528 --> 00:53:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But in a very deep way, I
think it happens after death.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.590 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things which people

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:50.240 align:middle line:84%
report of the
near-death experience

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.460 align:middle line:90%
is this light, a love light.

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.962 align:middle line:10%
And you can go right back to
the "Tibetan Book of the Dead,"

00:53:54.962 --> 00:53:56.420 align:middle line:10%
and they're talking
about it there.

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.340 align:middle line:10%
And one of the translations
of the name for it

00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:59.140 align:middle line:10%
there is beautiful.

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:03.590 align:middle line:10%
They call it the "luminosity
of potentiality."

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's the formless
potential, and there it is.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the old idea that I
think you mentioned earlier

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:12.290 align:middle line:84%
in a different context is,
oh, this is all a mistake.

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:15.933 align:middle line:84%
So dissolve back into it,
like a drop into the ocean.

00:54:15.933 --> 00:54:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't think about
it too much, it's quite nice.

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:19.820 align:middle line:84%
You're like, oh, yeah,
I'll dissolve into it.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.260 align:middle line:84%
That sounds nice,
until you think, oh,

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.250 align:middle line:84%
that means everything I've
ever been is a waste of time.

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not rational.

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: It doesn't
mean anything,

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.350 align:middle line:90%
that life is pointless.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Better if
it never happened.

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: So my take on it
is is that the insight just

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.330 align:middle line:84%
needs flipping and that
actually, what's happening

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:39.202 align:middle line:84%
is that we are
filaments in that light.

00:54:39.202 --> 00:54:40.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
near-death experience

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:43.040 align:middle line:84%
which a lady shared for
me when I talked once.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And she said, what I saw in
my near-death experience was

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:50.200 align:middle line:84%
the light and then souls,
which the image was

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.690 align:middle line:84%
of little sparks going up to
the light and falling away.

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm suggesting is the
light is all those sparks.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.670 align:middle line:84%
As we wake up-- so at death,
we can go into that conscious

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:04.700 align:middle line:84%
oneness, that enormous
love, that bliss,

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and be there for a bit, but
not by dissolving into it,

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.490 align:middle line:84%
but by staying
individual within it--

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you on that--

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And therefore
being conscious within it.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Otherwise,
you would not

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.220 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to even
come back into this continuum

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.170 align:middle line:90%
and do it again.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us what
you believe this part

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:23.720 align:middle line:84%
of the game of our
evolutionary path

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.350 align:middle line:84%
is all about, when we're looking
at coming back into a body,

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.810 align:middle line:84%
back where time,
for most people,

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.850 align:middle line:84%
comes up as their
greatest enemy,

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:33.240 align:middle line:90%
because nothing's happening.

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.040 align:middle line:90%
We think it.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.450 align:middle line:90%
We desire it.

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:37.105 align:middle line:90%
We can create it and believe it.

00:55:37.105 --> 00:55:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we sit
and wait and wait

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and wait for it to manifest
into the physical reality.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And many people never
have that satisfaction.

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Some people can do it like that.

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So as a species, I think people
tend to view time as an enemy,

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:49.890 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the resistance
of difference in life,

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.600 align:middle line:90%
the differences on the planet--

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.990 align:middle line:84%
so how does that play
out in your mind?

00:55:56.990 --> 00:56:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And at what point do we stop
playing that part of it out?

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: For me,
time is what life is.

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.110 align:middle line:90%
It's what existence is.

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:06.380 align:middle line:90%
It's the unfolding of time.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.090 align:middle line:90%
That's all we ever experience.

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And because of the presence of
the past that's accumulating,

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:13.440 align:middle line:84%
there's this what
I call "pastivity,"

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.460 align:middle line:90%
which is like gravity.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.617 align:middle line:84%
So the past keeps
everything the same.

00:56:16.617 --> 00:56:17.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a jolly good thing.

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.400 align:middle line:90%
It means my cup is still here.

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.580 align:middle line:90%
The desk is still here.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.380 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:22.820 align:middle line:90%
But it's also a negative part.

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.348 align:middle line:90%
It's the habits of the universe.

00:56:24.348 --> 00:56:25.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's also the habits of Tim.

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Some of those are
good habits, some not.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.637 align:middle line:90%
Some hold me back.

00:56:28.637 --> 00:56:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Some are things which
happened to me earlier

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:33.060 align:middle line:84%
that stopped me
being all I could.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So this desk is going
to stay the desk,

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:38.180 align:middle line:90%
but I can change my soul.

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm working with is
the character of my soul.

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And the great transformative
work is to find the wounds

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:46.940 align:middle line:90%
and turn them into wisdom.

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:51.040 align:middle line:84%
It's to take the stuff which
is lead and holding us back

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and, like the
alchemists, turn it

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:54.680 align:middle line:90%
into gold, as a gift to life.

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
here is because we

00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:02.510 align:middle line:84%
are made of the past, we're in
a process of soul formation.

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:04.070 align:middle line:90%
We are forming ourselves.

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:05.990 align:middle line:84%
In every moment,
we form ourselves.

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:08.850 align:middle line:84%
This conversation is
now part of who we are.

00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So we have the choice
how do we form ourselves.

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And if we can form ourselves
in the most emergent way,

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:15.890 align:middle line:90%
it's better for us.

00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:16.900 align:middle line:90%
We become more conscious.

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.700 align:middle line:90%
There's more joy.

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.240 align:middle line:90%
There's more creativity.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's better
for everyone else,

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:23.840 align:middle line:84%
because we can
give to existence.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And also, I think
when we die, we're

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.770 align:middle line:84%
able to enter into--
well, now, before we die,

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:31.880 align:middle line:84%
we're able to enter into
that oneness of love

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.683 align:middle line:90%
much more deeply.

00:57:32.683 --> 00:57:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And I would probably
add one thing to it,

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
notion of patience.

00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:42.710 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the
virtue that's most needed,

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:43.970 align:middle line:90%
beyond every other one.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I put kindness as the
number one virtue.

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But patience I would
say is incredible,

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:52.070 align:middle line:84%
because then if you can be
patient with how time flows

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:55.940 align:middle line:84%
through and how these habits
dissolve or resist, persist,

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, then we start
learning to have I always

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:01.820 align:middle line:84%
call it "faith in
Life" with the big L,

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:05.000 align:middle line:84%
what our soul is really
propelling us toward.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.260 align:middle line:90%
But it takes patience.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And we lose so
much faith in life

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.810 align:middle line:84%
because we lose patience that
it's not happening the way we'd

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:13.670 align:middle line:90%
like to see it roll out.

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yeah.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.410 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:18.095 align:middle line:84%
I'm not very good at
patience, but you're right.

00:58:18.095 --> 00:58:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean patience--

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm horrible in traffic.

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm not patient.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:22.812 align:middle line:84%
But in the big
picture, I'm patient.

00:58:22.812 --> 00:58:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: I'm OK with traffic.

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the big picture
that I can't.

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Here's the way it looks to me.

00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:31.520 align:middle line:84%
When I was 12 and I
woke up to the big love,

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.190 align:middle line:84%
it's exactly the same as
when I experience it now.

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:35.943 align:middle line:90%
It's just this love.

00:58:35.943 --> 00:58:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I say "love," I don't
mean just pink fluffy love.

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean big, strong, robust love.

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:46.340 align:middle line:84%
What changes is wisdom,
and that's the patience.

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And patience is wisdom.

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the knowledge that
everything takes time.

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.430 align:middle line:90%
That's what it takes.

00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So to get from here to a more
emergent state, it takes time.

00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And it takes wisdom,
and it takes effort.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So I hope in these decades
since I've been 12,

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:03.900 align:middle line:84%
even though the love
has stayed the same,

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I hope I've become a little
bit wiser in how to love,

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.040 align:middle line:84%
because the dilemma
we all face is we

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.960 align:middle line:84%
don't just live in the
most emergent place.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.070 align:middle line:90%
We live with all of it.

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:14.720 align:middle line:90%
So we live with matter.

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.010 align:middle line:90%
We live with biology.

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:18.553 align:middle line:84%
We live with all those less
emergent levels of humanity.

00:59:18.553 --> 00:59:19.970 align:middle line:84%
We live with people
who are living

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:21.350 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle Ages,
who want to blow you up

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:22.820 align:middle line:90%
because you're not a Muslim.

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And we live with
fundamentalists.

00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:25.360 align:middle line:90%
We live with all of it.

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And somehow,
we need to love that.

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And that takes wisdom.

00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does take wisdom.

00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And that
takes time to acquire.

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:33.067 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It takes patience.

00:59:33.067 --> 00:59:34.035 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Yeah.

00:59:34.035 --> 00:59:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So my final
question is this,

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:37.035 align:middle line:84%
because this is
the one part when

00:59:37.035 --> 00:59:40.190 align:middle line:84%
I think about what comes
first, always what comes first,

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:41.375 align:middle line:90%
if you can even do that.

00:59:41.375 --> 00:59:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying it's
all emergent together.

00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And we can witness
the world around us.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:49.055 align:middle line:84%
This is what's emerged
from the human experience

00:59:49.055 --> 00:59:50.180 align:middle line:90%
and level of consciousness.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And I say, so where
did a rose come from?

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Where did
a rose come from?

00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
amount of perfection.

00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: I think to
me, what we have--

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:05.305 align:middle line:90%
the--

01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know it's
a tough question.

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:08.555 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: No, it's a
beautiful question.

01:00:08.555 --> 01:00:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I love the question,
because actually,

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
other way around.

01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I think what's happened is the
ability to appreciate beauty--

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is huge--

01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Is what has emerged.

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And then we look
back at what was there,

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:24.943 align:middle line:84%
which was functional, and we
go, oh, but it's beautiful.

01:00:24.943 --> 01:00:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience
the other day.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I was walking out
in the countryside,

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.760 align:middle line:90%
and it was evening.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.910 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And I looked out, and
there right on the horizon

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
was the sun going
down, gorgeous.

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around, and behind
me was the moon, just as big.

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:38.720 align:middle line:90%
It was exquisite.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked at
the cows, and they just

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.363 align:middle line:90%
weren't interested.

01:00:42.363 --> 01:00:43.280 align:middle line:90%
They were just eating.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
They weren't looking around
at each other going, hey,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.730 align:middle line:84%
have you noticed
that sun and moon?

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:47.840 align:middle line:90%
They weren't doing that.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They were just eating, because
they hadn't got to that place

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.170 align:middle line:84%
yet where they
were going, can you

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:56.968 align:middle line:84%
see that that thing that
gives us light is beautiful?

01:00:56.968 --> 01:00:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I agree with you.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: And so
what I would suggest

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
is that the really interesting
thing-- or the arising

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.500 align:middle line:90%
of the rose is amazing.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's the arising in
the soul of the ability

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.840 align:middle line:90%
to see the beauty in creation.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.923 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to appreciate
it, because it doesn't

01:01:10.923 --> 01:01:12.560 align:middle line:90%
have any real functional use.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not functional.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It is a thing of
beauty in and of itself

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:18.360 align:middle line:90%
that sprang from something.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.300 align:middle line:90%
And I think that it's beautiful.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Contemplating the
nature of a rose to me

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:24.890 align:middle line:90%
is a very complex thing.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And we could probably go on and
ask questions back and forth

01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:28.580 align:middle line:90%
on many dimensions.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: That's the key.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
point is what you just

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.490 align:middle line:90%
said is very, very true.

01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of how a
rose was ever fashioned,

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
the point is we have the
ability to appreciate its beauty

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:41.342 align:middle line:84%
for beauty's sake, symmetry
for symmetry's sake,

01:01:41.342 --> 01:01:42.300 align:middle line:90%
scent for scent's sake.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.310 align:middle line:10%
>>FREKE: It's so
wonderful that maybe not

01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:45.110 align:middle line:10%
with a rose, because the
rose has been fashioned

01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:46.610 align:middle line:10%
so much by human
beings-- but if you

01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:50.250 align:middle line:10%
take a beautiful natural flower
before there were human beings,

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:51.500 align:middle line:10%
it's interesting to think, OK.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.447 align:middle line:84%
So that beauty was
there way before there

01:01:53.447 --> 01:01:55.280 align:middle line:84%
was a consciousness
going, wow look at that.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:01.053 align:middle line:84%
And so beauty is another
one of the noble truths

01:02:01.053 --> 01:02:01.970 align:middle line:90%
that I hold very high.

01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: It's a great
emerging quality.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.622 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kindness,
patience, beauty,

01:02:04.622 --> 01:02:05.955 align:middle line:90%
those are very high on my list.

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FREKE: Me, too.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
they are yours, as well.

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: The greatest
things come last.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:10.270 align:middle line:90%
So--

01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:12.073 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Justice and
empathy, all of them.

01:02:12.073 --> 01:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
on that note, it's

01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
been a really
wonderful conversation.

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
It's good to see you
in the flesh again.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.280 align:middle line:90%
We were trying to figure out.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.550 align:middle line:84%
It was a long time ago at-- what
was the name of the conference?

01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FREKE: Science
and Non-Duality.

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Science and
Non-Duality Conference

01:02:24.413 --> 01:02:26.158 align:middle line:84%
in Marin County,
Mauricio's conference.

01:02:26.158 --> 01:02:27.200 align:middle line:90%
So it's been a long time.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:27.780 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.150 align:middle line:84%
You haven't changed
a bit, and it's

01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:30.775 align:middle line:84%
nice to meet your
beautiful wife, who's

01:02:30.775 --> 01:02:33.060 align:middle line:84%
with you behind the
scenes here today.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.280 align:middle line:90%
So thanks again, Tim.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.342 align:middle line:84%
Lovely, and I hope your
book does really well,

01:02:36.342 --> 01:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
because you are part of
stitching those stories

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.180 align:middle line:90%
together for people.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's a hopeful one.

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:43.790 align:middle line:10%
Again, Tim's book is
titled "Soul Story--

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:46.160 align:middle line:10%
Evolution and the Purpose
of Life," which you
