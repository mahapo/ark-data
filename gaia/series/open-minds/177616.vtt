00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We often
hear the word alchemy bandied

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.650 align:middle line:10%
about, but with little
substance as to its definition.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:10%
Today, we'll be speaking
with Dr. Theresa Bullard,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:10%
an interdisciplinary
scientist who

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:10%
is steeped in the wisdom
of the Universal Kabbalah.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:84%
She will break down the
process of human evolution

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
for us using the
metaphor of alchemy,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
which I find to be
personally very useful.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Finally, somebody is actually
using the word alchemy.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:84%
First of all, OK,
your background

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:84%
is in the hard
sciences, in physics,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
in neutrino physics and all
the way into nanotechnology.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.909 align:middle line:84%
So give us an idea of who
you are so everybody knows

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:90%
what they're getting into here.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.827 align:middle line:10%
>>THERESA BULLARD: Sure,
so I have, as you say,

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:10%
I have a background in physics.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:10%
And I was very
focused for a while.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And just career and physics,
and following that mainstream

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:90%
track.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And then as I got into
my graduate studies,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.032 align:middle line:84%
I just realized
that it wasn't all

00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:90%
that it was cracked up to be.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't at all what I
was hoping it would be.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were
you hoping to get out

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:90%
of it that wasn't there?

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
listening to this, or even

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:84%
there are kids in college
that are struggling with this.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:90%
You, what's your part of that?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, so
when I went in to--

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:10%
now I always had sort
of a spiritual side,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:10%
and I was always much
more well-rounded

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:10%
in terms of my interests.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I got into
physics in graduate school,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping that we'd be
able to get into like some

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
of the philosophy, or what
does this quantum physics

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:90%
stuff mean?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And you know like
really talk about

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:84%
how it really applies
to us and what

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:90%
the bigger implications are.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.142 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't want to
talk about that at all.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:90%
They'd really discouraged it.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was like pass your
test, do your research,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
do your homework, and
don't ask questions.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And so after about
a year of this,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I was in 80 hours of left
brain physics per week.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And whereas prior, I
had just diversity.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And so after about a year,
I found myself really

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:90%
out of balance and not happy.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just decided
like, OK, I'm not

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.746 align:middle line:84%
sure this is even what I
thought it was going to be,

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:84%
or what I was hoping it would
be, why I'm even doing it.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I knew I wanted to get my
PhD, but I didn't really

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
know yet what I was going to
do specifically with that,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
because I knew I didn't really
want to go into academia.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I just thought is
this worth the sacrificing

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:90%
my well-being and my happiness?

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was starting to get
depressed and so forth.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And I just decided I need
to find what's ever going

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:90%
to bring that balance back.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I started searching.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.541 align:middle line:84%
And I brought all these
different aspects of life

00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:42.956 align:middle line:84%
back in that normal
society says this

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:45.080 align:middle line:84%
is what you need to do to
live a well-rounded life.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Like social time, and creative
hobbies, and athletics,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And it all helped, but
about a year later I

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.106 align:middle line:84%
was still feeling like
there's still something

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.620 align:middle line:90%
really important missing.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.985 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was at the gym,
and I just thinking about,

00:02:57.985 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:90%
well, what's still missing?

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.744 align:middle line:84%
And this light bulb, this
little voice came in and just

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
said, well, one thing you
still haven't brought back

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:90%
in from what you had before.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:90%
And it was spirituality.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And so at that
point, I just like

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of surprised, because
I was very well indoctrinated

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
into the scientific way
of thinking at that point.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was never
that important to me.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:90%
It was just sort of there.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I was exposed, but it was just
my own personal background

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.670 align:middle line:90%
philosophy.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And yet here it was the one
thing I hadn't brought back in.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, OK, I'm
going to pursue it.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And then as I got
into, you know,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.135 align:middle line:84%
anything that was going
to work for me spiritually

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
had to agree with what
I knew scientifically.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't just be in direct
opposition to each other.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I started studying all
this science and spirituality,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
science and consciousness,
and it woke me up.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And I got really excited.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you were also
steeped in it as a child.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I was I was exposed
to it from a very early age.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So my parents were both into
the Edgar Cayce studies.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
My dad knew hypnotherapy,
my mom was also

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
on the board of directors
for the Monroe Institute

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Professional Division.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'd been exposed
to it, but as a child,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.392 align:middle line:84%
I was a little bit
like this, right?

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I guess because
your parents were doing it.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: [LAUGHS]
They were my parents.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your parents
are always suspect.

00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.696 align:middle line:84%
I was growing up
in Orange County,

00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:84%
California, which is like fairly
conservative and standard,

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to fit in.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the kind of
being really different

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:90%
was not really my cup of tea.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.944 align:middle line:84%
So I just was exposed, but
my parents fortunately,

00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:84%
they never really
pushed anything on us.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:84%
They let us really just
make up our own mind.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So I explored, but I never
really decided what I believe.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I kind of like, well,
I don't know the truth.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to claim this
or that because I don't know.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't until I
got into college, actually,

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
that I started to
finally be exposed

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.037 align:middle line:84%
to some things that really spoke
to me, that spoke to my soul.

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
that really turned me on

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.090 align:middle line:84%
was the transcendental poets
like Wordsworth, and Thoreau,

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:90%
and Emerson.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I got
into some of the Zen Buddhism.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit of Native
American shamanism, and just

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:90%
started to explore.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And take little
pieces here and there

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and formulate my own
personal philosophy.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
was that I'd grow

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:84%
for a certain amount of
time, and I'd find answers

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.482 align:middle line:84%
that I liked, but then I'd hit a
point with each of those things

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that I was trying, I'd hit
a point where I was like--

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.095 align:middle line:90%
it just felt like I hit a wall.

00:05:19.095 --> 00:05:19.895 align:middle line:90%
I hit that plateau.

00:05:19.895 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The limitation of it.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I'd go on
to the next thing.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I go to the next
thing and then, you know, grow

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:90%
and then hit that wall.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I just sort of
formulated my own philosophy.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I,
after graduate school,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
or during graduate
school, that I just

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:84%
decided I need to put my
spirituality in front,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
because this is one of the
keys to my happiness and sense

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:90%
of meaning and purpose.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And why am I even doing
the physics, right?

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting,
because what you brought up

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
a few minutes ago, about
having your scientific training

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:84%
in direct opposition to your
spiritual understanding.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.522 align:middle line:84%
What I have found so ironic
through the years, because I've

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.730 align:middle line:84%
interviewed a lot of
scientists, a lot of physicists,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And normally, if I'm
interviewing them,

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
they have a very strong, very
proactive spiritual side,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:84%
yet, a lot of the
spiritual practices

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:84%
are still diametrically
opposed to some

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.950 align:middle line:84%
of their understandings in
the world of kind of material

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:90%
science and even physics.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And I always
wondered how can you

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
bridge that and live
with essentially

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
the cognitive dissonance
of believing something here

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:84%
that's totally belief based,
and then having such a staunchly

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:90%
held viewpoint in the sciences?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists themselves
seem to live that conundrum.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: [LAUGHS]
Some of them do.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some of them, yeah.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ones I would
be interviewing, yeah.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.556 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, so I knew like
just blind faith

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going to work for
me because I had already

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:84%
hit that wall as a
child, growing up

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:90%
with exposure to Christianity.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would ask
simple questions like,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:90%
where do the dinosaurs fit in?

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'd hit this wall where
they just couldn't go there.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, if you can't

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:84%
answer these simple questions
that science already knows,

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet I knew, in
my heart of hearts,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there was a
spiritual side to life.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:90%
And I had experienced it.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:90%
And I had felt it.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But I just was really hands-off
with religion I think.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:10%
But then as I got
into graduate school,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:10%
as I got into studying
some of the math

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:10%
and some of the quantum physics,
and the more I actually really

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:10%
explored into it, the more
to me it actually said,

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:10%
well, you know this
universe is so perfect.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Like there's such fine
tuning in the universe.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's these
mathematical connections that

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:90%
were just fascinating to me.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I thought, how
could it be otherwise?

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be some
intelligence behind this.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I always believed that
there's a spiritual side.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the science
actually verified

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:90%
it more and more and more.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But that we needed to
be more in the quantum

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:84%
mindset, the quantum
way of thinking,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:84%
rather than the old
Newtonian way of thinking

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that was so materialistic and
kind of clockwork universe.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But there have been times
on my spiritual path

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
where I really had to walk
away from some of the linear,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
logical, you got to prove
it to me in tangible terms

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.600 align:middle line:84%
or I won't believe
it, thinking that we

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:90%
get trained as as scientists.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And had to just start
to open up my perception

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and my open-mindedness of
there's possibilities here.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
allow myself to believe.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to learn
to discern by the fruits,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
yes or no to anything

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
until it proves itself to me.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But how does it
prove itself to me?

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:84%
By my own changes
in my own life.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And so there was several
things that I experienced

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.710 align:middle line:84%
along the way that I didn't
know if I could explain it,

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
how it worked,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:90%
but I knew it was working.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And so as a scientist,
it's like, well,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:90%
there's my evidence.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Now my job is to figure
out how does that work?

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, science should
be more based in that anyway,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to protect
tenure grants and so forth.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
unfortunate thing.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be an area
of extreme exploration.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And instead, it seems to
more narrow down than open

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.276 align:middle line:90%
up a lot of times, which is sad.

00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It is sad.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of what
turned me off, actually,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
to the science
track, ultimately.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:84%
It was like in the early days
of quantum physics revolution,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:84%
when we were shifting from
that Newtonian-- everything is

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Newtonian, we're just coming
down to precision science now.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden the
quantum revolution comes along.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:90%
That was about 100 years ago.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.555 align:middle line:90%
Those were explorers.

00:09:28.555 --> 00:09:29.596 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And they were
asking the right questions.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:90%
And they were open.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And they were putting
everything on the table

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.070 align:middle line:90%
to be re-evaluated.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was what really
drew me into physics

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:84%
in the first place,
is like, this, this

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:90%
is what I want to see.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And then yet, as I got
into graduate school,

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
it was like, we're not
doing that anymore.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:90%
We've accepted this.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.060 align:middle line:90%
This is how things are.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Now just pass your tests
and do your research.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.042 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And it's
very money driven.

00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:90%
The research that you--

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Jealously guarded
acquisition of evidence

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:90%
for something.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: And credibility.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Credibility is everything.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.132 align:middle line:84%
And if you lose your
credibility, if you research

00:10:06.132 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
fringe topics, you're going
to lose your credibility,

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
lose your funding,

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:90%
you're going to lose your job.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.607 align:middle line:84%
And it was just, to me, I
couldn't-- and there's so much.

00:10:13.607 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, but there
was a lot of arrogance.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:17.291 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Mental arrogance.

00:10:17.291 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And that closed-mindedness
started coming in.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So I had on one
hand, I was doing

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:90%
my research and my science.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing basic
physics, just really trying

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to understand fundamental
principles of creation

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.869 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other hand, I
had this spiritual side of life

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that started to awaken in me
and become really important

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
in my life, because
it was clear to me

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that it was a key of my sense
of purpose, and meaning,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:90%
and happiness.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was finding that my
passion and my creativity

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:90%
was reawakening.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Because through the
scientific way of thinking,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:84%
my creativity was
getting stomped out.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, waning, sure.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.443 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: It was
all left brain and I

00:10:55.443 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
was I was losing access to that
right brain way of working.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And then that the
spiritual work started

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:84%
bringing that right
brain connection,

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately whole
brain, back online.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And so all my creativity
was coming back.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:90%
My passion was coming back.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.379 align:middle line:84%
A sense of meaning and
purpose was coming back.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:90%
And then those were the fruits.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
My life started transforming
in a really good way.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, OK,
well, this is good.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Even though science can't
explain it, this is good.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It feels good is
evidentiary for you, yes.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 100 years ago,
even prior to that, late

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
1800s, early 1900s, it was
just a circus of so many

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:90%
different ideas and topics.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Understandings of
ancient knowledge

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
were being remembered
and bubbling up

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:90%
to the surface across the globe.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And also in the 16th
century, a lot of that

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
was going on in the time
of Sir Francis Bacon

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, the
Renaissance, absolutely.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And yet, now we're seeing
some of the most clo--

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:84%
really, on one level,
in terms of science

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:84%
itself discovering the great
mysteries in life-- really

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:90%
some of the most closed times.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think you made
a very wise decision.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And it took you into some
interesting directions.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
You went looking for your tribe.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.146 align:middle line:84%
And then you did a DNA Life
Activation, is that correct?

00:12:07.146 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, so
what happened was I

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
was getting really excited
by what I was learning.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted community.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to share.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I wanted people of like mind, or
my tribe, my spiritual family,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
where I could feel like, let's
have these conversations,

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.530 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't do that
in the physics department.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
to certain things

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
like a Center for
Spiritual Living,

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
or Church of Religious
Science, which was great.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But it was kind of
not hitting the depth

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:90%
that I was looking for.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:90%
And so I felt really isolated.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And so at one point, I just put
it out there to the universe,

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm really frustrated,
help me find my spiritual path,

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
help me find my
spiritual family, people

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:90%
that I can connect with.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
put it out there.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And then about two weeks
later, synchronicity led me

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
to somebody who offered this
thing called the DNA Life

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Activation.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was interested in this
idea of awakening that DNA

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.050 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All that
potential, yeah.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
all that potential.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that there
was more inside of me.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, I'm
open, let's try it.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I'd had lots of various
energy modalities done

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.687 align:middle line:90%
on me by that point.

00:13:08.687 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And some of them I
thought were great.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'd already been Reiki
attuned to level 2 Reiki

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:84%
practitioner, for
like 6 years prior.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
So I was into it.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet, some delivered
and some didn't.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So I went, OK, let's see
what it has to offer.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.289 align:middle line:90%
And I had that session.

00:13:25.289 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:84%
In the session, it
didn't necessarily

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:90%
blow me away in the moment.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was it?

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.747 align:middle line:84%
And what was it was supposed
to have accomplished?

00:13:31.747 --> 00:13:35.874 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, so it was
about a two-hour session.

00:13:35.874 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was all
this energy balancing.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So just balancing different
layers of the energy body,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and chakras, and
aura, and so forth.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
this activation part,

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:84%
where they actually go into the
third blueprints of the body

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and they turn on the light
switches that are supposed to--

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:90%
related to the pineal gland--

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that are supposed
to be connecting

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
in to the signals for the DNA,
and which parts of the DNA

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:90%
to be expressing.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And it works with the Tree
of Life and Kabbalistic

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:90%
understandings.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.861 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a very
ancient modality

00:14:03.861 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:84%
that goes back several
thousand years,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:84%
they say, that's been passed
down through the Mystery School

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.100 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.905 align:middle line:84%
And the practitioner had
these different modalities,

00:14:11.905 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and I was asking her, well,
what is this versus that?

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:90%
And where does this come from?

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And what's this
mystery school thing?

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had all kinds
of questions for her.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't really have a
whole lot of answers for me

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.420 align:middle line:90%
in the moment.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But afterwards, and for the
next four months, I kept seeing

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:90%
these changes happen in my life.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And I just had more
clarity come through.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:32.356 align:middle line:84%
I had insights into choices
I was making in my life,

00:14:32.356 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and what was serving me
and what wasn't serving me,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and how I might align
my life choices better

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
to be more supportive
of my higher potential.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a
sudden, I was making

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
all these little incremental
adjustments in my life,

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:90%
just intuitively.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And after about a month, I
look back, I'm like, wow.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It made a lot of
little adjustments.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It all started
with that day, yeah.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And it
all added up to be

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.070 align:middle line:90%
a pretty big change in life.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.278 align:middle line:84%
And then about four months
later, for the first time,

00:14:56.278 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I was able to say, oh, this
is what I'm here to do.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to bring the science
and the spirituality together,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:84%
which means I'm here to walk
a nontraditional track, rather

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.707 align:middle line:90%
than a traditional track.

00:15:06.707 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Because prior to
then, I didn't really

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:90%
know what I wanted to do--

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
receptive to that?

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, it was like,
oh, my passions, two passions

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.959 align:middle line:90%
coming together.

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:84%
But it means that
I'm not going to it

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.809 align:middle line:90%
the way they want me to do it.

00:15:17.809 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And I have to be OK with
that, which is a little scary.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah that's
what I was wondering.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It was really scary.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, then, I also
got into the Mystery School

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:90%
teachings of Kabbalah.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And through that process-- it
was a very experiential process

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:90%
of personal transformation--

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and through that process, I
was able to really peel away

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:90%
the layers of the fear.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And gain the courage to kind
of come out and just say,

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.025 align:middle line:84%
Hey, this is who I am,
because I was in the closet,

00:15:45.025 --> 00:15:48.704 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, as a scientist
in this community for a while.

00:15:48.704 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like,
I have to come out,

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
because I can't be at
odds with myself anymore.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And so it was just a
lot of personal work

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
of like really peeling
those layers away

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.780 align:middle line:90%
so that I could emerge.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:90%
And do what I was here to do.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And step off of the normal
track and pave a new way.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the Kabbalah
gave you a new framework.

00:16:10.055 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: A new
framework, yeah.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.471 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:16:13.471 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
different types

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.930 align:middle line:84%
of the way the Kabbalah is
experienced, expressed, used.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you talk about
is experiential Kabbalah.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.427 align:middle line:84%
So help define this
in people's minds,

00:16:25.427 --> 00:16:27.510 align:middle line:84%
because most people, if
they do know the Kabbalah,

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:84%
probably only know
one way of viewing it.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:90%
And the Tree of Life.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:90%
So go for it.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.655 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
So the community

00:16:35.655 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
I ultimately found my way to as
was The Modern Mystery School.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And they work more with
universal principles,

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and not so much with any
one religious approach.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So they've drawn from many
different ancient spiritual

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And in The Mystery
School really has kind of

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:84%
been a sponge to those
ancient spiritual traditions,

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and the tools and the
methods that are used.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But bringing it together
in a non-dogmatic way,

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:84%
a non-religious way,
but very spiritual.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the Kabbalah has been
drawn in to the mystery school

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
tradition, but almost like a
core framework for everything.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.160 align:middle line:10%
So everything becomes a
part of that framework

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:10%
of the Tree of Life.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:10%
But it's universal,
so it's not going

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:10%
to be according to any orthodox
Jewish mystical tradition,

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:10%
but it definitely has links in.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But they say that Universal
Kabbalah goes all the way back

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.168 align:middle line:84%
to the very beginning,
when we just

00:17:30.168 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
started to learn how to
ask the right questions

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and receive answers that would
help us to thrive in life.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:84%
That Kabbalah ultimately
is the study of life

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and how to live
life to the fullest.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the mystery
school tradition,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
they have a system
that they call

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:90%
ascending the Tree of Life.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Where we actually
energetically, step by step,

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.070 align:middle line:84%
ascend vibrationally, raise
the energy of the soul

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:84%
up the Tree of Life, and up
that pattern from being just

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
focused on the physical,
in our physical lives.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And working our
way up through each

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
of the 10 steps of
the tree until we

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:84%
can come back to connecting
a direct connection

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.010 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the tree,
which is our own divinity.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And along the way, it's
almost like your mind

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to work
according to this pattern.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet we get stuck
in certain places,

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
in certain old things
that we didn't resolve.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And so along the journey,
those energies get catalyzed.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the light
gets shined on them.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And you start to see
more clearly what's

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:84%
going on in you that
creates this disruption

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
or distortion of the energy
as it's flowing through

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:90%
into your life.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we learned about
Kabbalah by living it.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
experiential Kabbalah.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.181 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: That's experiential.

00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
As we ascend, and as we use the
tools in our own life daily,

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
then our life
becomes our mirror.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it's
already or mirror,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
but it's like there's this
amplification of awareness,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.020 align:middle line:84%
of what your life is
trying to show you

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates
to the Tree of Life.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
hard to explain,

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
but the journey
is pretty amazing.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So over 10 months, I
experienced 10 years

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:84%
worth of transformation
and shifting, just

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:90%
through that ascension process.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about for a moment,

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit,
because I know

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:84%
you can't take years of
training and crush it

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:90%
into a few minutes.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But maybe just give
us a little hint

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
of what some of the
practices, or protocols,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.064 align:middle line:90%
or tools in this process were?

00:19:19.064 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So they're
very similar tools

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that you might see in
a lot of practices.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:90%
So meditation is a piece of it.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.770 align:middle line:84%
There's rituals, rituals
in particular being one way

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
that we step into a more active
role and harness our own will.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:90%
And we use-- there's formulas.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.830 align:middle line:10%
So we would use formulas
according to the Tree

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:10%
of Life pattern, for example.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.924 align:middle line:10%
Activating those energy
centers on the body,

00:19:43.924 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:10%
working with something
called the Four Worlds,

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:10%
which is, how do we bring the
energies from the higher divine

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:10%
source of inspiration
down through the levels

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:10%
of our mind and our planning
and into actual manifestation?

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And how do we work with
this much more efficiently

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:90%
and effectively?

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
divine names that we

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
might tone that are
based on the Tree of Life

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and the Kabbalistic system.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so sacred word,
sacred ritual, meditation.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:84%
We also work with things like
there's the study portion

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and expanding your
concepts, there's

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:84%
working with your chi
and your vitality,

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
there's awakening
it in your DNA.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.261 align:middle line:84%
Because every time we're
working with the Tree of Life,

00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:90%
we're working with our DNA.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it's always waking up
and catalyzing these energies

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:90%
within you to transform.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in that, when I
was reading about your work,

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:84%
it was a type of
Kabbalah, and some

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:45.110 align:middle line:84%
of the mysteries that you were
expanding in your own awareness

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.895 align:middle line:84%
had to do-- dated back to
the days of King Solomon.

00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that a little bit,

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
because anyone that went to
Sunday school would say, what?

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:90%
King Solomon?

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
that means in your world.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Sure.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So yes, so there's the biblical
stories of King Solomon.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's the
King Solomon was wise.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And we have the story of
the two women and the baby,

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And that then there's also
stories, other stories.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So in the mystery school
tradition, King Solomon,

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:90%
there's oral teachings.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we get very
different oral teachings

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:84%
than what you might see
in the written history.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: But written
history is written by who?

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.204 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And from what
perspectives and filter?

00:21:27.204 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The victors.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
usually the victors.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's sometimes
the propaganda

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of this is the story
we want to tell,

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and then there's all
the censoring of, well,

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.196 align:middle line:84%
this is the other
side of the story that

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:39.530 align:middle line:90%
gets kind of censored out.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So we work with a lot
of oral teachings.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And they say that,
OK, so it didn't

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.940 align:middle line:90%
originate with King Solomon.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But King Solomon
was somebody who--

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:84%
so his father, King
David, was a Warrior King.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But King Solomon was maybe
more diplomatic or more wise.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And he had, according to our
teachings, he had a vision.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And in Kabbalah, they have
like a prophecy, or a teaching,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.990 align:middle line:84%
that at one point we
were in a divine state.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:90%
We were in the Garden of Eden.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And then something happened,
and we came out of that state.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:84%
We fell to a place where we're
in a denser state of being.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's the veils
that got put in place.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're now off to try and
create by our own efforts

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.882 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:25.882 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But there was always
a promise, according

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.131 align:middle line:84%
to the Kabbalistic
teachings, there's

00:22:29.131 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:84%
always a promise
to rediscovering

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:84%
those keys to reawakening
our full divine potential.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And they call it
the Adam Kadmon,

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:84%
which is like this perfected
human, this God human.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So King Solomon
had as his mission,

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:84%
how do we rediscover those keys
so that we can turn this on

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and we can then recreate that
heaven on earth experience?

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.637 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that Kabbalah
had certain keys,

00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:84%
but there were other
keys that were missing.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
gathering, a big gathering

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.900 align:middle line:90%
of the tribes from all over.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bible, it
does talk, it kind of

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:84%
mentions that, oh, he worshipped
pagan gods, and this and that.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But from our perspective,
it was well, no, there

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:84%
was an invitation
to all these sages,

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and priests, and priestesses
from all these other traditions

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:90%
who came together.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And they shared their teachings,
they shared their methods,

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:84%
they shared their secrets,
and they worked together

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:84%
for a common mission for over
the course of 20-plus years.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to test out
all these different modalities

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and teachings to find that
what universally works.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not about your bloodline,
it's not about your culture,

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:84%
it's not about your land,
it works on everybody.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And if it worked
on everybody, it

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.900 align:middle line:90%
became a part of this system.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was wise.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, and
it kind of reminds

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:84%
me of the time of Alexandria
and the Renaissance.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
It was one of those
times where there

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.280 align:middle line:84%
was a melding of these universal
teachings coming back together.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And so Universal Kabbalah
was one of those--

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:84%
like he made Kabbalah
be the framework

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:90%
that everything organized into.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, we take this
piece, and oh, that

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.050 align:middle line:84%
relates to this
part of the tree.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we take
this piece and that.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And I find that the
Tree of Life really

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:90%
is this organizing system.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:84%
You can take anything from life,
from physics, from psychology,

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.875 align:middle line:84%
from relationships,
and you can see it--

00:24:13.875 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Overlay it.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: --falls
into the tree of life.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.316 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:17.316 --> 00:24:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere along the way, the
oral tradition of Hermeticism

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:90%
came into your life.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah so in
the Mystery School,

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
they work with Hermetic
teachings, which go back even

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:90%
further than King Solomon.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
They just trace the lineage
to that time of King Solomon.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:84%
We work with Ancient
Egyptian teachings,

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
alchemical teachings,
various shamanic practices.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very broad sweep
of the different practices.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And to me personally, the
Hermetics and the alchemy

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
were really like
a key for me to be

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:84%
able to bridge the science
and the spirituality.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hermetics
for me, as well.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.509 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful bridge.

00:24:55.509 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
because it's working

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:58.100 align:middle line:90%
with those universal principles.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's just examining
the operating principles

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:90%
behind reality, right.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the word alchemy,
you just brought up

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and I said in the open of the
show is that a lot of people

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.740 align:middle line:84%
use the word alchemy, but
what's it actually mean, right?

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.921 align:middle line:84%
And if you go deep
into Hermetic studies,

00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:17.420 align:middle line:84%
it'll tell you,
literally, if you're

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.950 align:middle line:84%
looking at it from
a material level

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.800 align:middle line:84%
to a spiritual level,
what that means.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But you're using it in terms of
a way of helping us understand

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.860 align:middle line:84%
our own human evolution and
our human spiritual evolution

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
as well, cultural and
spiritual evolution.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's move forward to
game changers and then looked

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:84%
forward after that into
the seven alchemical steps.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So the kind of disillusionment
and recombining ourselves, OK?

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: OK, so with
alchemy, when I first

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.021 align:middle line:84%
was exposed to it
as a scientist,

00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, I
don't have anything

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.840 align:middle line:90%
to learn from these alchemists.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm a real scientist,
because we had been trained

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:90%
that is just pseudoscience.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And I kept pushing it
away, but the universe just

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:84%
kept bringing it up
and bringing it up.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked into
it, I realized, finally,

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.287 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, this is a gold mine.

00:26:08.287 --> 00:26:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Literally.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: There is so much
wisdom in here, literally.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And the wisdom is
the gold, I think.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: It's just like
it applied to everything

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:10%
that I was looking
for, especially

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:10%
for bridging the science
and the spirituality.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the primary
core of alchemy

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
is about the
transformation of the self.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And the perfection
of the our own soul

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:84%
to become the
Philosopher's Stone

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:38.480 align:middle line:84%
is, how do we really evolve and
achieve that full potential,

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:90%
that full perfection?

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet, alchemy
is so universal.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a way in which everything
evolves, and transforms,

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and grows into
that higher energy.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And so how do we apply
this into our lives.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:84%
You can, of course,
apply it into science,

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.146 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
science even came from,

00:26:58.146 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:90%
is the alchemical tradition.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:84%
We can apply it into our social
transformation as a collective.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And so alchemy applies
as at many levels.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And we think of alchemy
in its core essence

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:84%
as the process of
raising vibration.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned that people
are using this term really

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.520 align:middle line:90%
loosely these days.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.320 align:middle line:90%
And they are.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh,
everything's alchemical

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:90%
if it's transformative.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: In alchemy,
there is a science--

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.028 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very specific.

00:27:24.028 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It's very precise.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:84%
There's formulas and there's
a very specific sequence

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:84%
that you have to go through
to successfully make it

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.590 align:middle line:84%
all the way through the
transformational process.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about, at
the core of that formula

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.370 align:middle line:84%
is a Latin phrase called
Solve et Coagula, which means

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.170 align:middle line:90%
to take apart and recombine.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.890 align:middle line:84%
But in taking apart, you need to
then take those separate pieces

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and purify them.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So if we just take apart and
then we try to recombine,

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:84%
without doing the purification
and the refinements,

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:90%
it's not alchemy.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It just goes back into
a corrupted state.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Right, so
that purification process

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:84%
is at the core of what
happens with alchemy.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Purification and the
raising the vibration,

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:84%
bringing it to its
higher potential,

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%
then bringing things
back together.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we bring
it back together,

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:90%
again, it's really precise.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:10%
And it takes, they say,
in "The Emerald Tablet"

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.910 align:middle line:10%
that it has to be with great
skill or great ingenuity.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:10%
That we have to bring
things back together

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.120 align:middle line:10%
in perfect proportion,
perfect harmony,

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.522 align:middle line:10%
because we're trying to take
these oppositions, right.

00:28:23.522 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look
at our world today

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.271 align:middle line:90%
and there's so much opposition.

00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
polarization of things.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And alchemy, though,
thrives in that tension

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
between differences, that
tension of opposites.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
But we have to kind of separate
them out from each other,

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:84%
purify them to
their core essence,

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and then bring
them back together,

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:84%
so that the combined
whole will be greater

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:90%
than how it was previously.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as we
started the conversation,

00:28:47.945 --> 00:28:49.670 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about DNA.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
your DNA activation.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And now we get to this notion
that soul progression is very

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.680 align:middle line:90%
intimately linked with DNA.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about how we begin

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:84%
re-awakening, remembering,
activating, that quote,

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.200 align:middle line:84%
"95% junk DNA," which
I always thought

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:84%
was just hysterical
to begin with.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So yes, it's
typical limited mindset.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you don't
understand it, it's junk.

00:29:17.203 --> 00:29:18.003 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right.

00:29:18.003 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Right.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there's this
huge potential in our DNA

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're just not even--

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.790 align:middle line:90%
well, I think it's functional.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But we just don't understand--
scientists don't understand it.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:90%
But there's also--

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
working in the background,

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:90%
in the operating system.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're just not
aware of any of it.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.726 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Right,
we're not aware.

00:29:33.726 --> 00:29:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the DNA, in the
metaphysical understanding,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.215 align:middle line:84%
we relate the DNA
to the Tree of Life.

00:29:41.215 --> 00:29:42.590 align:middle line:10%
So the Tree of
Life would be like

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.720 align:middle line:10%
that core original
blueprint of who we are.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.490 align:middle line:10%
And it's physical, and it's
spiritual, and there's soul,

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.100 align:middle line:10%
and these are different
components of it.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And so our DNA, from the more
metaphysical perspective,

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.690 align:middle line:84%
is going to contain
everything about us.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
There's all of our physical,
everything about our bodies

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, but there's also
everything about your soul.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:09.284 align:middle line:84%
And how your perceiving
and your purpose,

00:30:09.284 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And what you're here to do
and the unique gifts that

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:12.542 align:middle line:90%
your spirit brings in.

00:30:12.542 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
things are written

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:90%
in that blueprint of you.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And so every time that we
work with the Tree of Life

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
it's communicating to your
DNA, because that Tree of Life

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:84%
is actually the scaffolding
or the sacred geometry that

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:84%
governs the construction
of the DNA double helix.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you take Tree of
Life, upon Tree of Life,

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
upon Tree of Life, upon Tree of
Life, it builds up that ladder.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you just give it a
right-handed clockwise twist,

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and then you have your two
strands of your double helix.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And then right down
the center core of that

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.050 align:middle line:90%
is all this light that runs.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it sounds like
what hasn't been as this is

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.710 align:middle line:90%
a multi-dimensional expression.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.404 align:middle line:84%
And because we're
only looking for DNA

00:30:51.404 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:84%
in the material third
dimensional realm.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Chemical.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't
see the rest of it.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:56.698 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right, yeah, yeah.

00:30:56.698 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there's many
dimensions, many, many--

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.150 align:middle line:90%
and also there's the--

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:06.800 align:middle line:84%
so the sacred geometry, the core
pattern that it's built around

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.430 align:middle line:84%
is actually more fundamental
than the biomolecules

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:90%
that shape the DNA.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.193 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely

00:31:12.193 --> 00:31:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Because it's not
just our deoxyribonucleic acid,

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:84%
it's also crystals
have DNA, everything

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.570 align:middle line:84%
that's physical has some kind of
DNA built around that pattern.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And so as we communicate
and work with that,

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:84%
we are communicating to the
proper programming of our DNA.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And then our DNA also
responds to words

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.510 align:middle line:90%
and the proper frequencies.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So as we attune
ourselves, as we are

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:84%
gaining that inner frequency--
and it needs to be coherent.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's this light
that can go into the DNA,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and be received by the DNA,
and also expressed by the DNA,

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:90%
that they call biophotons.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be coherent,
it's laser light.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's subtle.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But we have to achieve
a state of coherence

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.060 align:middle line:84%
within in order to
communicate to our DNA.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So we can't just
come from mind, have

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:03.710 align:middle line:84%
to come from every part of us is
in this united state of being.

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we bring in the proper
visuals, of the Tree of Life,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:84%
for example, or the proper
words of power or holy words

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:90%
that communicate to the DNA.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's where our chants can
come in, our meditations come

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:22.610 align:middle line:84%
in, rituals that work with that
Kabbalistic Tree of Life, which

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:84%
is, to me, it's not
just about Kabbalah.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a sacred geometry,
which is universal.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And any sacred
geometry, you know,

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:84%
there's different ones that
will work with different aspects

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:90%
of our beings.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.253 align:middle line:84%
OK, what I'd like you to
do, if you wouldn't mind,

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
is to use the beautiful
metaphor of the chrysalis

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and the butterfly, and imaginal
cells, and how, in the end,

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:44.441 align:middle line:90%
they are going to take over.

00:32:44.441 --> 00:32:46.190 align:middle line:84%
As you started from
the beginning, saying,

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
this transformation
is going to happen.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Either the slow way, the
hard way, or the fast way.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.997 align:middle line:90%
So let's use that metaphor.

00:32:52.997 --> 00:32:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: OK, so that
metamorphosis process

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:84%
of the caterpillar to
butterfly is alchemy.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And it's
a great example

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:01.730 align:middle line:90%
for what we go through, right.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So as the caterpillar,
it's like there's

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.040 align:middle line:84%
this clock that goes off
inside of it internally,

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.480 align:middle line:90%
know the DNA starts to change.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.314 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes and
makes its chrysalis,

00:33:10.314 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't know what
it's going to become,

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.420 align:middle line:84%
it's just kind of
settling down for a nap.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But inside that
chrysalis, it goes

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:90%
through a complete breakdown.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.932 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes a soupy mess.

00:33:19.932 --> 00:33:21.140 align:middle line:90%
If you open up the chrysalis.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Goo.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, it's total goo.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And then there is this
DNA, starts putting out

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.000 align:middle line:84%
a new signal for these
new cells to be developed

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:90%
that they call imaginal cells.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And the imaginal cells hold the
blueprint for the butterfly.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
kind of-- at first,

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.837 align:middle line:84%
the old cells think,
oh, this is a virus.

00:33:37.837 --> 00:33:39.920 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason that
everything's falling apart

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and they attack.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But then there's this
gathering in numbers

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:84%
where they can gain the strength
to form that new structure

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:90%
of the butterfly.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately, as that
new structure starts to emerge,

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:84%
the old cells kind of realize
like, OK, no matter what we do,

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:90%
we're falling apart here.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And we need to find--

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.410 align:middle line:84%
we need to repurpose ourselves
to this new structure,

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.080 align:middle line:90%
otherwise we die off.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
shift from fighting it

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.630 align:middle line:84%
to repurposing and
using those old skills

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:84%
to become a part of
the new butterfly.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, because a
digestive cell could still

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:90%
be a digestive cell.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:13.489 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.322 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Right, but
then in the butterfly,

00:34:15.322 --> 00:34:17.659 align:middle line:84%
there's new things like
the color, and the wings,

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:18.554 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:34:18.554 --> 00:34:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they have
to work together.

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:23.719 align:middle line:84%
So the old, like the
elders, and the new,

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:84%
who are the imaginal
cells of humankind,

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:84%
whether they're new generations,
like millennials and indigos,

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:31.940 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're
cultural creatives,

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.131 align:middle line:84%
they need to work
together to find that,

00:34:34.131 --> 00:34:35.630 align:middle line:84%
how do we bring in
the new paradigm,

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.320 align:middle line:90%
but also make it work?

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.127 align:middle line:90%
And in a way that is efficient.

00:34:39.127 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And have some
stable basis to work from.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And have a stable
structure to work from.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.801 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And then there's
still these processes

00:34:45.801 --> 00:34:47.552 align:middle line:84%
that it takes for the
butterfly to emerge.

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:48.384 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:34:48.384 --> 00:34:49.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful metaphor.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:90%
And also for society at large.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact
that you basically

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.570 align:middle line:84%
use that in terms
of societal growth,

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.240 align:middle line:84%
because we can see that
these new ideas that

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.690 align:middle line:84%
are coming forward from
all generations now.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.892 align:middle line:84%
These new questions,
these new expectations

00:35:04.892 --> 00:35:06.350 align:middle line:84%
are gaining in
numbers to the point

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.930 align:middle line:84%
where they can't
be suppressed now.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.070 align:middle line:90%
So we are going to--

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: All the
solutions are coming forward

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --transform.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: We have to.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's back
it up a little further.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:16.283 align:middle line:90%
We're going to back the lens up.

00:35:16.283 --> 00:35:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So your understanding
is that we as souls

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:24.290 align:middle line:84%
have gone through universal
experiences and understandings.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
now found ourselves

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.622 align:middle line:84%
in our current evolutionary
pattern, right, here on Earth.

00:35:31.622 --> 00:35:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And that ultimately,
we're destined

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.170 align:middle line:84%
to go back to our galactic
understandings in self.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So coming from
that point of view,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.610 align:middle line:84%
let's begin the alchemical
process, the beginning

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:41.900 align:middle line:90%
of the tearing apart.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: OK.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah, our ultimate
goal is towards our--

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.010 align:middle line:10%
we are galactic beings,
and we are divine beings--

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:50.840 align:middle line:10%
or eternal beings, right.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we are not
manifesting that right now.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And so in the alchemical
process-- and this

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.200 align:middle line:84%
is going to naturally
happen, no matter what.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
already-- like life,

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.040 align:middle line:84%
the universe is driving
this evolutionary process.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy is about
understanding that formula

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.880 align:middle line:90%
so that we can work with it.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So that we can harness
those natural processes.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And then by our own creative
efforts, we can speed it up.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So when we understand them, then
we can work in participation

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and speed it up.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it means
to be an alchemist.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.728 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're going to
be dragged there, anyway.

00:36:21.728 --> 00:36:23.511 align:middle line:84%
Might as well participate
in a proper way.

00:36:23.511 --> 00:36:25.385 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, and we
can get there faster.

00:36:25.385 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]
Right, exactly.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: We can get there
faster and hopefully smoother,

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.130 align:middle line:90%
in a smoother way.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if you just leave
it up to nature to do,

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.820 align:middle line:84%
you're going to wind up kind
of having to repeat, repeat,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:90%
repeat a lot.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And so the first step--

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:40.877 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people can
really probably relate

00:36:40.877 --> 00:36:42.710 align:middle line:84%
to this in their lives--
like the first step

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that we go through, when
it's time for transformation,

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:47.390 align:middle line:90%
is what we call Calcination.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:90%
It's like you get burned.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Something in your life just
gets shaken to the core.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And you feel like, you
know, like everything just

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.440 align:middle line:90%
got up rooted.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.195 align:middle line:84%
Like a big earthquake
in your life.

00:36:59.195 --> 00:37:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Or your ego gets burned, right.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.297 align:middle line:90%
And this is the Calcination.

00:37:03.297 --> 00:37:04.130 align:middle line:90%
This is the burning.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.422 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about burnt out?

00:37:05.422 --> 00:37:06.629 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It can be burnout.

00:37:06.629 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:90%
It can you just crash, right.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And so
that's the point where

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.469 align:middle line:90%
it's like it's a wake up call.

00:37:12.469 --> 00:37:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's saying you've
got to change some things.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.590 align:middle line:84%
You've got to look
at some things here,

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:84%
because it's not working
how it's going right now.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.307 align:middle line:90%
And you have to progress.

00:37:19.307 --> 00:37:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't progress,
and you stagnate,

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.000 align:middle line:84%
well the universe
is going to keep

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:84%
trying to send you events and
experiences that are going

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.660 align:middle line:90%
to catalyze that progression.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we go through
that burning.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the next stage
that usually comes up

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:35.030 align:middle line:84%
after the burn, and
feeling like the ego

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.250 align:middle line:84%
just got flared,
and so forth, is

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:38.960 align:middle line:90%
the emotion starts to rise up.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So the next stage is what
we called Dissolution.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And so there's things
from the subconscious

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.230 align:middle line:90%
that have been buried.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:84%
The impurities and things
that need to get cleaned out

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:84%
start to rise up to the
surface of our awareness.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very emotional
experience at first.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.312 align:middle line:84%
You know when you're
in emotion, and it's

00:37:57.312 --> 00:37:59.270 align:middle line:84%
like you just can't think
quite clearly, right.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're not necessarily
going to get clarity

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.320 align:middle line:84%
during this stage, but we
do feel the disillusionment,

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.120 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So it is a dissolution, and
things just kind of start

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve in terms of what
we thought our life was.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.338 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
this is how it was

00:38:12.338 --> 00:38:13.730 align:middle line:90%
and now it's all dissolving.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And we realize,
well, that's not--

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:18.220 align:middle line:90%
I can't rely on that anymore.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And so with the emotional stage,
or that Dissolution stage,

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.644 align:middle line:90%
we need to purify.

00:38:22.644 --> 00:38:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And we need to release
some of that stuff that

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.400 align:middle line:84%
was buried in the subconscious
that was driving the pattern.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Because we can't really--

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:32.210 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
act in our world

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:33.980 align:middle line:84%
if it's not in our
subconscious pattern.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:90%
It's just that's the filter.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have to clean
up that filter.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And then once we kind of move
through that Dissolution phase,

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.760 align:middle line:90%
we get the emotion out, usually.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And then as we release
that emotional charge,

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and some of this stuff
starts to stir up,

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.340 align:middle line:84%
then we can move
into the next stage,

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.540 align:middle line:90%
which is called Separation.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And Separation is
really just a process

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:59.960 align:middle line:84%
of patience and clarification,
letting the mind

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.144 align:middle line:90%
get more clear now.

00:39:01.144 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, what's what?

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.252 align:middle line:90%
What do we want to keep?

00:39:03.252 --> 00:39:04.460 align:middle line:90%
What do we need to let go of?

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Where are the impurities?

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:84%
We start separating out the
pieces, asking what's what.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And, OK, what parts
here are essential,

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.060 align:middle line:84%
but there's impurities in
there, and to just purify it.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:84%
What do I just completely
got to get rid of?

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we're trying
to really bring

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.260 align:middle line:84%
that purification of
those essential components

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.310 align:middle line:90%
into the picture.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Discernment.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:90%
Truth, discerning truth.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:24.755 align:middle line:90%
Your truth.

00:39:24.755 --> 00:39:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, discernment.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And deeper questioning, deeper
introspection, I would say,

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, well, what
really is it's true for me?

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was true,
but maybe it's not true.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.320 align:middle line:90%
And what do I really want to do?

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.740 align:middle line:84%
What really would you
know bring me joy or help

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.720 align:middle line:90%
me have a better life, right?

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that even in
the separation of alchemy

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.320 align:middle line:90%
and science and religion.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.779 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those things
separated out.

00:39:49.779 --> 00:39:50.578 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:50.578 --> 00:39:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: But we
need to at some point

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.497 align:middle line:90%
bring them back together now.

00:39:53.497 --> 00:39:55.330 align:middle line:84%
As science separated
out from the spiritual,

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:59.730 align:middle line:84%
it was able to really
master all the technology.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And this certain
way of doing things.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And that has advanced
us in many ways.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's gotten to the point
now where it's out of balance,

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:10.610 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.120 align:middle line:84%
It's so linear, logical,
rational, material,

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
spiritual guidance.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.590 align:middle line:84%
That needs that wisdom
of the spiritual side

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:90%
to come back in to guide.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.170 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to
use these technologies?

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to bring these
pieces back together again.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.440 align:middle line:90%
But in their core essence.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Not in their dogma, but
in their core essence.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that fourth stage is
the bringing back together.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So as we've purified, and as
we've clarified everything,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:84%
now we're going to bring the
pieces, those essential pieces,

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:90%
back together.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
call Conjunction.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.462 align:middle line:84%
And for us, personally, it's
where, OK, this is who I am.

00:40:46.462 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm going to do.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:90%
This is my new direction.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And we started to
feel more at ease

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and more centered
in ourselves again.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And we start to have
that sense of confidence.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.014 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a connection
to the deeper self.

00:41:01.014 --> 00:41:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We start really feeling
connected more to the higher

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.280 align:middle line:90%
self or more aligned.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where a lot
of people, though, get stuck.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Is they feel comfortable again
in this new conjunction stage.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's really beautiful.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But they go, OK, well,
I've done all this work.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.296 align:middle line:90%
And things are better now.

00:41:22.296 --> 00:41:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a sense
of myself now, yeah.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
I'm comfortable,

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting comfortable again,
things are going good again.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.650 align:middle line:90%
And then they stop the work.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.090 align:middle line:84%
They stop that
introspection, they

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:34.420 align:middle line:84%
stop doing the clearing, and
the more subtle impurities that

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:90%
need to be purified out.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.690 align:middle line:90%
And they just get comfortable.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And when they get
comfortable, what happens

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.240 align:middle line:90%
is they slide back.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And they have to go through
the first four steps again.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:43.830 align:middle line:84%
They can't really
progress forward

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:47.850 align:middle line:84%
until they really are
pushing at some higher level.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like we need that
spiritual fire to come in,

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.190 align:middle line:84%
that secret fire to
come in, and keep

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:54.690 align:middle line:90%
driving the alchemical process.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not
connecting and continuing

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to bring that spiritual
fire in, then it just

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.470 align:middle line:90%
sort of gets stuck.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And then the alchemy
experiment kind of fails

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and they got to
start over again.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.900 align:middle line:90%
So to move forward, we need to--

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.040 align:middle line:84%
we go into the next stage
called Fermentation.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is really relevant
to where we're at right now.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:84%
That the Fermentation
is a maturing process.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like how they take grapes
and then ferment it into wine.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's a maturing process.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.540 align:middle line:90%
And in that, it's slow.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a sort of a
slow-burning process.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a gentle heat that
just gradually purifies away

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.800 align:middle line:90%
those more subtle impurities.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.030 align:middle line:84%
That anything that
needs to rot or die,

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.915 align:middle line:84%
that isn't of the most core
essential part, has to go.

00:42:40.915 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you just said,
and that's where we are now.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Now you're speaking culturally?

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Are you speaking more globally
of the human civilization

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.250 align:middle line:90%
at large?

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.020 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean,
that's where we are now?

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.145 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, when I
look at where the world is,

00:42:54.145 --> 00:42:57.750 align:middle line:84%
because we have this big
process of evolution happening

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:58.890 align:middle line:90%
as a human race.

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:01.035 align:middle line:84%
When I look at where
the world is right now,

00:43:01.035 --> 00:43:02.660 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's
cycles within cycles,

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
so I can't say this
is exactly everything.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But we are in a phase where
Fermentation is very relevant,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.240 align:middle line:90%
it feels.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.900 align:middle line:84%
The Fermentation stage is
like a dark night of the soul.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And you're having to
face the corruption,

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:20.610 align:middle line:84%
you're having to face
the inner demons,

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.840 align:middle line:84%
you're having to face
what's not working.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to see that shadow
side that can't hide anymore.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's this struggle
between the light

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.380 align:middle line:90%
and the dark of the self.

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And as a collective,
like, that is happening.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.471 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: The shadow
doesn't hide anymore.

00:43:33.471 --> 00:43:34.650 align:middle line:90%
It's like in our faces.

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, every day.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Every day.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.119 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
turn your cell phone on

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:37.855 align:middle line:90%
and look at headlines.

00:43:37.855 --> 00:43:38.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] More than
ever, you know.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I think also because
of-- since the turn of the new

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.980 align:middle line:84%
millennium, things
have really been--

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.900 align:middle line:90%
we've been in a new cycle.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there's also the bigger
evolutionary cycle of humanity.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.632 align:middle line:84%
So that's that cycle
within the cycle.

00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But since the turn of
the new millennium,

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.940 align:middle line:84%
things have really
been speeding up.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And so we have the internet.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.234 align:middle line:84%
And that is creating a lot
more connection and a lot more

00:44:05.234 --> 00:44:06.150 align:middle line:90%
access to information.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot more fire.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.361 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: And a lot more fire.

00:44:08.361 --> 00:44:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot more, you know,
you can't hide anymore,

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.920 align:middle line:84%
because this is going to be
all over the internet within 24

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.280 align:middle line:90%
hours or less.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that is speeding
things up as well.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And so collectively, it's
like everything in our world

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:90%
has changed.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just look
back to 20 years ago

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.559 align:middle line:84%
and it's like it's a
completely different world.

00:44:27.559 --> 00:44:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And technology
keeps speeding up.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.337 align:middle line:84%
And just within five years
from today, you know,

00:44:32.337 --> 00:44:33.920 align:middle line:84%
the Futurists are
all saying our world

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.586 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
completely different just

00:44:35.586 --> 00:44:36.880 align:middle line:90%
in five years away.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's how fast and
rapidly we're transforming.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:43.410 align:middle line:84%
But in the Fermentation,
it's like whatever corruption

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.047 align:middle line:84%
is driving that,
it's like we can't

00:44:46.047 --> 00:44:47.130 align:middle line:90%
get to those final stages.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.255 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has to go now.

00:44:48.255 --> 00:44:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: So it has to go.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it can be an
uncomfortable process.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Because as we're
fighting, as some people

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.357 align:middle line:84%
are fighting to hold onto the
old structure, the old system.

00:44:58.357 --> 00:45:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there's other people
who are coming and saying,

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:84%
no, let's go for
the new paradigm.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And that struggle
that's happening there

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.940 align:middle line:84%
makes this Fermentation
stage really uncomfortable.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
pain in the process.

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it seems like
it's also distilling down

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.760 align:middle line:90%
to the individual level.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.110 align:middle line:84%
As the masses go through this,
so does the individual, more

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:21.049 align:middle line:90%
than I've ever seen.

00:45:21.049 --> 00:45:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yep, for sure.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:23.630 align:middle line:90%
And we're all one.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So we're all
part of that collective.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever's happening
at the global level,

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.030 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing
individually.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
that is that if we

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.404 align:middle line:84%
can shift it individually,
we're contributing

00:45:34.404 --> 00:45:35.300 align:middle line:90%
to the global shift.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.513 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And that
hundredth monkey effect,

00:45:37.513 --> 00:45:40.540 align:middle line:84%
or critical mass, that when
enough people have individually

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.560 align:middle line:84%
made that shift and we've
chosen the higher vibration,

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and we've done the
hard work that it takes

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.900 align:middle line:84%
to purify and to refine, and
to raise up to those higher

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.150 align:middle line:84%
levels, then we're
contributing to the mass

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:55.220 align:middle line:84%
being able to shift in
a more spontaneous way.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:56.095 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Because not everybody
is going to do this work.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But there are those
who are willing to

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:01.019 align:middle line:90%
and who are ready to.

00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming
forward right now.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
we're not done yet.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.760 align:middle line:90%
That was only the fifth step.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.468 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: That was
only the fifth stage.

00:46:06.468 --> 00:46:08.431 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] So
far, and oh my god, yeah.

00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And it's the a
long dark night of the soul.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So it can take some time
to get through that stage,

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's like everything
that doesn't serve that highest

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:16.680 align:middle line:90%
potential has to die.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.860 align:middle line:90%
It has to go.

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:23.962 align:middle line:84%
And it really takes a lot
of effort to root it out.

00:46:23.962 --> 00:46:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of it's really
blaring and in your face.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And other parts of
those corruption

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:29.780 align:middle line:90%
can actually be really subtle.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.196 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes as things there's
things that we think are good.

00:46:32.196 --> 00:46:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Like at a personal
level, sometimes there's

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:36.220 align:middle line:84%
things we think about
ourselves, oh, this

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.630 align:middle line:90%
is a good aspect of me.

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:39.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a good part
of my personality.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's my strength.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:42.360 align:middle line:90%
But we have an attachment to it.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:44.896 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And in that
attachment, when we identify,

00:46:44.896 --> 00:46:46.060 align:middle line:90%
we're limiting ourselves.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And so with that Fermentation
and that death process,

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.500 align:middle line:90%
we have to let go all of it.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.910 align:middle line:84%
We have to let go of
any limitation that

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:55.120 align:middle line:90%
holds us in this humanness.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
stories we tell ourselves

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.370 align:middle line:90%
are down pat, more or less.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:03.081 align:middle line:84%
They've been, often,
if you look back,

00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:05.455 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the subject of
reincarnation, for example.

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:06.871 align:middle line:84%
There are stories
we may have been

00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:08.920 align:middle line:84%
reinforcing, even for
other lifetimes, not

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.580 align:middle line:90%
just in this lifetime.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:11.920 align:middle line:90%
And so we're familiar with it.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Our feelings are
almost disconnected.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.610 align:middle line:90%
It's now our story.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, with every
one of these processes,

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.610 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me, we
would all greatly

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:26.620 align:middle line:84%
benefit from going through
the process of feeling.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Not emotions, but genuinely
allowing our tuning

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.160 align:middle line:84%
fork to reflect back how we feel
at every one of these points.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.630 align:middle line:90%
And at every decision point.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the information
is always right there.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.420 align:middle line:84%
But we're so cut off
from our feelings, which

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.790 align:middle line:84%
are going to give us proper
guidance as we get to each

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:47.560 align:middle line:90%
of these questions, right?

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, so as
we're too focused outwardly

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.950 align:middle line:84%
on news, and outward
stimulation, and all of this

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.740 align:middle line:84%
that's going on
outside, we're denatured

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.170 align:middle line:90%
from what's going on in here.

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:59.170 align:middle line:90%
And our body is a detector.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Our body, our nervous
system, and our senses,

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and our spiritual senses that
come in through the soul,

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:90%
it's always communicating to us.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And I see this in
people's journey

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.900 align:middle line:84%
of ascending the
Tree of Life a lot,

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.690 align:middle line:84%
because the tree also
is these major energy

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.600 align:middle line:90%
centers on the body.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And it has these
correspondences where

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.866 align:middle line:84%
if there's an issue in
that part of the body,

00:48:19.866 --> 00:48:21.490 align:middle line:84%
it's telling you
something that relates

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:22.531 align:middle line:90%
to that part of the tree.

00:48:22.531 --> 00:48:23.600 align:middle line:90%
And it never fails.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, but it
started more subtly.

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking, that feeling
was happening somewhere else.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.820 align:middle line:10%
Maybe a subtle
feeling of the heart.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.550 align:middle line:10%
A subtle, almost
feeling like an emotion,

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:35.050 align:middle line:10%
blowing through or
passing through,

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:36.577 align:middle line:10%
a whisper of some kind.

00:48:36.577 --> 00:48:39.160 align:middle line:10%
And it happens often enough, you
don't listen for long enough.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.076 align:middle line:10%
And it'll ultimately
settle somewhere a little

00:48:41.076 --> 00:48:42.370 align:middle line:10%
more dense, right.

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:45.304 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, so it starts at
these higher spiritual levels.

00:48:45.304 --> 00:48:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And then it works its
way into the mind.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we ignore it
in the mind, then it

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.300 align:middle line:90%
works its way to the emotions.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.466 align:middle line:84%
If we ignore it there, it
works its way to the body.

00:48:51.466 --> 00:48:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's coming through these
different density layers

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:54.910 align:middle line:90%
until it manifests.

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:57.397 align:middle line:84%
And if it manifests
as a physical disease,

00:48:57.397 --> 00:48:59.230 align:middle line:84%
that means we've ignored
it for a long time.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
so the real game

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.340 align:middle line:84%
is to catch it when
it is in these finer

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.770 align:middle line:90%
whispers from the soul.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.062 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, and we have
to be tuned in enough in--

00:49:07.062 --> 00:49:09.061 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll talk
about that in a minute,

00:49:09.061 --> 00:49:11.124 align:middle line:84%
once we get through the
seventh and final step.

00:49:11.124 --> 00:49:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, because
our mind needs to be quiet.

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:14.249 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:14.249 --> 00:49:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And our heart
needs to be open, right?

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:19.540 align:middle line:84%
We can't access that
just from the mind.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely that feeling
of the body and the heart

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.900 align:middle line:84%
being open, and tuning
into the subtleties.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
found, as a scientist,

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.870 align:middle line:84%
like we're trained to--
it's got to be tangible,

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.200 align:middle line:90%
it's got to be physical.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.540 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be real.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But I've found that the bigger
truth is in the subtlety.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.665 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And it
takes a lot of effort

00:49:40.665 --> 00:49:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to really tune in and
trust, to trust it.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It does,
because you have to--

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.630 align:middle line:84%
most of us need
evidence, just like you

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:47.800 align:middle line:84%
needed a certain amount of
evidence in your journey.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.409 align:middle line:84%
We need to see that
our perceptions

00:49:49.409 --> 00:49:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and other subtle feelings
have been correct in the past

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:52.924 align:middle line:90%
and let us the right way.

00:49:52.924 --> 00:49:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
paying attention

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to where you have been validated
through these feelings,

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:58.900 align:middle line:84%
you're not likely to rely
on them down the road.

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
the validation part

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.252 align:middle line:84%
is really important for
developing that connection

00:50:03.252 --> 00:50:04.210 align:middle line:90%
to the inner intuition.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:06.530 align:middle line:90%
So that was--

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:08.750 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we have now--

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:12.400 align:middle line:84%
the show, Fermentation,
the final purification,

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.769 align:middle line:90%
now we go to Distillation.

00:50:13.769 --> 00:50:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, so
the fermentation stage,

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:19.850 align:middle line:84%
we know when it's done, when
there's no more impurities.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.120 align:middle line:90%
And we have usually a vision.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.354 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind of spiritual
vision that comes in.

00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And in alchemy,
they would call it

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:26.561 align:middle line:84%
like the yellow sage
or the peacock's tail,

00:50:26.561 --> 00:50:27.650 align:middle line:90%
there's all this color.

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's this, you
know, oh, OK, there's

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.650 align:middle line:84%
a real sign of some
kind that stage is done.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And then as we go
into Distillation,

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Distillation is this
process of taking it

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.030 align:middle line:90%
from physical up to the subtle.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And then from the subtle
back down to the physical.

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go through
lots of rounds of distilling.

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And when it evaporates,
or when it rises up

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to those more subtle planes,
you can absorb the influence

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.620 align:middle line:90%
of the higher spiritual.

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
condense, or as we

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:00.010 align:middle line:84%
come back down to the physical,
it's like we're birthing it.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:03.480 align:middle line:84%
We're embodying
it into our life.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And so one way through
a lot of meditation,

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:08.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, you raise
your consciousness up

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and you receive all this
spiritual illumination.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.169 align:middle line:84%
But the next key is you
can't just be in bliss state.

00:51:13.169 --> 00:51:14.960 align:middle line:84%
You've got to bring it
down to the physical

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.440 align:middle line:90%
and put it into action.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Marry the
two worlds, absolutely.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.261 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, and if we don't
put into action and live it,

00:51:19.261 --> 00:51:20.180 align:middle line:90%
it's not manifested.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not fully realized, right.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.260 align:middle line:90%
So Distillation is this process.

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is where we
really raise the vibration.

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:29.660 align:middle line:84%
That as we bring spirit
or heaven to Earth,

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.820 align:middle line:84%
then it raises the
vibration of the Earth.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But then we have to go up
again and bring it down again.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And go up-- and so we go
through several levels

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:40.135 align:middle line:84%
of this process of refining and
maturing, and then perfecting.

00:51:40.135 --> 00:51:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
a lot of people

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:44.680 align:middle line:84%
think they've reached it once
they get to the bliss bunny

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.267 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:51:46.267 --> 00:51:47.850 align:middle line:84%
We've all been there
at certain times.

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh,
well I saw all this.

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:90%
This is so amazing.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is your
life is maybe dysfunctional,

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:56.480 align:middle line:84%
your life on Earth,
on the ground,

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.370 align:middle line:90%
is not working well for you.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And so you're absolutely right.

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:03.800 align:middle line:84%
The marriage of the two is
that beautiful opportunity

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.850 align:middle line:90%
of being human.

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:06.891 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, and that's
one of the big things

00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:10.520 align:middle line:84%
that we focus on in Kabbalah
and Western mysteries tradition

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.997 align:middle line:84%
in general, I would
say, are really

00:52:12.997 --> 00:52:14.330 align:middle line:90%
about how do we live it in life?

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Right, so
we can be spiritual

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and blissed out on
the mountaintop,

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and living a monastic
life, and that's beautiful,

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.570 align:middle line:84%
we can attain
enlightenment that way.

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:23.120 align:middle line:90%
But does it change the world?

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.920 align:middle line:84%
One person doing that
may not change the world.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.490 align:middle line:84%
So how do we bring that
enlightenment state down

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:29.990 align:middle line:84%
into the physical
world and actually

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:31.620 align:middle line:84%
make heaven on
Earth for everybody,

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.940 align:middle line:90%
not just for the individual.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
change the corrupt systems

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and institutions that
are no longer serving us.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.520 align:middle line:84%
That takes a lot of people
bringing that finer knowledge

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.720 align:middle line:90%
down into this plane.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.095 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
and in some ways

00:52:43.095 --> 00:52:46.430 align:middle line:84%
it's harder to maintain that
heightened enlightenment

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:47.630 align:middle line:90%
state in the world.

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:49.651 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Because
it drags you down.

00:52:49.651 --> 00:52:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to go
through the purification.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I find
that when you do,

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.770 align:middle line:84%
your baseline for your quality
of life raises and raises

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:57.680 align:middle line:90%
and raises.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It raises, yes.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And
this is ascension.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.018 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of people
talk about ascension.

00:53:01.018 --> 00:53:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Ascension means taking
the body with us

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and raising it to
those higher planes.

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:07.925 align:middle line:84%
It's not about escaping the
body, or being disembodied

00:53:07.925 --> 00:53:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and in this enlightenment
state, you've

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:10.664 align:middle line:90%
got to be grounded in it.

00:53:10.664 --> 00:53:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and yet
some of the great traditions

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:15.110 align:middle line:84%
of the world,
ancient traditions,

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.510 align:middle line:84%
are really all about if you
can do this thing right you

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.670 align:middle line:84%
can escape this trap,
this prison, that you're

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:21.470 align:middle line:90%
in here on Earth.

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:22.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the same page you are.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.670 align:middle line:84%
If you've chosen to be
embodied on this planet,

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:30.694 align:middle line:84%
what better way to
utilize your time here

00:53:30.694 --> 00:53:33.110 align:middle line:84%
than to try to bring the higher
principles into this life.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.667 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, anything
moving upward is ascension.

00:53:35.667 --> 00:53:37.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're
going to suddenly

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:40.070 align:middle line:84%
be a shimmery, fifth or
sixth-dimensional being when

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:42.650 align:middle line:84%
you wake up one day because
the spacecraft has arrived,

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.176 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, essentially
beamed us to a new level.

00:53:45.176 --> 00:53:46.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
work like that.

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So I like the pragmatic
aspects of what you're saying.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: And I find that--

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.700 align:middle line:84%
personally, I have experienced
that no matter how good I am,

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:53.540 align:middle line:90%
there is always the next.

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: There's always
those layers deeper.

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:59.142 align:middle line:84%
And so when we think,
"I've arrived,"

00:53:59.142 --> 00:54:00.600 align:middle line:84%
we've just stopped
our progression.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: We've just stagnated.

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's why I don't
like the word enlightenment.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yes.

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't care for it.

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:09.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not in my vocabulary
because I don't believe

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:10.500 align:middle line:90%
there is any such thing.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I believe there is a process
of going through enlightening

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.230 align:middle line:90%
one's self.

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:16.760 align:middle line:90%
But not an end point.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.442 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: We have
a teaching that I

00:54:18.442 --> 00:54:20.150 align:middle line:84%
was exposed to through
the Mystery School

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that I really loved, because
it really touches on this.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.130 align:middle line:84%
That if we want
to really ascend,

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and this is a big part of
what we do in the Experiential

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah, is we
gather knowledge.

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to
progress that knowledge

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.110 align:middle line:90%
to understanding.

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And you don't understand it
unless you've really lived it,

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:35.330 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
test it, apply it,

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:39.045 align:middle line:84%
perfect to your
own mastery of it.

00:54:39.045 --> 00:54:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you've really mastered
that, or really lived it,

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.680 align:middle line:90%
then you understand.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.970 align:middle line:90%
But that's not enough, either.

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:46.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to then raise
up the vibration.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And the way to raise the
vibration is to serve with it.

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: To bring
that to others as well.

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And then through that service
to others, we gain wisdom.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But when you've
achieved wisdom, you've

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.610 align:middle line:84%
got to realize that you
have to empty your cup,

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and seek new knowledge,
and continue that process.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And we just continue, and
continue, and continue,

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.950 align:middle line:90%
and that ascends.

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:05.616 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's one
thing I've learned,

00:55:05.616 --> 00:55:08.210 align:middle line:84%
is that the greatest being, some
of the nonphysical that I've

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:10.490 align:middle line:84%
ever had any communication
with, will say,

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.140 align:middle line:90%
there is no end to this.

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:13.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no end.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Don't be looking for that.

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Only be looking for refinement.

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right.

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.053 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:55:17.053 --> 00:55:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And if
we are eternal,

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and if we are these
divine gods and goddesses,

00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.209 align:middle line:84%
or these amazing beings,
our potential is limitless.

00:55:24.209 --> 00:55:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's limitless.

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.715 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It's limitless.

00:55:25.715 --> 00:55:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's pretty beautiful,

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.340 align:middle line:84%
why do you need an
end to that, right?

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Limitless potential.

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, we have our final step.

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
so our final step

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.690 align:middle line:84%
is the Coagulation, at
where we crystallize,

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and we bring everything into
that final perfected form.

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Now for us, that would be
the perfection of the soul.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.550 align:middle line:90%
But again, that's one level.

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So you know a lot of
people are very focused

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:50.880 align:middle line:84%
on their progression
as humans on Earth.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.840 align:middle line:90%
But that's just Earth system.

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not your other half.

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:56.763 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So as you go
forward, the galactic, you know,

00:55:56.763 --> 00:55:58.830 align:middle line:84%
our next evolutionary
step as a human race

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:02.550 align:middle line:84%
is to go beyond Earth,
to become more galactic.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Or to realize we
already are galactic.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.200 align:middle line:84%
That we've already
had that connection.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And now we're just having this
sort of experience on Earth,

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.780 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to go
into the next level of it,

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.890 align:middle line:90%
even beyond this Earth.

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And we get so caught up in
these bodies, in this density.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:19.050 align:middle line:90%
But this is not who we are.

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.150 align:middle line:84%
This is just an
experience we're having.

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we were evolving
to that next level

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:27.420 align:middle line:84%
of our galactic being, that
we're one with the universe.

00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So not only is it the
collective of each human having

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.370 align:middle line:84%
an impact on the collective,
and the collective having

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:37.939 align:middle line:84%
an impact on the human, but we
have an impact on the universe.

00:56:37.939 --> 00:56:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
has an impact on us.

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's that awareness of
all the inter-dimensional,

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.250 align:middle line:90%
intergalactic connections.

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond that
is that eternal being.

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Going back into where it's
limitless and it's all one.

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:51.960 align:middle line:90%
So the perfection state--

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.650 align:middle line:84%
in alchemy, you'd go through
many rounds of the first six

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:58.380 align:middle line:84%
steps before you really
reach that Coagulation,

00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.240 align:middle line:90%
that perfection.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And as we were just saying,
it's like once you arrive,

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.660 align:middle line:90%
you're not done.

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're not done.

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.185 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Even if you arrive.

00:57:05.185 --> 00:57:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just that
level of perfection.

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
even if you arrive

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:08.844 align:middle line:84%
at that level of
perfection, it's

00:57:08.844 --> 00:57:11.850 align:middle line:84%
like your whole being
becomes about serving

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and bringing, spreading that
perfection now to others,

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:15.090 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So we hold that
state in that light.

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But then our role is
to serve and to help

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:22.180 align:middle line:84%
others to also accomplish
that, because we're all one.

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: When we realize
that we're all one,

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I can't look at my
brother or sister

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and see them and
in a lower state

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and not want to help them up,
because your pain is my pain.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the, yeah,
those are the seven steps.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Those are beautiful.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I think those are very
incredibly useful for people,

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to explain how we go
through this process.

00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves a takeaway.

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So with all of this, we've
put people through their paces

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.990 align:middle line:84%
on this one, something
very, very simple

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:53.830 align:middle line:84%
you find is universal, in
either its healing or uplifting

00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:54.630 align:middle line:90%
effect?

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: OK, so working
with sacred geometry

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:57.835 align:middle line:90%
is very universal.

00:57:57.835 --> 00:57:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can work with
the whole Tree of Life,

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.990 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about during
some of this process.

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But usually, we
start with more what

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:06.810 align:middle line:84%
we call the three primary
keys, which are the three most

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:09.750 align:middle line:84%
basic sacred geometries,
which is triangle, square,

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:10.590 align:middle line:90%
and circle.

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:12.256 align:middle line:84%
So there's an activation
method that you

00:58:12.256 --> 00:58:14.940 align:middle line:84%
can do where you draw
these triangle, square,

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.260 align:middle line:90%
and circle in your hands.

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And part of the way
that you do it is you

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.810 align:middle line:84%
go from left to right, and
up to the middle finger.

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you come back
to the bottom left corner

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:24.974 align:middle line:90%
and you go up.

00:58:24.974 --> 00:58:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
specific way that you

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.320 align:middle line:84%
have to draw each
sacred geometry for it

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.192 align:middle line:84%
to kind of open the
door the right way.

00:58:30.192 --> 00:58:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And then for the square,
you go, again, left to right

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.275 align:middle line:84%
across the bottom, and
up, and then come back

00:58:34.275 --> 00:58:37.200 align:middle line:84%
to that lower left
corner, up and across.

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you do the
circle clockwise

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.720 align:middle line:90%
and a dot in the middle.

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you do it on the
same, on the other palm.

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we call the
Shambhala codes activation.

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:52.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then the key is to
bring it together at the heart.

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And like really just
build that heart energy up

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and expand this ball
of energy and light.

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And expand, and expand,
and expand, fill your aura,

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:05.070 align:middle line:84%
fill your space around
you, fill your whole body

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:06.630 align:middle line:90%
with that light.

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And then as you expand
it, and just really

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:11.274 align:middle line:84%
feeling that heart
centered energy,

00:59:11.274 --> 00:59:13.440 align:middle line:84%
than the next piece is to
go and touch other people.

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.006 align:middle line:90%
So if I can just touch you.

00:59:15.006 --> 00:59:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's just to
share the light.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.450 align:middle line:90%
And let that spread.

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Because through that touch,
my biophotons and DNA touches

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.600 align:middle line:90%
yours.

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.250 align:middle line:90%
And there's an awakening.

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.440 align:middle line:90%
There's an activation.

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.815 align:middle line:84%
So this is something simple
that we can do for ourselves.

00:59:29.815 --> 00:59:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's also
about spreading it.

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's universal.

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:33.393 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Very universal.

00:59:33.393 --> 00:59:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And shared.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts in
just a few seconds?

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Just that
we have to transform.

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:41.860 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: Because is
changing so rapidly.

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.880 align:middle line:10%
And we need to direct
it in a good way.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.250 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah.

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:44.535 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:44.535 --> 00:59:45.345 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: It's been a pleasure.

00:59:45.345 --> 00:59:46.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's been
a pleasure talking with you

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:47.780 align:middle line:10%
