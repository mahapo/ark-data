00:00:27.147 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Toward the end goal

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:10%
of affirming the
multi-dimensionality of life

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
and non-linear
timelines, we've recently

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:10%
explored the world
of apparitions

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:10%
with a couple of our guests.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:84%
To add to the understanding
of our interface

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
with these realms, we talked
today with Christopher Moon.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:84%
In his work recording
conversations

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
with spirits from
days long gone,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:84%
he uses a device called
the spirit phone.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS MOON: Thank you.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Actually, I think
you have another name for it

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:90%
too, don't you?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.756 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: It has several
names, actually, yeah.

00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us the
aliases for the device.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.296 align:middle line:10%
>>MOON: Well, it
started as Frank's box.

00:00:57.296 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:10%
That's originally
how it started.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.009 align:middle line:10%
Then the telephone to the dead,
and also the spirit phone.

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:10%
Good.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:10%
So anytime we use those terms,
it's all about the same device.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.362 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about you for a little bit

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
first, because I mean, as
we go through this story,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see
a theme emerging

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
about the ability for
this technology to work.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And some of it has to do also
with your own background.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And let's start from
the age of seven,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.857 align:middle line:84%
seeing an apparition standing
at the end of your bed,

00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to go into the
family dynamics and everything.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.981 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Sure.

00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I had my first conscious
paranormal experience

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:10%
when I was seven years old.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:10%
And as you mentioned,
we had just

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:10%
moved into a house in
Inglewood, Colorado.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:10%
There was nothing scary
or spooky about it.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:10%
It just had a feeling to it.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.169 align:middle line:10%
And it was summertime
when we moved in.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:10%
And we had no air conditioning
in the house whatsoever.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So we had all the windows
open, and basically

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
just tried to get a breeze
going through on that night.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I remember laying there,
and were living up

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:90%
on top of a hill.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And then back behind us was
a creek with water and trees,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and then there was a restaurant
and bar back behind us.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And I could your
glasses clinking,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and people talking,
and eventually, just

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.831 align:middle line:84%
opened my eyes just to
see what was in the room,

00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:07.205 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
three dimensional

00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:84%
shadow of a little boy just
standing there, staring at me.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Didn't say a word, just looked
at me, stood and stared.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And it scared me to
death, obviously.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning,
I went to my father,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:84%
a devout Catholic,
devout skeptic.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Dad, there's
a ghost in my room.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, son, the only
ghost is the Holy Ghost.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was in
trouble at that point.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the clinking
of glasses and such

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about,
were those from the house?

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: They were actually
from the bar back behind us.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And they had just been enough
to wake me up at that point.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just so you
could be alerted to this.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.151 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk about the
little boy for a moment who

00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:90%
was standing there.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, it
was just a shadow,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and I really didn't have
a bad feeling about it.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:84%
It was just so shocking
and frightening,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
because I'd never had
an experience before.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.702 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't until
later that my mother

00:02:56.702 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
had done some
research on the land,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and found out that we are
actually living on Arapahoe

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Indian burial ground.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.167 align:middle line:84%
We were actually living
on the mound on the hill.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we realized
that this was probably

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of this little
Indian boy who'd been there.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point,
the communication

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.552 align:middle line:90%
continued, and increased.

00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm just reflecting.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Even in Sedona, out at
some of the ancient sites,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
like Palatki, when
you go into the spaces

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
where they once
lived and meditate,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.866 align:middle line:84%
everything comes back very
fully and graphically.

00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:34.185 align:middle line:84%
I remember being there,
and seeing the elder mother

00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:37.455 align:middle line:84%
of a girl giving birth, all
kinds of interesting details

00:03:37.455 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:90%
of life back then.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Is there something unique
to Native American land

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
where the belief in
connection with the ancestors

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.812 align:middle line:90%
is so strong?

00:03:46.812 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: It's exactly
what you said.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I think their tie-in
with the earth

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and the spirituality
of the earth really

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.220 align:middle line:90%
just reflects back out.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
We found out that we
see those reflections

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:84%
on a consistent basis when we
do paranormal investigations.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's kind of a
hotbed for paranormal activity.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.319 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Always, always.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.734 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just going out to
native lands, or former native

00:04:05.734 --> 00:04:06.444 align:middle line:90%
lands anyway.

00:04:06.444 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.693 align:middle line:84%
I know there's been
quite a few horror

00:04:08.693 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:90%
movies based on that too.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they certainly
are in a business sense.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
In Sedona, when you
build on those lands,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
bad things often happen to
the businesses, we've noticed,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%
or the golf courses.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: It's very true.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And for example, we have
the Cheeseman Park Area here

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.840 align:middle line:90%
in Colorado.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And in Denver, that used to be
Arapahoe Indian land out there,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and they turned it
into a cemetery.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
there's the story

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that the movie
"Poltergeist" was based on,

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.812 align:middle line:84%
where they were paid to remove
all the bodies to turn it

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
into a park, but they
didn't remove the bodies.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.519 align:middle line:84%
They actually just
left most of the bodies

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and had the headstones removed.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's still
activity out there today.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.387 align:middle line:84%
And they still from time
to time will find a body.

00:04:50.387 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've gotta be
careful with this stuff.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
As we're going to find
out, not to be played with.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was the beginning of
a lot of inexplicable events.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And talk about what
started blossoming

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
from there, what kind of
events you were experiencing.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, it really
went from the visual

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
to actually starting to
see things happening.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:84%
We were actually able to
see objects that would just

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:90%
disappear in front of us.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:84%
They would be there, and
then just not be there,

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and they would return sometime
later in the exact same spot.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.527 align:middle line:84%
We actually had a piano in
that house that played itself.

00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to ask you about that.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Yeah,
everybody in the house

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
heard it play, including
my skeptical father.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.492 align:middle line:84%
And no one was able
to get out of bed

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:30.991 align:middle line:84%
to see what was
going on, but we all

00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
heard it and reflected
on it the next morning

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:90%
when we talked about it.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So it was a natural
progression from there.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But the thing was
interesting for me

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
is that my mother, being a
psychic, kind of a closet

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%
psychic, was nurturing
me on one side,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.440 align:middle line:84%
but my father was
really trying to tell me

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that I was crazy, that
all these things really

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:90%
weren't happening.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.007 align:middle line:90%
So I was trying to--

00:05:51.007 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Yeah, I was
trying to shut it down.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
dissonance and confusion

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:90%
in you, when you're young.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.732 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Absolutely,
especially at that age,

00:06:00.732 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:84%
where you're really
looking for direction

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and trying to learn about
these types of things.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So I really focused
my energy, I guess

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:84%
you could say, into
music at that point.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And I started playing
music at a very early age.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we're
going to get into that.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
The dynamic between your
mom and dad, I mean,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:84%
were they are able
to live peacefully

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:90%
with these divergent viewpoints?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Well, they were.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.929 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting,
because they were just

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:90%
polar opposites of each other.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
My mother never told my father,
well, until recently, really,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:90%
that she had these abilities.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But she came from
the Jewish faith.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:84%
My father, of course,
from the Catholic faith.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So they were on
different sides there.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And the way that they saw me
growing up and things like that

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:90%
was very different.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But over time, she
really nurtured

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%
everything that had to
do with spiritual world,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:90%
so that helped me.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's go
back to music for a second.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:84%
You started playing
music when you were what?

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Around nine years old, and
you were shortly performing.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
whole phenomena of music

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:84%
coming from other
realms and prodigies.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, when
it comes down to it,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
when you're speaking about
music coming from other realms

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.636 align:middle line:90%
as far as influence?

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:16.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
whoever's playing it

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:90%
that's not physically present.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Oh, OK.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.981 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:18.812 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's really
what it came down to.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:90%
That was the amazing thing.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'd never heard or
experienced anything like that.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And the music that we'd heard
that night coming through

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:84%
was played on a piano that my
great grandmother had actually

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:90%
given to us.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:90%
It was willed down.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And my mother really had a
sense of peace from that,

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't quite
understand why.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until years
later I was actually

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:90%
composing some music.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't played
piano very often,

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
but I'd written a piece
that I called Goodbye.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And she stumbled into the
room, and looked at me

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:90%
with a very strange look.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's going on?

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
She goes, you realize what
you're playing, don't you?

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And she said that's the song
that we all heard that night.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.910 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
playing that song.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And I realized at that point
that it was the song that I'd

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:90%
heard so many years before.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.759 align:middle line:84%
So it had come to
me spiritually.

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do
you feel it's almost

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:84%
like a channeling of some
kind that's occurring?

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Someone's playing through you?

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.836 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was that the
same with the development

00:08:12.836 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of the rest of your
musical abilities?

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: It definitely was.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.205 align:middle line:84%
Something that I
found very interesting

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
was I didn't want
to take any lessons.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to
just do it on my own.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So I started playing on my
own, and writing on my own,

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and doing all sorts
of different things.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I would write music,
it would literally just

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:90%
come into my head.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And when I would take
it back to my band,

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I would just sit down
and play the music,

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and say, yeah, that's
what I was thinking about.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.983 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, you haven't
worked on this at all?

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, I
developed it in my head.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
that's impossible.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:90%
You just can't do that.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I definitely feel
there was a channel there.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have no
idea who the beings might be?

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: No idea about that,
and I've never questioned it.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.751 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take the leap
then, and maybe flesh out what

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:90%
you did in your musical career.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.475 align:middle line:84%
You were performing,
again, by the age of what?

00:09:00.475 --> 00:09:01.369 align:middle line:90%
12, 13 years old?

00:09:01.369 --> 00:09:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.784 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
happened from there,

00:09:03.784 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and then let's segue
into the recordings

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.130 align:middle line:90%
of disincarnate voices.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.989 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: OK, I'll try
to put it all together.

00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, take your time.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Basically, I started
playing at a very early age,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and I was still living
in that same house

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
where I'd had my
first experience.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And I had tried to convince
myself that these things were

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:90%
just overactive imagination.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was very focused,
and by age 16,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:84%
we had moved into a new
house in Highlands Ranch,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
about five miles from
that original location.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And we moved into the
house, and I actually

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:90%
moved into a basement apartment.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was thrilled,
because I'd have privacy,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.745 align:middle line:84%
and I could write,
and play, and do

00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of different things.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And the first night that we
moved into this new house,

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I actually had more paranormal
experiences that night

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
than I had in my life
prior to that point.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh really?

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
What kind of activity
was going on there?

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: It was
absolutely frightening.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget it.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I had plugged in a
guitar, and I was playing.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'd looked across
the room, and there

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:90%
was two lights that were on.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was a mist that
just rolled into the room.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And I kept checking
my eyes, and blinking,

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed this is
definitely something here.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But I was convinced there was
probably a natural explanation.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So I turned off the
lights, went to sleep.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And I had a cat who was with me
since I was very, very young.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:90%
His name was Licorice.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And he used to sleep on
the pillow on top my head.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And he always spent
every night with me.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, this night,
I shut off lights,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:90%
and he was on top of my head.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I start hearing whispering
outside of the door.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.222 align:middle line:84%
And it was very clear, people
talking back and forth.

00:10:25.222 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:90%
But there was no one outside.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:90%
There was no one upstairs.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And the cat sensed
something was wrong,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and actually crawled underneath
a small space in the door,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
just to get out
of that location.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I actually was able to see
visual light orbs moving

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.404 align:middle line:84%
through the room, and I knew
that there was definitely

00:10:42.404 --> 00:10:44.070 align:middle line:84%
something happening
there at that point.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, it's
not just that old house.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's following me.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first knowledge
that it wasn't necessarily

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:90%
the location, but the person.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do you have recall
of specific types of entities

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying to
get your attention,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and why they wanted
your attention?

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And did they start
speaking to you?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: In that house, I'd
had so many experiences.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.975 align:middle line:84%
I remember there was an older
woman who would come through

00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
on a consistent basis,
and she would actually

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:84%
appear as an apparition in
a mirror on the far wall.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So my band would be
practicing, and all of sudden,

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
you'd hear one instrument
drop out one by one.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.837 align:middle line:90%
And they would just go upstairs.

00:11:21.837 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know exactly
what was going on,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:84%
but then I'd look in the mirror,
and see that she was actually

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:90%
appearing in the mirror.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
they were seeing it?

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: They were
seeing it as well.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was scaring
the bejesus out of them?

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I later found out
that it was a vortex.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:90%
It was a portal.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And the spirits
were coming through.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe that I probably had
a hand in doing that, just

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.867 align:middle line:90%
by being there, just tuning in.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I know it had something
to do with the land,

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
but I believe that I might have
been the vibrational tool that

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.946 align:middle line:90%
came in, and opened things up.

00:11:48.946 --> 00:11:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
determined that they

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.140 align:middle line:90%
were going to talk to me.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you said it
was a mirror on a closet?

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: It was actually on a far
wall in the back of the room.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
it clear as day.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that mirror
or your house was the portal,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:90%
the land was the portal?

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, I think
it was the land.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
It usually turns
out to be the land.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.345 align:middle line:84%
You may look at it,
if it's a ley line,

00:12:11.345 --> 00:12:13.511 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the case might
be, but it was definitely

00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:90%
something to do with the land.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've always found it
interesting in so many fairy

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
tales and even current
representations

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.479 align:middle line:90%
such as the movie.

00:12:22.479 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:90%
What was it called?

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Very recently.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
It was love story, the fellow
that did "Love, Actually."

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And the way
wardrobes and closets

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:84%
are used as the
place of transition

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.490 align:middle line:90%
into other timelines and such.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know Andrea
Peron, right?

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Yes.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in Andrea Peron's
home, again, same thing,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:84%
the wardrobe just rattling and
a being standing around it.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Opening up that
gate, that doorway.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And even though it's
not a physical doorway,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
they usually do choose something
that we can identify with.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
was the nature of some

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:90%
of the communications to you?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Why were they so
desperate to reach you?

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, it's my
belief in my research.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I've found that there
are certain people,

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
some people call
them mediums, where

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
we have a certain
energy that's around us.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And spirits see
that aura energy.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a bright blue.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And they know they we're the
ones who have the ability

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:84%
to hear them, and then relay
information back to their loved

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:90%
ones on this side.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So usually they'll come
through, and go directly to us

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:90%
to communicate.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is it
often because there's

00:13:29.738 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
unfinished business
with someone they care

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:90%
for that's still incarnate?

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: You know, it just
really depends on the situation.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:90%
There are those circumstances.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:84%
We find out with
earthbound spirits

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.086 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit that those
are the ones that

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
want to communicate
with somebody over here

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
to get a message across before
they actually move forward.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
going into electronic voice

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
What was your
transition from being

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
a recording artist to a
different kind of recording

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:90%
artist?

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.941 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a very different kind.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
It all started with me
actually going out and touring.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I would go on the road,
and I would ghost hunt.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.006 align:middle line:84%
I'd do parallel
investigations, and everyone

00:14:12.006 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:84%
thought I was
crazy for doing it,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
but I came back with things, so
that they weren't so skeptical.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.414 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
had a tour manager

00:14:18.414 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that was interested in
the same type of thing.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.038 align:middle line:84%
And the two of us got
into that together,

00:14:22.038 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and we'd go out and investigate
while we were out on tour.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.214 align:middle line:84%
But when I retired, we got
all the evidence together,

00:14:27.214 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and piled it in the
middle of the table,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and said, what we do
with all this stuff?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:84%
This is in the days
before all the TV shows

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:90%
and things that were out there.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:10%
And I decided to put
up a website called

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:10%
ghosthuntermagazine.com.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:10%
We put it up there
thinking nobody

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:10%
would pay any attention,
and all of sudden,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:10%
people from around
the world started

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.534 align:middle line:10%
sending in their stories,
and their pictures,

00:14:43.534 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:10%
and their videos,
and things like that.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And it became a huge sensation.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:84%
They started ghost
hunting under our name.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't quite know what
we'd gotten ourselves into,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.802 align:middle line:84%
but eventually my
friend Jeff decided

00:14:54.802 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and get
married in Las Vegas,

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and I lost my ghost
hunting partner.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my
father, the skeptic,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.205 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Dad, I'm going to
open up a paranormal magazine.

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:06.639 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be print.

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call
it "Haunted Times."

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to go
into business with me?

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.697 align:middle line:84%
And he made the
agreement to go in.

00:15:11.697 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: I know it sounds
crazy, but he went into it

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:90%
to be the skeptic.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going
to finally prove

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:90%
that these things aren't real.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.370 align:middle line:90%
You're crazy.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.245 align:middle line:84%
And I went in to prove
to him that it was.

00:15:22.245 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
actually a good arrangement.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: It really was, because
we balanced each other.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:84%
There was things that
I could show him,

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and things he could
say, wait a minute.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the heating duct.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.028 align:middle line:90%
And I'd go, oh, you're right.

00:15:32.028 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:90%
That that's very, very true.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:90%
So it was a good arrangement.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:84%
But we started that
in 2004 as an online.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.147 align:middle line:84%
In 2005, we put out
the first print issue.

00:15:41.147 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
We became the world's
largest paranormal magazine,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.205 align:middle line:84%
and we're distributed
in every major bookstore

00:15:45.205 --> 00:15:46.134 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:15:46.134 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we were really thrown
into the world of publishing.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Best part about that, we
published through 2012,

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:84%
but the thing that really
was great about that was I

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:84%
had the opportunity
to take my father out

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:90%
on these investigations.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And where he went in very
skeptical and cynical

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of ways, in the end,
he started having experiences,

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:90%
experiences he couldn't explain.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.836 align:middle line:90%
And he tried to look at science.

00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
He tried to look at his
religious background.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.918 align:middle line:84%
He tried to look at reasoning
that these things might

00:16:13.918 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:90%
be happening.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And my greatest confirmation was
he stood up at one of my events

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:84%
fairly recently, and
said, I have to say,

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
my son has completely changed my
point of view on the afterlife.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I see everything
completely differently now,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:90%
and I thank him for that.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And that was my life
goal at that point.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.555 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, what do I do now?

00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I proved to
him it was all real.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
did that do to him

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
in terms of his
internal relationship

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to his religion and
then this phenomena?

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Did it create some kind
of incongruity within him?

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: It's very interesting
to watch this happen.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I'll circle back around
to that question.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:84%
We hold events we call Ghost
Hunter University since 2003,

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
where we would take the
public into haunted locations,

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and we would actually
teach a class

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
on how to become
an investigator,

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.599 align:middle line:84%
and then take them on an
investigation of that property

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:84%
with all the equipment,
including the spirit phone,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:90%
and let them have experiences.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:84%
And you get believers
who come in,

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.525 align:middle line:84%
and every noise and bang
is something paranormal,

00:17:16.525 --> 00:17:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
explain it's not.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that was
really fascinating, and still

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:84%
is to me to this day,
is to watch somebody

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.430 align:middle line:84%
who's very cynical,
and very skeptical,

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:90%
and they're inside their box.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And once they have
an experience,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:84%
it shatters that box
completely, because there's

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:36.240 align:middle line:84%
no logical explanation
for what's happened.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And you see a complete
change in that person

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:90%
almost instantaneously.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.359 align:middle line:84%
And it's just fascinating
to see that happen,

00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:84%
because they're the first
person to criticize you

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:90%
when they come in the room.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.270 align:middle line:84%
They're the last person
to leave that night,

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and then they want your email
address, your phone number,

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and they want to make
sure they stay in contact.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So my father was much
that way, but it was

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:90%
a much slower process for him.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he heard the
piano playing, didn't he?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: He did hear
the piano playing.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what did
he lay that off to?

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: He always had an excuse.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.600 align:middle line:90%
He always had a reason.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Basically, he said it had
to be a radio outside.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Someone's playing,
and we just decided

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.510 align:middle line:90%
not to get up and hear it.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.635 align:middle line:84%
Later, he admitted that he
couldn't get himself out

00:18:11.635 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:90%
of bed.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.470 align:middle line:84%
But his mind, that
very skeptical mind,

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:84%
had just told him,
leave it alone.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.152 align:middle line:84%
He'd witnessed a box moving
across the floor on its own

00:18:21.152 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:90%
while I was very young.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he
wouldn't tell you this.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, no, he was
with me when it happened.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.656 align:middle line:84%
And he still looked at me,
and walked up the stairs.

00:18:27.656 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Would never talk about it again.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So it took many years for
him to even go back, and go,

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:90%
I do remember that, yeah.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:90%
I do remember that happening.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now when
the music was playing

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.756 align:middle line:84%
and you said he
couldn't get out of bed,

00:18:36.756 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:84%
does that mean he literally
could not get out of bed?

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:39.920 align:middle line:90%
Or?

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.367 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, when we all
talked about the experience,

00:18:42.367 --> 00:18:44.325 align:middle line:84%
because of course, my
parents were in one room,

00:18:44.325 --> 00:18:46.283 align:middle line:84%
I was in the other, and
we had several animals.

00:18:46.283 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
We had two dogs and
a cat at the time.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And we had a German Shepherd
that if he heard a noise,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:90%
he was up and doing something.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But all of us recounted
the next morning

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.944 align:middle line:84%
that it felt like we had
a weight on our chest.

00:18:56.944 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And when we would try
to lift ourselves,

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:90%
we just could not move.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:84%
The animals lifted their
heads, but never moved off

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.970 align:middle line:90%
of their bed.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So it tells me that
we were all supposed

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to experience that,
and recount it,

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and then come back
to it much later.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so how did
you end up recording?

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's make that leap
now, from investigating

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:90%
to recording.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.044 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, when we
do the investigations,

00:19:21.044 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:84%
we would go out, and we would
take tape recorders with us,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.120 align:middle line:84%
hoping that we might
capture something.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And we had Polaroid cameras,
very, very dated today.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand what
these things might be.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And we captured some very
interesting things on those,

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:90%
but they were inconclusive.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So we really wanted to
speak to the spirits.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:90%
That was my goal.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find out
why are you here,

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and what takes place
in the next world?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted to find
out where do we go after this,

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and what does this lifetime
mean to us in the next world?

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So I came up with the idea
after many different things.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:84%
We tried all sorts
of terrible things.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:84%
We tried Ouija boards, and now
we know how horrible that is.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But we were doing
anything we could.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So I remember we got a
Radio Shack tape recorder,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.649 align:middle line:84%
and decided the
best way was to see

00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:08.190 align:middle line:84%
if spirits would
speak to us while we

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.786 align:middle line:90%
were on our investigations.

00:20:09.786 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
The thing I realized
very quickly

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.535 align:middle line:84%
is that we would have these
tapes running the entire time

00:20:13.535 --> 00:20:14.530 align:middle line:90%
that we were out there.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.988 align:middle line:84%
And you might hear something,
but you were never quite sure

00:20:16.988 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:90%
what it was.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So one day, and I believe
that this was definitely

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.635 align:middle line:84%
spiritual inspiration, a light
hit me, and I went, you know,

00:20:25.635 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:84%
it only makes sense that if
you want to speak to someone,

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
the best way to do it
is to sit down and have

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.310 align:middle line:90%
an interview with them.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought if spirits
have this energy,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle line:84%
they should be able to imprint
their energy on a recording.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.424 align:middle line:84%
And that's the logic
that I had at the point.

00:20:38.424 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I
came up with an idea.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.964 align:middle line:84%
I said, let's all
sit in a group.

00:20:42.964 --> 00:20:44.505 align:middle line:84%
We'll turn on the
recorder, I'm going

00:20:44.505 --> 00:20:48.467 align:middle line:84%
to announce who we are, what
we're doing, why we're here.

00:20:48.467 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Let the spirits know that
we're here with respect.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to
disrespect them.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:84%
To let them know
that we just want

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
to learn about who they are
now, and who they were then.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And then at that point,
start asking questions.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So the process that I would come
up with was my introduction.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd say my first
question is, please speak

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:90%
directly into this red light.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:84%
My first question is,
what is your name?

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we would leave
10 seconds of silence.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the next person
would ask their question,

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:90%
and so on, and so forth.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.111 align:middle line:84%
And we had 10 seconds
in between these things.

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And if we heard a noise, a
natural one, a dog barking,

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
a car driving by, we'd say,
note, dog barking, note, car,

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
note this-- to let us know
that they were false positives.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
we would do is we

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.940 align:middle line:84%
would tell the spirits to speak
directly into the red light,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and then we would
start asking questions.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.422 align:middle line:84%
So we'd leave the
10 second spaces,

00:21:34.422 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and if we heard
any natural noises,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.921 align:middle line:84%
we would mention those
natural noises, so that we

00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:39.447 align:middle line:90%
knew what we were recording.

00:21:39.447 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And after we would
finish the session,

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
We'd thank the spirits
for letting us be there.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And we would go back, and
listen to these recordings that

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:84%
would come through, and we were
just absolutely blown away,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:84%
when we were here actual spirit
voices being recorded answering

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:90%
our questions directly.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And it really gave
me the platform

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
to become a pioneer
in EVP and ITC.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, I listened
to I think all of them

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:90%
on your site.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a link there
where you can click

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:90%
on the recordings themselves.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are so clear it's

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.679 align:middle line:84%
as though they're literally in
the room with you physically.

00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some I can't
understand as well.

00:22:17.219 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:90%
You can, but I can't.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:90%
But some are just crystal clear.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to play
a few of those later on.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: That'd be great.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I want to get into
some of the history of it,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
because I was surprised to
learn that Thomas Jefferson had

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:84%
his spirit-- I mean, not Thomas
Jefferson, Thomas Edison.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Not Jefferson.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: You surprised
me for a second.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
surprised me too.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Edison had
his spirit box.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:84%
He had created the spirit
box before he died.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the
history of this technology,

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
starting with Thomas
Edison, and then

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:84%
through to some of the
people that discredited

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:90%
the whole-- what is his name?

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.740 align:middle line:84%
William O'Neil and his
ventriloquist friend,

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:90%
who discredited all of this.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.325 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:22:56.325 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, the original idea was
we were doing these open air

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:84%
recordings, where we just
had our recorders out,

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
asking spirits to speak
directly into them.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And we got a lot of
great types of recordings

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:90%
that came through.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But in 2002, I was
actually contacted

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:84%
by a man named Frank
Sumption, and we

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:84%
started having an
email exchange,

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.750 align:middle line:90%
where it wasn't pleasant.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Basically, he said that I
needed to get out of the field,

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know
what I was doing.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote him back.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And this went on for months,
and months, and months.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Frank, I'm gonna
go ahead, and let this go.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote me
back one last email,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
because that was
just how Frank was.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you may wonder
why I'm such an expert in EVP.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I've actually completed Thomas
Edison's telephone to the dead.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And I laughed at this point,
because it was a legend.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:84%
The one thing we did know is
that Edison, yes, in fact,

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.362 align:middle line:84%
was working on this machine
before he passed away,

00:23:46.362 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:84%
which sounds crazy if
you think about it.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.486 align:middle line:84%
The scientific
mind, the inventor,

00:23:49.486 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
why would he be working
on this machine?

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is his
mother was a spiritualist,

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and he was actually
very close with her.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So when she died, he started
to reexamine his views

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.569 align:middle line:90%
on the afterlife.

00:23:59.569 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And he decided that if
energy could neither

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
be created or destroyed,
it could only change form,

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.159 align:middle line:84%
we being energy, it
had to go somewhere.

00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So he started working
on the machine,

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about his work
in "Scientific American."

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:84%
He talked about his
work in "Forbes."

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.732 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On the spirit?

00:24:12.732 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: On this machine
that he was working on.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.446 align:middle line:84%
And his contemporaries
absolutely lost their minds.

00:24:17.446 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:84%
They did not want him
talking about this, because--

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no
wonder we know nothing.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:84%
That's a missing
piece of his history.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:90%
And that was the thing.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want him
to be discredited

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.379 align:middle line:84%
for all of his great
work because he

00:24:27.379 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:90%
had lost his mind at the end.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So when he did
pass, the thing was,

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:90%
they never did find a machine.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And when they went back
and looked at his archives,

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and they looked at his
meticulous journals

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:84%
that he kept on
everything that he did,

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.490 align:middle line:90%
those pages were torn out.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So this was not
meant to be for them.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting thing
is that Edison apparently

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:84%
had come through to several
mediums through the years,

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and was trying to tell them
how to complete the machine.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.730 align:middle line:84%
But no one
understood, and no one

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.240 align:middle line:90%
had physical ability to do it.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So there was an early
attempt called Spiricom.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:25:02.665 --> 00:25:04.691 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: And he was
one of the scientists

00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
on the other side who was
coming through an attempting

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:90%
to work on Spiricom.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.387 align:middle line:84%
But as we all know,
that project fell apart,

00:25:10.387 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
because the living
scientists believed

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
they were smarter than the
scientists who'd passed,

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:90%
and the whole project blew up.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So we really didn't think that
this was anything legitimate.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So when Frank
contacted me and said,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I've completed Thomas Edison's
telephone to the dead,

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.129 align:middle line:90%
I really was entertained.

00:25:25.129 --> 00:25:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
that relationship--

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.755 align:middle line:90%
how did that happen?

00:25:27.755 --> 00:25:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, I'm
going to get to that,

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.603 align:middle line:84%
because this is the craziest
story you'll ever hear.

00:25:31.603 --> 00:25:32.086 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:32.086 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:90%
I've heard a lot of crazy ones.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.730 align:middle line:90%
That'll be good.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: This one is interesting.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.772 align:middle line:10%
He actually told me.

00:25:36.772 --> 00:25:37.980 align:middle line:10%
He said, I've completed this.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:10%
So I laughed about it.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:10%
And I wrote him
back one last email,

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.970 align:middle line:10%
and I said, Frank, I
will fly to any location

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:10%
that you are in the world to
see this thing work one time,

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:10%
expecting never to hear back.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.674 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that he was 15
minutes from my office.

00:25:49.674 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh no.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: He lived right
up the road from me.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.652 align:middle line:84%
So the two of us had fought
back and forth for so long--

00:25:55.652 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You could have had
coffee and worked it out.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly, exactly.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.997 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to set
up a formal meeting.

00:25:59.997 --> 00:26:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the only place
to set up a formal meeting

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:03.955 align:middle line:84%
is the International
House of Pancakes.

00:26:03.955 --> 00:26:04.947 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:26:04.947 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: So my father
and I got the suits on.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
We got the briefcases
together, and we showed up

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.390 align:middle line:90%
at the international.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:90%
House of Pancakes.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And Frank was there
with a trucker's hat on,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:90%
and a flannel shirt.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And he panicked
when we showed up.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And once he was
convinced that we weren't

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
CIA or FBI or any kind of
strange government agency,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:84%
he decided he could tell us the
story of how this came to be.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The most fascinating story I've
ever heard in my entire life.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:27.181 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh right.

00:26:27.181 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Do tell.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: So you have to
picture the scene, my father

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and I really
looking at this guy,

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:84%
thinking is this
really legitimate?

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And him, on other
side of the booth,

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and we're sitting there
talking back and forth.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.596 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
that Frank apparently

00:26:39.596 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
was a short wave radio buff
and electronics engineer.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
He liked to build
things at home.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And he was reading a
1995 "Popular Science"

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.020 align:middle line:84%
magazine article about the
voices of the dead coming

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
through short wave
radio experimentation.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So he set up the
experiment the way

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that they'd said to set
it up, just to debunk it,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.241 align:middle line:84%
so that he could write
into the magazine and say,

00:26:59.241 --> 00:27:00.670 align:middle line:90%
this is why you're wrong.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, he built the
machine the way they said to,

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.770 align:middle line:84%
flipped the thing
on, and it called him

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.040 align:middle line:84%
by his first, middle,
and last name right

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:90%
when he turned it on.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
He shuts it off, walks
away for six months,

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.116 align:middle line:90%
thinking he had lost his mind.

00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:15.615 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if it was curiosity

00:27:15.615 --> 00:27:17.670 align:middle line:84%
that got the best of him, or
whatever the case might be.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.169 align:middle line:84%
But he finally came back to the
project, flipped it back on,

00:27:20.169 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and now it wasn't just
calling by his name,

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.110 align:middle line:84%
it was telling him how to
complete Thomas Edison's

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:84%
telephone to the dead-- circuit
boards, diodes, schematics,

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.430 align:middle line:84%
everything he could
possibly want to do.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Frank, being an
extremely eccentric man,

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:84%
decided to listen to the voices
that were coming through,

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and build it to
their specifications.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So he built this machine
the way that they

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.349 align:middle line:84%
said to at that point, flipped
it on for the first time,

00:27:41.349 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:84%
thinking it's not
even going to work.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.370 align:middle line:84%
The voices are
clearer than before,

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:84%
telling him how to build a
better version of that device.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.009 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to
picture my father

00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and I sitting across the
booth from this man telling us

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.010 align:middle line:90%
this story.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're kicking each other
underneath the table trying

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.560 align:middle line:90%
not to laugh.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yet, you're connected.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:90%
You hear things.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.134 align:middle line:90%
I mean, but why would--

00:27:59.134 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: But this
is a crazy story.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: So I turn to him.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.200 align:middle line:10%
I said, Frank, is there
any way that we can

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.550 align:middle line:10%
see this thing work sometime?

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:10%
He said, absolutely.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.490 align:middle line:10%
Come down to my
workshop next weekend.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I'll show it to you.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.447 align:middle line:84%
So the next weekend
came, and we went

00:28:11.447 --> 00:28:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to his workshop, which
of course, as located

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.676 align:middle line:90%
in this house, in his basement.

00:28:15.676 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And we got to his
house, and we started

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:90%
walking down these stairs.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
describe this place

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
was like a cross between
a bad 1960s sci-fi

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
movie and "Deliverance,"
somewhere right

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:90%
between those two.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:84%
It was speakers hanging
from the walls, wires

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
hanging from the walls,
crossbows, pelts.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And as we walked into the
main part of the room,

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:84%
There was a gigantic
tin foil pyramid hanging

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the ceiling.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to my
father, and I said,

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.172 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
make it out alive.

00:28:43.172 --> 00:28:44.005 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:28:44.005 --> 00:28:44.867 align:middle line:90%
We walked in.

00:28:44.867 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And I remember looking
over to my left

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.991 align:middle line:84%
as we walked into
the room, and there

00:28:47.991 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:84%
was a gigantic 1980s computer
tower, one of those huge manila

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.056 align:middle line:90%
computer towers.

00:28:52.056 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like somebody
had ripped the face plate off

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:84%
of it, shoved in
a bunch of wiring,

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.300 align:middle line:84%
and made a face plate
that didn't quite fit,

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:90%
and screwed it on.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And I looked over at
it, and I said, oh,

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:90%
please tell me that's not it.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And about that time,
Frank walks over.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:90%
He goes, this is it!

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.371 align:middle line:90%
I went, oh.

00:29:07.371 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So he goes, do you want
to hear this thing work?

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.490 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So he flips this huge silver
switch on the front of it,

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:90%
and it makes a warm up sounds.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.090 align:middle line:90%
It's like wum-wum-wum-wum.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little wood
speaker sitting up on top.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded like someone
taking one of those old time

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.687 align:middle line:84%
radio dials, and turning
it back, and forth,

00:29:25.687 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:90%
and back, and forth.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.811 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With a lot of static.

00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Static and noise.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
at it, and I think

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:90%
this man's built a broken radio.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.500 align:middle line:84%
He thinks he's talking to
ghosts and aliens through it.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.109 align:middle line:90%
It's probably time for us to go.

00:29:39.109 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:90%
So I looked at my father.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:40.680 align:middle line:90%
He looked at me.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Frank, thank you
so much for having us out here.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:90%
This is just such a great thing.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:84%
We'll try to do something
about on this in the magazine.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you again.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And we started walking
out of the room.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, wait!

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh no.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, the
voices said you're

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.068 align:middle line:90%
supposed to take this with you.

00:29:56.068 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, the voices?

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, Frank.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.627 align:middle line:84%
Well, how much do I owe you
for something like this?

00:30:02.627 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, no, no.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't get it, do you?

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.950 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're
supposed to take this out,

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.350 align:middle line:90%
and talk to ghosts.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to stay here
and build these things.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.329 align:middle line:90%
So panic ensues at this point.

00:30:14.329 --> 00:30:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Banjos start playing.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.094 align:middle line:90%
My father grabs one half of it.

00:30:18.094 --> 00:30:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I grab the other half.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:90%
We get outside.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We're driving a
jeep at the time.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember we didn't
set this machine in.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We threw it into the back of
the jeep, slammed the door,

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.181 align:middle line:84%
and started driving away
as fast as we possibly can.

00:30:28.181 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And as we're driving away, we're
having the near death talk.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
ever had one of those

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:84%
before, where, oh, did
you see the [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.350 align:middle line:84%
we're going back and
forth about that.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.725 align:middle line:84%
And I started
thinking to myself,

00:30:36.725 --> 00:30:39.320 align:middle line:84%
this guy is kind of
an electronics genius.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:84%
What if he didn't build a
telephone to the dead at all?

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.246 align:middle line:84%
And I think back
to our big fight.

00:30:43.246 --> 00:30:45.201 align:middle line:84%
I think, what if he
built, like, a dirty bomb?

00:30:45.201 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're driving away, and
he's got a remote control,

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.650 align:middle line:90%
and you know, we blow up?

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.950 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't blow.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.905 align:middle line:84%
And we took it
back to the office,

00:30:52.905 --> 00:30:55.659 align:middle line:84%
and it actually sat on
the shelf for a year.

00:30:55.659 --> 00:30:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he call
you during that time?

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.491 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: He tried to get
a hold of me a few times,

00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:00.467 align:middle line:90%
and I just ignored him.

00:31:00.467 --> 00:31:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I really did, because I thought
this man's going to find

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.841 align:middle line:90%
this us and hunt us down.

00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:05.467 align:middle line:90%
I was actually scared.

00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So it sat there, and we'd
walk by it each morning.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:84%
We'd laugh a little
bit as we'd walk in.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.426 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A pelt with
golden hair on his wall.

00:31:11.426 --> 00:31:12.266 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:14.240 align:middle line:84%
That's when we're thinking
that's what we need.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.230 align:middle line:90%
So it did.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.780 align:middle line:84%
It sat there for
a good solid year.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.316 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
holidays come up.

00:31:18.316 --> 00:31:20.440 align:middle line:84%
We're getting ready to shut
down the office for it,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.148 align:middle line:84%
and we had a huge
investigation coming up

00:31:22.148 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:84%
at the Sallie House
in Atchison, Kansas,

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.300 align:middle line:90%
that was right behind that.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.620 align:middle line:90%
And I walked into the office.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:90%
I saw the thing sitting there.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going to prove to
Frank this thing doesn't work.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:90%
So I got--

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone's
trying to prove to everyone

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.060 align:middle line:90%
that it doesn't work.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, this doesn't work.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's great.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: So I turn
the thing on, I

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.420 align:middle line:84%
leave the recorder
there all day,

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.320 align:middle line:84%
went back at the end of
the day, got the recorder.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.153 align:middle line:84%
Plugged into software
at the end of the day,

00:31:41.153 --> 00:31:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and put on the big 1970s
Princess Leia headphones,

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and I started listening to
the recording as it's going.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.144 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
a broken radio.

00:31:48.144 --> 00:31:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm sitting there
listening to this recording,

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.601 align:middle line:84%
I start thinking about the
case that we have coming up.

00:31:52.601 --> 00:31:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I think about the spirits,
the names, all the dates,

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:56.290 align:middle line:90%
the different things like that.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And I realize I still have
the sound going in my ears.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.967 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go
and shut this off.

00:32:00.967 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So I went to hit the stop
button on the recording.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I went to hit the
stop button, clear as day,

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:90%
it said your trip to Atchison.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.406 align:middle line:90%
And I hit stop.

00:32:09.406 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sitting in Denver,
Colorado at this point.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Pretty big city.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Atchison, Kansas,
speck on the map.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, what
are the chances of a radio

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.990 align:middle line:84%
fragment coming through
saying, your trip to Atchison,

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.144 align:middle line:84%
when I was going to be
going there in three days.

00:32:22.144 --> 00:32:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So I rewound it, and I
listened three or four times,

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and it said, your
trip to Atchison.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.038 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, hmm, I'm going
to turn this over to one

00:32:28.038 --> 00:32:29.348 align:middle line:90%
of my best EVP people.

00:32:29.348 --> 00:32:30.473 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say a word to him.

00:32:30.473 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I said, just listen and
see if you get anything.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.080 align:middle line:84%
They found more facts
in this that only

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.500 align:middle line:84%
my team knew than I'd even
heard come through this.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.965 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it clearer than
the little Radio Shack tape

00:32:40.965 --> 00:32:41.715 align:middle line:90%
recordings you'd--

00:32:41.715 --> 00:32:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Much clearer,
much clearer.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.430 align:middle line:90%
And it was very distinct voices.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.930 align:middle line:84%
If one spirit would
speak, you would

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.890 align:middle line:84%
hear that exact
voice that would come

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.210 align:middle line:90%
through each and every time.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:51.840 align:middle line:90%
So it really blew us away.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So long story short, we
decided to take this thing out

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.240 align:middle line:90%
to Atchison, Kansas.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.774 align:middle line:84%
And we put the
machine in the back,

00:32:57.774 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and we're driving out there.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:84%
It was me, my mother,
and my father.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.879 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well let's
go ahead and come up

00:33:02.879 --> 00:33:04.920 align:middle line:84%
with a plan on how we're
going to use this thing.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it
doesn't even work.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.808 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
think it does either,

00:33:07.808 --> 00:33:09.914 align:middle line:84%
but let's figure out how
we're going to do this.

00:33:09.914 --> 00:33:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So the plan we
came up with was we

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.340 align:middle line:84%
would take the machine during
the day into the house,

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.881 align:middle line:84%
into the most active room in
the house, which is the nursery.

00:33:15.881 --> 00:33:17.820 align:middle line:84%
We would plug it in,
turn it on leave,

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and then bring the whole
team back that night,

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and see if anything was
happening, if we could actually

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.480 align:middle line:90%
hear anything coming through.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So we got there, and
it was actually dusk.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:84%
If anybody knows anything
about Sallie House

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:29.310 align:middle line:84%
knows it's one of the most
active houses in the United

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.880 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we talked
with Michael Esposito.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I think he and some
others went there as well.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.612 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lots of
investigators go there.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.946 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: It is such
an incredible place.

00:33:37.946 --> 00:33:39.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
like it's pretty

00:33:39.445 --> 00:33:40.560 align:middle line:90%
horrific in a lot of ways.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: It's just
absolutely amazing,

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:90%
the activity that's there.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And this was really back in
the early, like, 2002 era,

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.100 align:middle line:84%
before a lot of
investigators had gone in,

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.620 align:middle line:84%
so we were fresh into
the evidence there.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.660 align:middle line:90%
And that was the thing.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.730 align:middle line:84%
We just knew, don't go in this
house without a huge team.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:59.826 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:33:59.826 --> 00:34:00.950 align:middle line:90%
So it was me and my father.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.040 align:middle line:90%
We took the machine in.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.539 align:middle line:84%
My mother would not
go in the house.

00:34:03.539 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:90%
She said, you guys, good luck.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And we took it upstairs, we
plugged in, turned it on,

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and the machine started making
the broken radio sounds.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.777 align:middle line:84%
And I probably had the
idiot moment of my life.

00:34:13.777 --> 00:34:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I was standing in front
of it, my skeptical father

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.790 align:middle line:84%
standing next to me,
and I started rambling.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.485 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if there's any
ghosts here who want to talk,

00:34:21.485 --> 00:34:23.610 align:middle line:84%
please speak through this
machine that Frank built.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.693 align:middle line:90%
I've already heard things.

00:34:24.693 --> 00:34:25.400 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Going on and on.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:84%
And then an odd
thing came to me,

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:30.440 align:middle line:90%
and I said, technicians assist.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.389 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.889 align:middle line:84%
I looked at him, and we started
walking down the stairs.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:90%
We got two or three steps down.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.050 align:middle line:90%
Someone turned this thing to 10.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.830 align:middle line:84%
It was just cranked
to the very top level.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:90%
And you hear that-- shhh!

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.011 align:middle line:90%
White noise comes through.

00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:44.469 align:middle line:84%
And we both froze
at the same time.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:45.719 align:middle line:90%
So he heard it.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.739 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like we
stood there for hours.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.449 align:middle line:84%
It was probably a
matter of seconds.

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:50.907 align:middle line:84%
But the most amazing
thing about it

00:34:50.907 --> 00:34:53.320 align:middle line:84%
was we hear a male voice
come through the speaker,

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.600 align:middle line:90%
and it says Sallie, listen.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, every
hair on my buddy shot up,

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:90%
and I keeled over.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And my father kind of
does one of these things.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And still to this day,
the most amazing thing

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.135 align:middle line:84%
I've ever heard
in my entire life,

00:35:08.135 --> 00:35:11.340 align:middle line:84%
this little girl's voice that
we captured on open air EVP

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:15.520 align:middle line:84%
dozens of times comes through
the speakers of this machine.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.930 align:middle line:84%
This male entity was
actually training her

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.515 align:middle line:84%
how to use the machine,
and speak back and forth.

00:35:20.515 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:84%
We stood there till it was
pitch black inside that house,

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:84%
listening to this conversation,
going back and forth.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Finally got outside, pulled
all the equipment in.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Pointed it directly
at this machine,

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and I started asking
questions into the open air,

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and realized, as I
was asking questions,

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.767 align:middle line:84%
spirits were actually answering
the questions in real time,

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:39.100 align:middle line:84%
in their own voices, giving
us information that we could

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.990 align:middle line:90%
have never known about before.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:42.660 align:middle line:84%
We were getting
names, dates, things

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.284 align:middle line:84%
that had happened at
times in the house

00:35:44.284 --> 00:35:45.962 align:middle line:90%
that we had no idea about.

00:35:45.962 --> 00:35:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to tell
the world about this.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.253 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was most incredible
thing that had ever happened.

00:35:50.253 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize
how crazy I sounded.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So I got a radio show the
next day, a live radio remote,

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to tell one
of my good friends about this.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
he hung up on me,

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.030 align:middle line:84%
because he thought
I'd lost my mind.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And really, what it came
down to was the fact

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people were
still coming to my Ghost Hunter

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.380 align:middle line:90%
University events.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.180 align:middle line:84%
They would witness
the machine working,

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and they would actually able
to speak to the spirits there,

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and of course, it was just
a mindblowing experience

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.219 align:middle line:90%
when these things happened.

00:36:17.219 --> 00:36:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that would
happen each and every time

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:84%
is that one of our
attendee's relatives

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.465 align:middle line:84%
would come through
in her own voice.

00:36:23.465 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to ask that, yeah.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: And I feel
terrible about it today,

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.112 align:middle line:84%
but when they would
ask a question,

00:36:28.112 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:84%
they would be talking to
the spirits in the location,

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, you're
hear a woman's voice go, Tommy?

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And someone would go,
that was my grandma.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.220 align:middle line:90%
That's my grandma's voice.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'd turn to him, and I'd
say, that's not why we're here.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.550 align:middle line:84%
We'd go back to it, because my
intent wasn't to communicate

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.410 align:middle line:90%
with these people's relatives.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:47.014 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find out what had
happened in these locations.

00:36:47.014 --> 00:36:48.930 align:middle line:84%
We were in places like
the Lizzy Borden house.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.846 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, he must
have been so devastated.

00:36:50.846 --> 00:36:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: These people hate me.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:90%
What a terrible human being.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.765 align:middle line:90%
I was just so focused on this.

00:36:55.765 --> 00:36:57.890 align:middle line:10%
And the one thing that I
was really fortunate about

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:10%
is that Chip Coffey
and I were friends.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.190 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people know Chip.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.630 align:middle line:10%
He does psychic kids,
a lot of TV shows now.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.524 align:middle line:10%
But these are the days
before the TV shows.

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:10%
And he would get so angry
with me, because he'd say,

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.190 align:middle line:10%
you know, you're
a medium, and it's

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.960 align:middle line:10%
your job to do these
readings for people.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Chip,
that's not what I do.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I just try to go in
and find out what

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:84%
happened in these locations, and
find out where we go from here.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, you
really need to help people.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.695 align:middle line:84%
So he basically suckered me
into doing a conference out

00:37:23.695 --> 00:37:24.996 align:middle line:90%
in Savannah, Georgia.

00:37:24.996 --> 00:37:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
spookiest cities.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: It in one of the
most haunted restaurants

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:30.322 align:middle line:90%
that there was.

00:37:30.322 --> 00:37:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And he brought me in
for this conference,

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I was
just going to be talking

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.375 align:middle line:84%
about the machine,
but what he did

00:37:34.375 --> 00:37:35.958 align:middle line:84%
is, he brought in a
live radio remote.

00:37:35.958 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:90%
He brought in PA system.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And he had five people
lined up against the wall

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.782 align:middle line:90%
and a microphone.

00:37:40.782 --> 00:37:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he said,
you're going to get up there,

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to do
readings for these five people,

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to like it.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.540 align:middle line:90%
And I said OK, Chip.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Because you just
do that with Chip.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:50.145 align:middle line:84%
And I turned on
the machine, and it

00:37:50.145 --> 00:37:51.520 align:middle line:84%
was coming through
the PA system,

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.055 align:middle line:84%
and my voice was
coming through the PA.

00:37:53.055 --> 00:37:55.471 align:middle line:84%
And this very large southern
man got up to the microphone.

00:37:55.471 --> 00:37:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh boy,
this can't go well.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And he got up
there, and he said,

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.712 align:middle line:84%
yeah, my grandma had a name
that she used to call me,

00:38:02.712 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and there's no way you'd ever
know what that name would be.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And before I could open my
mouth, through the machine,

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.560 align:middle line:84%
his grandmother comes through,
calls him by the nickname.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.920 align:middle line:90%
He falls to his knees crying.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.332 align:middle line:90%
They drag him off at that point.

00:38:13.332 --> 00:38:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking to
myself, is this good?

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This sounds
like a tent revival.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.586 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:38:16.586 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, is this what's
supposed to happen?

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.244 align:middle line:84%
So those five people
came up, and they

00:38:20.244 --> 00:38:22.160 align:middle line:84%
were able to communicate
with their loved ones

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.674 align:middle line:84%
in their own voice, and
get a lot of confirmation.

00:38:24.674 --> 00:38:26.090 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the
conference decided

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:90%
they all wanted to do it too.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.961 align:middle line:84%
Every single person who was
at the conference that day

00:38:29.961 --> 00:38:31.793 align:middle line:84%
was able to communicate
with their loved one

00:38:31.793 --> 00:38:32.590 align:middle line:90%
in their own voice.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was absolutely
blown away by this,

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.350 align:middle line:84%
but I was really drained after
it was all said and done.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So chip came up to me
afterwards, and he said,

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.310 align:middle line:84%
are you ready to start
doing those readings now?

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:42.850 align:middle line:90%
And I said, absolutely not.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But I actually had
experiences after that,

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.970 align:middle line:84%
where I did a reading
at the Stanley Hotel.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:51.972 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned,
my technicians,

00:38:51.972 --> 00:38:54.430 align:middle line:84%
which I call my spirit guides,
the people on the other side

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.600 align:middle line:84%
who I work with to
make sure that we're

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.600 align:middle line:84%
dealing with the spirits
that we're supposed to,

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.110 align:middle line:84%
the ones that keep
us out of danger,

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.337 align:middle line:84%
that are over there,
one of them actually

00:39:02.337 --> 00:39:04.170 align:middle line:84%
introduced me to their
living parents, which

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:05.880 align:middle line:90%
was just absolutely incredible.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So they brought us together,
and it was just a mindblowing

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.690 align:middle line:90%
journey that we'd had together.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, I knew
it was time to start

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.230 align:middle line:90%
doing these private readings.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And right when I
announced I was going

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.540 align:middle line:84%
to start doing
them in galleries,

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.415 align:middle line:90%
people came flocking.

00:39:19.415 --> 00:39:20.526 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just exploded.

00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: And it's amazing for me.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.982 align:middle line:84%
I don't use the
machine for myself.

00:39:24.982 --> 00:39:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't try to communicate with
my loved ones or my friends

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.190 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.730 align:middle line:90%
I have no desire to.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:32.002 align:middle line:84%
But I live through
their readings.

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:33.710 align:middle line:84%
When they're able to
connect with a loved

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.800 align:middle line:84%
one on the other side and
have that missed communication

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.450 align:middle line:84%
that they had, or
just the confirmation,

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.400 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely incredible.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, couple
of questions here.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.685 align:middle line:90%
First, let's go back.

00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:46.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go back and
then come forward again.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:47.352 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Sure.

00:39:47.352 --> 00:39:49.351 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you were
at Sallie House and some

00:39:49.351 --> 00:39:51.840 align:middle line:84%
of these places, you had to
deal with a lot of interference

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and even being attacked
by some of these entities.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.821 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:56.237 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:39:56.237 --> 00:39:58.570 align:middle line:84%
How you experienced it, how
you learned to deal with it,

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.027 align:middle line:90%
and what you felt was going on.

00:40:00.027 --> 00:40:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to move
to the more benevolent side

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.209 align:middle line:90%
of the story.

00:40:03.209 --> 00:40:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, you
know the first time

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:07.890 align:middle line:84%
that I was ever attacked by a
spirit was at the Sallie House.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was an
incredible experience,

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.980 align:middle line:90%
frightening beyond words.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, we
were at the house.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.670 align:middle line:84%
To give you some quick
background on that,

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I had seen the television
show "Sightings" in the 1990s.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And I would always
tell people around me

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.307 align:middle line:84%
this looks terribly
fake me, where

00:40:26.307 --> 00:40:28.640 align:middle line:84%
the person who was living
there was apparently scratched

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.980 align:middle line:84%
by an unseen spirit, and you
could see the scratch marks

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.646 align:middle line:84%
appear, and then the
blood would appear.

00:40:32.646 --> 00:40:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I think
this is Hollywood.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
really anything to it.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.487 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if I ever
have the opportunity,

00:40:37.487 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
investigate the Sallie

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.990 align:middle line:84%
House, because I
want to prove what's

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.570 align:middle line:90%
really there or not there.

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So lo and behold,
many years later,

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:47.307 align:middle line:84%
I was contacted by
the town of Atchison.

00:40:47.307 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing a haunted
trolley tour through town.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I think they still
do that today.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And they contacted
me, and they said,

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.366 align:middle line:84%
we'd love for you to come in
and do investigations of some

00:40:55.366 --> 00:40:56.770 align:middle line:90%
of our haunted properties here.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we'd be
happy to do that.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:90%
We'd be happy to do a story.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But my one requirement is
I have to be granted access

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.299 align:middle line:90%
to the Sallie House.

00:41:04.299 --> 00:41:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we just
had a really bad experience that

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.980 align:middle line:90%
happened there.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.480 align:middle line:84%
There was a lady who moved in,
and she was a quote, unquote,

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.520 align:middle line:84%
witch who used dark powers
and things like that,

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and she'd done some sacrifices
of animals in the basement,

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and had torn all the carpet
out, and they're cleaning it up,

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and we really don't know
if it's a good idea.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
those are my terms.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:23.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm happy to go in.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK.

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:25.660 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Dead of winter, we
showed up there.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.910 align:middle line:84%
We did investigations of
all the properties there,

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.040 align:middle line:84%
but that night we went in
to do the Sallie House.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.915 align:middle line:10%
And it was fascinating
when we went in there,

00:41:32.915 --> 00:41:34.801 align:middle line:10%
because the whole time
had heard about this.

00:41:34.801 --> 00:41:36.550 align:middle line:10%
We had people lined
up and down the street

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.090 align:middle line:10%
as we were going in to do it.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.710 align:middle line:10%
And the first time that
we went into the house,

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:42.210 align:middle line:10%
it was extremely quiet.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.870 align:middle line:90%
And I thought to myself, ahah.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:44.820 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing here.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And I walked in, and
I couldn't believe

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.320 align:middle line:84%
the condition of the
house was terrible.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.819 align:middle line:84%
But I was walking
through the house,

00:41:49.819 --> 00:41:51.260 align:middle line:90%
and I started asking questions.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was happening
until we got upstairs

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:56.620 align:middle line:84%
into a front bedroom, a closet
area in the front bedroom.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.310 align:middle line:90%
And we did an EVP session.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And we started hearing
this little girl's voice

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.242 align:middle line:90%
come through.

00:42:01.242 --> 00:42:02.700 align:middle line:84%
We thought, OK,
well, maybe there's

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.150 align:middle line:90%
something going on here.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:06.629 align:middle line:84%
So we went downstairs,
and started

00:42:06.629 --> 00:42:09.170 align:middle line:84%
doing a few more things, and it
started getting very intense.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So eventually some of the
newspapers that were with us,

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and some of the TV crews
decided that we've had enough.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:15.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
ahead and leave.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.102 align:middle line:84%
So we were standing there
in the kitchen area.

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:19.060 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget this.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I was holding a trifield natural
EMF meter, doing readings

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.110 align:middle line:90%
on the back wall.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.740 align:middle line:90%
And it was spiking.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling
everyone around me,

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that this might
be a vortex back here,

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.579 align:middle line:84%
because this seems to have
a lot of energy to it.

00:42:31.579 --> 00:42:33.120 align:middle line:84%
About that time, it
felt like someone

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.790 align:middle line:84%
had taken and nail and
driven it with a hammer

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.030 align:middle line:90%
through the back of my head.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I grabbed the back of my head.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I had my hair back
in a pony tail.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.492 align:middle line:90%
And I was falling to the floor.

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:43.491 align:middle line:84%
Of course, everybody
started pulling hair apart.

00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:44.319 align:middle line:90%
No concern for me.

00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:46.610 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling my hair apart
to see what had happened.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had a huge red
welt that developed

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:49.670 align:middle line:90%
on the back of my head.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were filming
this as this was happening

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.170 align:middle line:90%
for the Topeka Station.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:55.939 align:middle line:84%
And I stood up, and my
partner Jeff at the time

00:42:55.939 --> 00:42:56.730 align:middle line:90%
said we need to go.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.490 align:middle line:90%
This is a bad scenario.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it is, but we
need to see what's going on.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.465 align:middle line:84%
So I took out my
recorder, and I started

00:43:03.465 --> 00:43:05.465 align:middle line:84%
addressing the little
girl, because she'd always

00:43:05.465 --> 00:43:07.210 align:middle line:90%
been blamed for the attacks.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Sallie,
why are you doing this?

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why
you're hurting people here,

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:12.694 align:middle line:90%
and I went on, and on, and on.

00:43:12.694 --> 00:43:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was happening, and
then all of a sudden the spirit

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:15.837 align:middle line:90%
spoke to me.

00:43:15.837 --> 00:43:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wait a minute.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.320 align:middle line:90%
This isn't Sallie at all, is it?

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, this is the doctor.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You're the doctor
who killed her.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
the room went ice cold.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.994 align:middle line:84%
The hair shot up on
everybody's arms.

00:43:26.994 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
it felt someone

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:31.220 align:middle line:84%
took a hot clothes iron
that your iron clothes with

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and stuck it to the
side of my face.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.870 align:middle line:84%
I felt this burning
sensation happen.

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And the most fascinating
thing about this

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.050 align:middle line:84%
was it wasn't an
outside pressure.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:44.730 align:middle line:84%
It felt like the energy was
coming from me, creating this.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.789 align:middle line:84%
So it started at the top
my ear, and went down

00:43:46.789 --> 00:43:47.830 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom of my neck.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:51.467 align:middle line:84%
And this huge red burn developed
from the top to the bottom.

00:43:51.467 --> 00:43:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you could
see heat waves coming off

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.370 align:middle line:84%
on the camera and
things like that.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was yelling and
screaming at this doctor.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Energy drained from
me about like that.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.930 align:middle line:84%
My friend carried me
out of the location,

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:05.070 align:middle line:90%
and we closed the door.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And I remember as we
were leaving there,

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.851 align:middle line:84%
I was looking back, and
there was flashing lights

00:44:08.851 --> 00:44:10.289 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the house.

00:44:10.289 --> 00:44:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't dawn
on me at the time,

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.500 align:middle line:84%
but there was no electricity
in that house whatsoever.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.950 align:middle line:90%
The house had no electricity.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So all of that energy
that had built up

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.317 align:middle line:90%
was coming back through.

00:44:20.317 --> 00:44:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And while the attack
was taking place,

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I realized there was nothing
I could do to stop the attack.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I had to wait until this
entity ran out of energy.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.941 align:middle line:84%
And who knows how far that
really would have gone?

00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was the
story that happened

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:35.900 align:middle line:90%
about the doctor and Sallie?

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: There's been a
lot of different versions

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.970 align:middle line:90%
of the story.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The thing that we've
been able to find out

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.460 align:middle line:84%
through using the
telephone-- basically,

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.020 align:middle line:90%
there was a young girl.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We actually have been able
to go back and research.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Sallie.

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that she
was the illegitimate daughter

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:56.280 align:middle line:84%
of the doctor who
lived in that house.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.970 align:middle line:90%
She was African-American.

00:44:57.970 --> 00:44:59.150 align:middle line:90%
He was white.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:01.784 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at that time, it
was a whole different scenario.

00:45:01.784 --> 00:45:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.325 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: And she had
developed some stomach pains

00:45:05.325 --> 00:45:06.450 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And the mother, eventually
with nowhere else to go,

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:84%
went to his house, and said,
you need to help our daughter.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
he took her in.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.559 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
is, he didn't take her

00:45:15.559 --> 00:45:17.600 align:middle line:84%
to what was considered
his operating area.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.550 align:middle line:84%
He took her upstairs
to the bedroom.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.280 align:middle line:84%
That's where he did
what he needed to do.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.040 align:middle line:84%
He determines she had
acute appendicitis.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.480 align:middle line:84%
There was no one
else in the room.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And from what was
said that had happened

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.296 align:middle line:84%
is that he gave her ether to
put her under at that point,

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:33.420 align:middle line:90%
but didn't give her enough.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.961 align:middle line:84%
And he started to
perform the surgery

00:45:34.961 --> 00:45:36.480 align:middle line:90%
while she was still alive.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.230 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, is
that he killed her.

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:40.510 align:middle line:84%
He took the
opportunity kill her.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:42.245 align:middle line:90%
Her spirit is still there.

00:45:42.245 --> 00:45:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And obviously, his
is bound to it on some level

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:45.000 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.791 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:47.260 align:middle line:90%
His mistress is there as well.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.270 align:middle line:84%
There's several spirits
in that location,

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't take
much to bring them out.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
conversely moving forward,

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.920 align:middle line:84%
when you started
making the spirit

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.820 align:middle line:84%
phone available
for people who were

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.710 align:middle line:84%
trying to connect
with their loved ones,

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.500 align:middle line:90%
what did that teach you?

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.790 align:middle line:84%
What was the kind
of preponderance,

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:12.424 align:middle line:84%
or maybe the most common theme
of the messages coming through?

00:46:12.424 --> 00:46:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, it was
amazing, because I really

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what to expect
when I first started doing it.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who I was
going to connect to,

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and I realized very
quickly it was a process.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.860 align:middle line:84%
I would turn on the machine,
and it was just strictly

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.570 align:middle line:90%
by trial and error, really.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:28.810 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, technicians assist.

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, we would hear
the voices of the technicians

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:32.730 align:middle line:90%
come through.

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I would have verifications
with them, things

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.851 align:middle line:90%
that I'd arrange in advance.

00:46:36.851 --> 00:46:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Give me a code word,
let me know it's you.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.599 align:middle line:84%
They'd give me the word,
and then at that point,

00:46:40.599 --> 00:46:41.410 align:middle line:90%
we'd move forward.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:42.250 align:middle line:90%
I'd ask the person.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, can you please
give me your name?

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And they would give
their full name.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.270 align:middle line:90%
We'd wait.

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.250 align:middle line:84%
The entity, the technician,
would come through,

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and at that point, say,
got it, or let's go,

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.969 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case might be.

00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, who are we
trying to speak to today?

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.384 align:middle line:84%
And then they
would give the name

00:46:55.384 --> 00:46:56.929 align:middle line:90%
of that person to come through.

00:46:56.929 --> 00:46:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And we would wait,
and we would wait,

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.479 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
say, OK, go ahead.

00:47:00.479 --> 00:47:02.020 align:middle line:84%
But the most amazing
thing about that

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.520 align:middle line:84%
is, almost immediately
that person's voice

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.560 align:middle line:90%
would shoot through.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Hello, hi, a laugh, something.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And to watch a person hear
that voice that they never

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.920 align:middle line:84%
thought that they were
going to hear again

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.350 align:middle line:84%
was just absolutely
mind-altering to me,

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:21.260 align:middle line:84%
because they would just
be so shaken by it,

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.980 align:middle line:90%
but in a positive way.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Daddy, that's you?

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.915 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd hear
a cry or a laugh,

00:47:26.915 --> 00:47:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and they'd start having this
conversation back and forth.

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing thing
about it that a lot of people

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:32.486 align:middle line:84%
don't even realize
today when they

00:47:32.486 --> 00:47:34.160 align:middle line:84%
get into one-on-one
sessions, it's

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.670 align:middle line:84%
not just that person
who's over there.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.410 align:middle line:90%
The family's together.

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And if they're on
the other side,

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.020 align:middle line:84%
you'll start hearing all the
different voices come through.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people, don't go
in asking a million questions.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Don't say, what was the color of
my carpet in the house in 1973.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Let it happen.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.456 align:middle line:84%
I tell that to believers
and skeptics alike.

00:47:54.456 --> 00:47:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing thing
is, is that they'll just

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.496 align:middle line:90%
start popping through.

00:47:57.496 --> 00:47:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Grandma will come through,
her aunt, someone.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have these
amazing connections.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And by the time it's all
over with, they'll be,

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I went in to talk
to this person,

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.291 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up talking
to my entire family.

00:48:07.291 --> 00:48:08.670 align:middle line:90%
That was incredible.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I've really been blessed
to be invited around the world

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and have people invite
me in to do these things.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's just an
amazing experience.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do the beings ever
after this experience say,

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I've just been waiting
to talk to you,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.442 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to move on now?

00:48:24.442 --> 00:48:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, most
of the time when

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.816 align:middle line:84%
we deal with spirits
through the spirit phone,

00:48:27.816 --> 00:48:28.600 align:middle line:90%
they have crossed.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:84%
They are through to
the other side, what

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:90%
some people would call heaven.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.710 align:middle line:90%
They are on that other side.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this just a
lingering aspect of them?

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: No, this is a direct,
intelligent communication.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like a
phone call from heaven.

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.980 align:middle line:90%
You have the family together.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.190 align:middle line:84%
There is no physical
existence, obviously there.

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And they have this
group consciousness,

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:50.280 align:middle line:90%
being together on that side.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're projecting to
each other that they're there,

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're projecting back
to us all those energies,

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and talking about our lives
here today, as they watch things

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:02.510 align:middle line:84%
happening, children growing, and
life occurrences that happen.

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And they'll comment
on those things.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:07.610 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe that so-and-so's
gotten so big, or you know,

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:11.470 align:middle line:84%
sometimes when she stares off
into the distance, that's me.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And the clients, the
people on this side,

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.675 align:middle line:90%
they'll hold their mouth.

00:49:15.675 --> 00:49:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Oh my, I always thought
that that was my dad.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I always thought
that that was that.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So they're having these
beautiful conversations

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:22.960 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And the other side of
this is when someone's

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:30.137 align:middle line:84%
trapped in that earthbound
state, in the purgatory state,

00:49:30.137 --> 00:49:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and they've made the
decision not to move through,

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.136 align:middle line:84%
and the family's waiting
for them on one side,

00:49:34.136 --> 00:49:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and we're over here,
and we're actually

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.940 align:middle line:90%
able to do the crossing.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:41.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
emotional experience,

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.500 align:middle line:84%
because what'll
happen is that someone

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.730 align:middle line:84%
will go into one
of these sessions,

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:47.190 align:middle line:84%
basically expecting that someone
will be on the other side,

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:49.481 align:middle line:84%
and find out that they're
trapped in the middle ground.

00:49:49.481 --> 00:49:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And this person is trapped
in this dreamlike state.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.100 align:middle line:84%
They're having
trouble communicating.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain to
them what's happening.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.876 align:middle line:84%
They get very upset
at that point,

00:49:56.876 --> 00:49:58.120 align:middle line:90%
but I'll tell them it's OK.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.550 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get them through.

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk to them.

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:03.380 align:middle line:84%
The technician appears to them
as an actual, physical being,

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:04.850 align:middle line:90%
which is very interesting to me.

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The first time they have
seen a physical being

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:08.220 align:middle line:90%
since their passing.

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:09.487 align:middle line:90%
And I'll talk to them.

00:50:09.487 --> 00:50:11.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll hear their loved
ones voice from our side.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.653 align:middle line:84%
So they're hearing my
voice, the loved ones voice.

00:50:13.653 --> 00:50:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And we actually talk to
them, and tell them it's OK.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:17.991 align:middle line:84%
There is no punishment
on the other side.

00:50:17.991 --> 00:50:18.990 align:middle line:90%
They're waiting for you.

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It's time to move through.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.352 align:middle line:84%
And we do-- as crazy
as this sounds.

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:23.310 align:middle line:90%
I know it sounds crazy.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:24.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't.

00:50:24.185 --> 00:50:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: We do a visualization
exercise with them,

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.511 align:middle line:84%
where we say imagine
closing your eyes.

00:50:28.511 --> 00:50:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Look to the right.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.040 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.340 align:middle line:84%
They always say,
nothing, darkness,

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.250 align:middle line:90%
whatever the case might be.

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Look forward.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.690 align:middle line:90%
What you see?

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Nothing, darkness.

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.580 align:middle line:90%
Look to the left.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.455 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you see.

00:50:36.455 --> 00:50:39.036 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, that light
is always right there for them.

00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to convince
them, it's time to go.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.492 align:middle line:90%
It's time to move on.

00:50:42.492 --> 00:50:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a wonderful
assist you're doing.

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: It's amazing.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.475 align:middle line:90%
It's heartwarming.

00:50:47.475 --> 00:50:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear
them walking through,

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're talking
to the technician,

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and we're encouraging
them, come on.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
make that ascension,

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.000 align:middle line:84%
you hear the family laughing,
and crying, and hugging,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're, "thank
you, thank you."

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:00.810 align:middle line:90%
And their voice gets very clear.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:01.809 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, beautiful.

00:51:01.809 --> 00:51:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: And you'll hear
actual angel choirs come up.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:06.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear all
these amazing things.

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And these people look to
me, and thank you so much.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell them,
I say it's not me.

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:12.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm just the operator here.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm just I'm blessed
to be a part of what's

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.010 align:middle line:84%
taking place here, just to
witness it happening and help.

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:19.206 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:51:19.206 --> 00:51:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:22.506 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to a few
voices from your site.

00:51:22.506 --> 00:51:23.880 align:middle line:84%
People can go and
listen to them,

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:28.194 align:middle line:84%
but pick out, let's say,
three that are really clear,

00:51:28.194 --> 00:51:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and give us the title
of those, and we'll just

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:31.090 align:middle line:90%
listen for a sec.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:32.332 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:51:32.332 --> 00:51:33.790 align:middle line:84%
One that I would
put on there would

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:37.740 align:middle line:84%
be Lincoln, the message
that came through there.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.350 align:middle line:84%
We've actually had communication
with Abraham Lincoln.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And we had a woman
who came and did

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.114 align:middle line:84%
a session with me that was
very skeptical we first met.

00:51:47.114 --> 00:51:48.530 align:middle line:84%
But we sat down
and did a session.

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Her friend had just passed,
and he was absolutely obsessed

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:53.140 align:middle line:90%
with Abraham Lincoln.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we asked
him is there anybody

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that you'd like to meet,
or anyone you've talked to.

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And he comes through
and he says, Lincoln.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.930 align:middle line:90%
You can hear it clear as day.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's listen to that.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.790 align:middle line:10%
>>CLIENT: While I have
you on the line here,

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.122 align:middle line:10%
have you got to meet
Abraham Lincoln yet?

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:07.104 align:middle line:10%
>>SPIRIT: Lincoln!

00:52:07.104 --> 00:52:09.939 align:middle line:10%
>>CLIENT: Lincoln?

00:52:09.939 --> 00:52:10.980 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I know he's thrilled.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:11.730 align:middle line:10%
>>MOON: Thank you.

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.110 align:middle line:10%
What a great confirmation.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:13.890 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:15.690 align:middle line:10%
>>SPIRIT: Bill's with us.

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:16.750 align:middle line:10%
>>MOON: Bill's with us.

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:18.250 align:middle line:10%
Do you want to give
a specific name,

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.890 align:middle line:10%
or do you want Lisa
to give you a name?

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:21.840 align:middle line:10%
>>SPIRIT: The Captain.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.840 align:middle line:10%
We're working hard here.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:23.740 align:middle line:10%
>>MOON: Why?

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:27.014 align:middle line:10%
Why name what's been working--

00:52:27.014 --> 00:52:28.930 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, I know
people can go to the site

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:30.120 align:middle line:10%
after they're done
watching this,

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.000 align:middle line:10%
and you have, I don't know,
a couple dozen at least.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.470 align:middle line:90%
There are maybe more than that.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
hear for themselves.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:36.584 align:middle line:84%
And I like the
way you set it up,

00:52:36.584 --> 00:52:39.640 align:middle line:84%
because it shows the
dialogue surrounding it,

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.490 align:middle line:84%
what the Q&A was, and then
you hear the excerpts,

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:44.119 align:middle line:90%
so it's not just out of context.

00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Absolutely.

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You did an
excellent job on that.

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Thank you.

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:49.619 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know, one
thing I wanted to bring up

00:52:49.619 --> 00:52:53.640 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that Frank's
box, that there were

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.970 align:middle line:90%
others that were built, right?

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Yes.

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:57.553 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Many others, but
they didn't necessarily

00:52:57.553 --> 00:52:58.820 align:middle line:90%
work for other people.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.726 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, yeah, that's the
interesting thing about it.

00:53:01.726 --> 00:53:03.100 align:middle line:84%
My father and I
were the ones who

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.470 align:middle line:84%
named it Frank's box, because
we had no other name for it.

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:06.136 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:06.136 --> 00:53:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: And Frank
has since passed.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.870 align:middle line:90%
He died last year.

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:09.966 align:middle line:90%
It was very sad for us.

00:53:09.966 --> 00:53:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I spoke at his funeral.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
contribution he made.

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: The loss of Frank,
people I don't think

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:20.440 align:middle line:84%
will really realize for dozens
of years how important he was.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.677 align:middle line:84%
Being physical medium
and being able to bring

00:53:22.677 --> 00:53:24.260 align:middle line:84%
through this technology,
because there

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.180 align:middle line:84%
is no one that we've found to
this point who can do this,

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.684 align:middle line:90%
other than Frank.

00:53:28.684 --> 00:53:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So the machines
that are out there

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.270 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to last,
the ones that we have left.

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:34.936 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, but, again, they
don't respond to just anybody's

00:53:34.936 --> 00:53:35.860 align:middle line:90%
use as a technician.

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.786 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: They don't.

00:53:37.786 --> 00:53:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you put this down to?

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:40.826 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Well, the
one thing that's

00:53:40.826 --> 00:53:44.000 align:middle line:84%
interesting about this is that
I think everybody has a purpose.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And not to discredit
anyone, but being a medium,

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I definitely have ability
to power the device

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and receive messages
back through.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And when people
say, well, why you?

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:56.177 align:middle line:84%
Why is it just you
who can do this?

00:53:56.177 --> 00:53:57.510 align:middle line:90%
I think it's like anything else.

00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I think there's great
musicians out there.

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:00.656 align:middle line:84%
I think there's great
writers out there.

00:54:00.656 --> 00:54:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that we all have
something in this world

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:84%
that we're meant to do,
and I think this is my one

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.645 align:middle line:84%
thing that I was really meant
to do, was to use this device

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and bring through these
messages for people.

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And Edison, we've researched
him, and one thing that he had

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.520 align:middle line:84%
is something that he
called useful idiots,

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.190 align:middle line:90%
as crazy as that sounds.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of my attendees was
the one who told me about this.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Basically, he said
what Edison would

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.950 align:middle line:84%
do is he'd hire
people that were very

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:29.780 align:middle line:84%
good at doing one specific
thing, but not everything.

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Frank had the ability to get
the messages, tune the boards,

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.750 align:middle line:84%
build the machines the way
that he wanted them built.

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I have the ability
to use the machines,

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:38.866 align:middle line:84%
and take them out,
and show people

00:54:38.866 --> 00:54:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that this is a true
spirit communication that

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:42.467 align:middle line:90%
can take place.

00:54:42.467 --> 00:54:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But I don't built the
machines, and Frank couldn't

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:45.260 align:middle line:90%
interpret the machines.

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, so it
sounds like it didn't matter

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:49.630 align:middle line:84%
how many were built.
This was actually

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:52.560 align:middle line:84%
meant to be a collaboration
between the two of you.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: Absolutely,
and you lose a lot

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:56.930 align:middle line:90%
of people in this lifetime.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:58.422 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:54:58.422 --> 00:54:59.880 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
loss of Frank to me

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.990 align:middle line:84%
has been one of the
most devastating losses

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.840 align:middle line:90%
that I've had.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.591 align:middle line:84%
Though I speak to Frank
on the other side.

00:55:04.591 --> 00:55:06.673 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does he come
through his own technology?

00:55:06.673 --> 00:55:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Oh, absolutely, he does.

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's he
saying these days?

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: He is the same
curmudgeon old man

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:13.312 align:middle line:84%
that he always was,
and I love him for it.

00:55:13.312 --> 00:55:15.549 align:middle line:10%
These technicians
who come through,

00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:16.590 align:middle line:10%
they're interdimensional.

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:17.810 align:middle line:10%
There's some who've
lived here and died.

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:20.410 align:middle line:10%
There's those who've never
existed on this plane that

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:21.920 align:middle line:10%
come through and help us.

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.900 align:middle line:84%
But they're always
there to assist us

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.380 align:middle line:84%
in this bridge, this
communication gap.

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Frank is not there to do that.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:29.755 align:middle line:84%
Frank is there to complain
about the technology not

00:55:29.755 --> 00:55:32.100 align:middle line:90%
being what he wants it to be.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
between the two of us

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.670 align:middle line:84%
is that he'll give
me information

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:36.750 align:middle line:90%
on a consistent basis.

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.140 align:middle line:84%
You need to do this,
you need to do that.

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But he knows I don't have
mechanical bone in my body,

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
that I could do with it.

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds like you need
to bring another player in who

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:44.580 align:middle line:90%
might understand that.

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.692 align:middle line:90%
And I've asked him.

00:55:46.692 --> 00:55:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I've thrown it to the
universe, and said,

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.775 align:middle line:84%
if there's somebody
out there who

00:55:49.775 --> 00:55:52.850 align:middle line:84%
can come in, and help us pick
up the next stage, let's do it.

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's take that next step.

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An audio engineering
genius of some kind.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: They would have to be
an audio engineering genius,

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:03.730 align:middle line:84%
but they also have to
be a physical medium.

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
thing with Frank.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:07.225 align:middle line:84%
Up until the very
end, he thought

00:56:07.225 --> 00:56:08.380 align:middle line:90%
that anybody could do this.

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
beauty of Frank.

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.180 align:middle line:84%
He thought that anybody could
build these things, anybody

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.420 align:middle line:90%
you could use these things.

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, that got
him into a lot of trouble,

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:16.120 align:middle line:84%
because he'd hand out
machines to people

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.092 align:middle line:84%
who had no ability to use
it, or had very ill intent

00:56:19.092 --> 00:56:21.050 align:middle line:84%
on what they were going
to do with the machine.

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Didn't work.

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: And it didn't work.

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But when I would
go in, and I'd say,

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:25.080 align:middle line:90%
what makes Frank so special?

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And I sat with him while
he built an entire machine.

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was most boring
process in the world.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But when he got to
the point that he

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.047 align:middle line:84%
was tuning one of the boards,
and he'd just have these two

00:56:34.047 --> 00:56:34.880 align:middle line:90%
little screwdrivers.

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:35.960 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget it.

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.626 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking to
me as he always did.

00:56:37.626 --> 00:56:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Blah-blah-blah.

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
I know, he stopped.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The eyes rolled up in
the back of his head.

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.590 align:middle line:84%
The head went back, and
his hands kept moving.

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching this, and all
of sudden, I heard it click.

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I heard the voices come through,
and Frank snapped back in.

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And he goes yup, like I told
you, anybody can do this.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.039 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: He had no idea
that he had that ability.

00:56:57.039 --> 00:56:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So it is going to take somebody
who's been chosen to do this.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I have faith in the universe
that there will be that person.

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, for now
and for many more years,

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.448 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you're doing it now.

00:57:06.448 --> 00:57:07.580 align:middle line:90%
You have kids, right?

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: I do.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I have my daughter, and then I
have my stepdaughter as well.

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I hope
they never had one of these

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:17.280 align:middle line:90%
bring your dad to school.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.620 align:middle line:90%
You know those days?

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:20.230 align:middle line:84%
What do you do
for a living, sir?

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Exactly.

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do your
kids respond to all of this?

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.371 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Well, it's interesting.

00:57:24.371 --> 00:57:26.790 align:middle line:84%
My daughter has really
grown up with all this.

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:30.902 align:middle line:84%
Because right about the time
that she was very young,

00:57:30.902 --> 00:57:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I was just starting to really
explore these different types

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:33.860 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So she's seen things that
most people will never

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:38.810 align:middle line:90%
see in their entire lifetime.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:42.590 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of it, being
a teenager today, 18 years old,

00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:45.410 align:middle line:84%
graduating high school, and
all that kind of fun stuff,

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:46.900 align:middle line:90%
she shies away from it.

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Our ability is hereditary.

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It's been handed down
through so many different--

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Does she have it too?

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: She definitely has it.

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:55.922 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to watch
her, because it frightens her.

00:57:55.922 --> 00:57:58.130 align:middle line:84%
She's seen some of the good
things that have happened

00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:59.350 align:middle line:90%
to me, which has been amazing.

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And she's also seen
the not so good things

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.010 align:middle line:90%
that have happened too.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And it scares her to death.

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.288 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Too not
ready for it yet.

00:58:04.288 --> 00:58:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MOON: No, and I'm never
going to pressure her into it.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:08.030 align:middle line:90%
I know it'll happen one day.

00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:10.363 align:middle line:84%
I know it'll click for her,
and good things will happen,

00:58:10.363 --> 00:58:11.545 align:middle line:90%
but not yet.

00:58:11.545 --> 00:58:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other hand,
my stepdaughter is absolutely

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.990 align:middle line:84%
fascinated with it,
and she shows me off

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:17.700 align:middle line:90%
like I'm some kind of trophy.

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet she does.

00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for your
contributions in this area.

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've
given comfort to,

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:27.810 align:middle line:84%
along with Frank's technology,
to many, many people.

00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:29.440 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like
thousands of people.

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And so people will be able to
get hold of you after this,

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.230 align:middle line:90%
won't they?

00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Yes.

00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, very good.

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MOON: Thank you.

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:38.531 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To learn more
