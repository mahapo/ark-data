00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH:
I'm here in Scottsdale,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.194 align:middle line:10%
Arizona at the
International UFO Congress,

00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:10%
where I've had a chance to catch
up with some of the top experts

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:10%
in the field.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday I spoke
with David Marler,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:84%
who is an expert in examining
the increasing instances

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.095 align:middle line:84%
and sightings of those shadowy
triangular craft in the sky.

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
David, you've been
interested in this subject

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:90%
since the age of five.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.699 align:middle line:84%
So one might say,
what happened at five?

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID MARLER: [LAUGHS]

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
movie did you see?

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:10%
>> MARLER: Well, I don't recall
seeing any particular movie.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.255 align:middle line:10%
But in 1973, there was a
famous wave of UFO sightings

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:10%
in and around the town
of Piedmont, Missouri,

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:10%
and it garnered a lot
of local media attention

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:10%
in the St. Louis area,
where I lived at the time.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Of particular note,
the primary witness

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
that really launched the wave
of sightings, so to speak,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:84%
the first
well-publicized sighting,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:90%
was by a man named Reggie Bone.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And Reggie Bone happened to be
my dad's best friend growing up

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
in and around the area
of Piedmont, Missouri.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at age
five the excitement

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the sightings
that were occurring,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
the fact that local media
was going down there.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of St. Louis residents
were gravitating down there

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:84%
to quote, unquote, "look for
UFOs on weekends," driving out

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
there with their thermoses
of coffee and what have you.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I heard
about that, and then

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I also saw the excitement
within my own home.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
My father was always
interested in the UFO subject.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And both he and my sister
and my older brothers

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:84%
were piling in the car, like a
lot of people were at the time,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.094 align:middle line:84%
and rushing down there,
spending the night,

00:01:58.094 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:90%
and then driving back.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What a fun
thing for a little kid.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: It was exciting.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.907 align:middle line:84%
But I was five
years old, so I was

00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:04.864 align:middle line:84%
tasked with the job of
staying home and staying

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:06.656 align:middle line:84%
with my mother, who
had, as I like to say,

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
as much in the
way of disinterest

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.320 align:middle line:90%
regarding the UFO subject.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Aw.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: But they
would come back,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.359 align:middle line:84%
and I would be picking
up on this excitement,

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
because they had talked
to police officers.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%
They had talked to
citizens down there that

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
were reporting seeing
these very unusual lights

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.574 align:middle line:90%
and object in the sky.

00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did they get some
good photography back in that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.952 align:middle line:90%
day of these objects?

00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: They actually
obtained a lot of good

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.710 align:middle line:84%
photographic evidence,
and not just photographs,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.846 align:middle line:90%
photographic evidence.

00:02:33.846 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Because one of
the gentleman that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
went down there at the time
was Dr. Harley Rutledge,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
who was the physics professor
from Southeast Missouri State

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:90%
University.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:10%
And he took infrared
photography.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:10%
He took standard photography.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:10%
They were measuring the lights.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:10%
They were measuring the angular
distance of these things.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:10%
And he was initially a skeptic.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:10%
But after several years of
doing field work down there

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:10%
and collecting data
real time in the field,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:10%
he wrote a book,
"Project Identification"

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:10%
and went from being a UFO
skeptic to a quote, unquote,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:10%
"UFO believer."

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a very
interesting time.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now these were during
that time more of saucers,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.954 align:middle line:90%
the saucer shaped craft.

00:03:10.954 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Down in that area,
they were reporting saucers.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
They were reporting
lights in the sky.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.239 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the
feeling that people had,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
from what you just said,
was one of excitement.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:90%
This was hopeful.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.164 align:middle line:84%
This was an exciting outing
of potential contact, right?

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I have a
huge case file of the newspaper

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
articles from the time where
they're interviewing people,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.644 align:middle line:84%
and at no time do you find any
apprehension, any nervousness,

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:84%
People were just in
the state of wonder.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:90%
What were these UFOs?

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Why are they suddenly here?

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.302 align:middle line:84%
And it basically woke up a
sleepy little agricultural

00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
community, because other
than that there wasn't

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:84%
much going on in
that small town.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
let me as you this.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.754 align:middle line:84%
Was there any other phenomena
that followed in its wake?

00:03:57.754 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:84%
You know how sometimes when
you have a lot, a clus--

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:90%
you know what I'm saying.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you have
a cluster of sightings,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
people have maybe a different
aptitude that awakens

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.235 align:middle line:84%
or a different
feeling about life.

00:04:08.235 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Do yo know what I'm saying?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Some of the
witnesses had that experience.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.550 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, they
had some Bigfoot sightings

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.547 align:middle line:90%
down there at the time.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.671 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: So there were some
witnesses claiming to have seen

00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot, claimING
to have seen UFOs.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, yeah,
it seems like maybe they

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
were opened up to
other possibilities.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: But it definitely
made an indelible impression.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my father's aunt just
passed away several years ago,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:90%
just about six, seven years ago.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
She was in her
90s, and she still

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.874 align:middle line:84%
used to recount the
stories of the UFO

00:04:40.874 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
sightings and the people
that she knew in that area.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a
very small community.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knew everyone.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's a
life-altering experience.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: It is.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And not only that,
to have the joy of having

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.342 align:middle line:84%
experienced it together
as a community.

00:04:54.342 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: That's a good
point, because it really was

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:90%
a community atmosphere.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
The sheriff endorsed
the fact that, yes,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
there are credible
sightings occurring here.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Denny Hovis, who was one of
the radio station operators--

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I met him several years
ago and interviewed him--

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and he ran the
local radio station.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And the sense of
community came through.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.609 align:middle line:84%
Because people would either
go to the police station,

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:19.525 align:middle line:84%
or if the sheriff wasn't
in they would go over

00:05:19.525 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
to Denny at the radio
station because he

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:84%
was broadcasting and
talking about it.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So people were readily
coming in with new accounts

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
of what they had seen
the night before.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.155 align:middle line:84%
So it was very much so
a community atmosphere.

00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And did you
say this was around 1973?

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: '73 is when
it started, April of '73.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And then it continued
on for several years,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.497 align:middle line:90%
depending on who you talk to.

00:05:39.497 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.930 align:middle line:90%
That was '73.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And so if we go back into the
'40s and even prior to that

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and all the classic
types of sightings

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other
people I've interviewed

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.015 align:middle line:84%
and the archives
of some of them,

00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
like George Adamski and others,
these kinds of experiences

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.215 align:middle line:84%
with the beings-- now
there were many people that

00:05:58.215 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:84%
were taken aboard these
craft, it sounds like.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And there is even some testimony
that President Eisenhower

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:84%
was one of those
individuals that

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.519 align:middle line:90%
may have gone on board a craft.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Correct.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK?

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we're looking at a
type of elevated conversation

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:90%
that was happening aboard.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
In each case, the
people, the witnesses--

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I won't say abductees--
those who went on board,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
talk about being shown
technology, future,

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.464 align:middle line:84%
the capabilities of humankind,
what we could evolve into,

00:06:32.464 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:90%
higher thought, so to speak.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.546 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:06:34.546 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But somewhere along
the way, something changed.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.445 align:middle line:84%
And when you come to events
like this at the UFO Congress,

00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:90%
you hear the full spectrum.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so you
have the light of it,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be-- now I
think it's important to note

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
these were human contacts in all
of those cases in the past with

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:90%
the saucers.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Yes.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.065 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Kind of like "The Day
the Earth Stood Still," right?

00:06:58.065 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: The early accounts
of direct contact were with

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:84%
the space brothers, were
with humanoid or human-like

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:90%
individuals.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Like Valiant Thor.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.869 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: They
looked just like us.

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, Valiant Thor.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they're
usually very good-looking,

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:90%
well-dressed human beings.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Yes, very
eloquent, very well-educated.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:84%
They just have an aura about
them, as is often described.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That was recognizable
as being something more

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.925 align:middle line:84%
elegant, more elevated,
more something.

00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Different.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That je ne sais quoi.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Exactly.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.425 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: As good
a word as any.

00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that je ne sais
quoi isn't feeling the same way

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.572 align:middle line:84%
now with the types of abductions
that we're hearing more about.

00:07:35.572 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Right.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: John Mack and his
work studied quite a bit.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
You go into great detail,
so it's indisputable

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
that these triangular
craft, these deltoid craft

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:84%
have been sighted all
over the planet for quite

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:90%
a long time now.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a long, rich history.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.399 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm
wondering about that.

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:90%
We'll just start with feelings.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:84%
What is the feeling of
people when they encounter

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
those particular craft, as
opposed to the days in Missouri

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:90%
when you were young?

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Well, I think
just by virtue of the objects

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
themselves that are reported,
the scale of these objects are

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
somewhat intimidating
to a lot of witnesses.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say necessarily
fear, but intimidation

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:84%
is a feeling that is often
conveyed by the witnesses,

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:84%
because they're so large and
they're directly overhead.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:10%
As I describe in
my book, they're

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.082 align:middle line:10%
unambiguous UFO sightings.

00:08:30.082 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:10%
It's not a matter of
did I see something?

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:10%
It was bloody obvious that
they had seen something.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thousands of people
see it because it's a mile long

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:90%
and it's hovering overhead.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.049 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:38.674 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:08:38.674 --> 00:08:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: So just based on the
description of these objects,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:84%
the scale, it conveys a sense
of intimidation coupled with

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:84%
the fact that these reports
are described as being,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:90%
more often than not, silent.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So you have a large object--
the size of a football field

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:84%
is a typical description--
completely silent hovering

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
500 to 1,000 feet
above your head.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Regardless if it's
extraterrestrial or military,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
something that large
hovering over your head

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.911 align:middle line:84%
not making a sound
conveys some intimidation.

00:09:12.911 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And I interviewed a
woman that had a sighting back

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:90%
in 2000.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And this was in
the Chicago area,

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and she had a sighting
with her husband.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And both of them came off
as straight-laced as anyone

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:90%
you could possibly ever meet.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And as they're
describing the sighting,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I can see the non-verbal
body language.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I see her fidgeting.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I see her getting anxious.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:84%
You physically could see
her reliving the event.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, she
says, I get goosebumps

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
when I still talk
about it to this day.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the very nature of
these triangular UFO sightings,

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
relative to small flying
discs for example,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:90%
the reaction's quite different.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is it fair to ask
if you have any testimony

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:84%
of people who have been, A,
abducted or have gone on board

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
the triangular craft and
if there is a substantive

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
or qualitative difference
in the experience,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the ones explained
earlier by these gentleman

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:90%
wearing suits?

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Now in doing
my historical research,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:84%
as you can appreciate, most of
that was garnered from military

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
reports and newspaper articles,
which at the time, and which,

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
of course, we're talking '40s,
'50s, '60s, none of that was

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
ever referenced
in the newspaper.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.438 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, of course not.

00:10:27.438 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: So I like
to qualify that.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
As a result, the historical
evidence I uncovered

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any ties to
the abduction phenomenon.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Now that being said, since
talking about my research,

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:84%
since writing the
book, I have had

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
contacting me claiming

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
to have had abduction
experiences associated

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.056 align:middle line:90%
with these large triangular UFO.

00:10:47.056 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
talk about that.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.763 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Well, one of the
researchers that assisted me

00:10:50.763 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
in my research is Omar
Fowler from the UK.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.256 align:middle line:84%
And Omar had been investigating
these triangular UFOs

00:10:55.256 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.379 align:middle line:84%
He had been investing
the phenomenon

00:10:57.379 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:90%
in general for decades.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And he has a number-- I
believe he quotes one or two

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
cases in my book in the
section that he contributed--

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
from his files of
an abduction account

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:90%
involving these triangular UFOs.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And to your point, it's
definitely a marked difference

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:84%
compared to the space brother
narratives that we were hearing

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:84%
back in the '50s, with regard
to the contactee movement.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: It's a very dark
departure, you might say,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
from the messages and the
general overtones of those

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:90%
early encounters.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Any details at all
embedded in that somewhere?

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Insofar as--?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.127 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What the
experience was like.

00:11:38.127 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: With the
space brothers or the--?

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, no.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: With the abductions.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, first and
foremost, I think,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.170 align:middle line:84%
you have on its very
nature the experience

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:90%
in how it's introduced.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, with
the space brothers,

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:84%
they usually just
didn't suddenly appear

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:90%
and it scared the witness.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.085 align:middle line:90%
They would communicate.

00:11:57.085 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
There would be some type of
telepathic communication,

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:90%
in most instances.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course there were
variations in the reports,

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part
there was some type

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
of psychic communication,
telepathic communication.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The individual
would be instructed

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:90%
to go to a certain location.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly this
beautiful spaceship

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
would manifest itself, this
beautiful flying saucer

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.395 align:middle line:90%
and would slowly set down.

00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the door would open,
and a being would come out,

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.353 align:middle line:84%
and they would
converse, or they would

00:12:25.353 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:84%
have the individual
come on board.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.862 align:middle line:84%
So from a mental
processing standpoint--

00:12:29.862 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a
little more graceful.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: It's more graceful.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're taking
it in baby steps.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And so anyone,
I think, whether you or I,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
if we were in a similar
situation we could gradually

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.800 align:middle line:90%
acclimate to that situation.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.634 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like easing
into a hot bathtub.

00:12:43.634 --> 00:12:44.341 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: I'm slowly kind
of acclimating to this.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:90%
I can deal with this.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Whereas with the
abduction accounts,

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:84%
it's quite different,
quite contrary to that,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that many of
these abduction accounts

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.770 align:middle line:84%
occur in the middle
of the night.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.991 align:middle line:84%
And as I like to mention,
there are some people

00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:04.365 align:middle line:84%
that casually will talk about
their abduction experience,

00:13:04.365 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost like
a badge of honor.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And as an investigator,
I question

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.785 align:middle line:90%
the veracity of many claims.

00:13:10.785 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And as I've often
communicated to my colleagues

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.377 align:middle line:84%
in the field, if I was abducted,
if you came into my bedroom

00:13:18.377 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night
and were standing at the foot

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.902 align:middle line:84%
of my bed, I'm probably
going to scream--

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.431 align:middle line:90%
Like a girl.

00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: --let alone if you're
a little bald-headed little

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
standing next to my bed.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And what I find with
some of the abduction

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
accounts is the casual
blase way that they

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
explain how suddenly
these beings were

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
at the foot of their bed and
they were taken aboard a craft.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
What I find much more
compelling are the people,

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned earlier, where
you see the non-verbal body

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:84%
You see the fidgeting,
the twitching.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
respiration changing

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
as they start to describe
and relive these incidents.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
has the hallmarks

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.332 align:middle line:90%
of a genuine traumatic event.

00:13:57.332 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, admittedly, some people
have had repeated experiences,

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and they say over time
I've acclimated to it.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.839 align:middle line:90%
I've come to grips with it.

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:84%
John Mack even alludes to
that in some of his research,

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that initially it was viewed
as something negative,

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
but over time they may still
view it in a negative way

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
but they at least have been
able to in a healthy way

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:90%
incorporate it into their lives.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But the nature of the UFO
experience and the abduction

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.680 align:middle line:84%
experience, it's not
like the early contactees

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.555 align:middle line:84%
where they had time to
mentally process it.

00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Has any of
it been affiliated with

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:84%
the triangular-shaped
craft, these abductions?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: The abductions, yes.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned,
I've been contacted

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.209 align:middle line:84%
since my book's
publication by people.

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And ironically enough, that's
one of the number one questions

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.439 align:middle line:84%
I get asked when I do
interviews and lectures.

00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:90%
What about the abduction?

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.396 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any abduction
accounts tied to it?

00:14:45.396 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And again, I
qualify it by saying

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.431 align:middle line:84%
the book is based on
historical reports, which

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:90%
is not going to touch on that.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.471 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
find that in newspapers

00:14:52.471 --> 00:14:54.827 align:middle line:90%
of the 1940s and 1950s.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you're a very
careful researcher, and I

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.506 align:middle line:90%
understand that.

00:14:57.506 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Yes.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're
departing from that.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: That's not to say
that that activity was not

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.340 align:middle line:90%
going on then.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: But I can only
speak to what I've been able

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:90%
to document.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now talking with
Timothy Good, or Tim Good--

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Sure.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --he also talks
about this division somehow

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
in the agendas.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's fair to
say, because the triangular

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:84%
craft were witnessed as early
as the late 1800s, right?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Based on my research,
that's the earliest account

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that I can find, and, of course,
then subsequent sightings after

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.275 align:middle line:84%
that in the late 19th
and early 20th century.

00:15:34.275 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
so first of all,

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that takes the military
implication away.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have flight then.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: That's kind of my
thought on the matter, yeah.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that just kind of
blows it out of the water.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:42.775 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:90%
It blows it out of the water.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.856 align:middle line:84%
But what it's sounding like--
and it's almost naive to say

00:15:48.856 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:84%
this, because you would
say, well, sure, why not?--

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
that there have been these
conflicting agendas with beings

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:84%
from various parts of
the cosmos all along.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And that's
a distinct possibility.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Because people question.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:90%
We had flying saucers.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Now you're talking
about triangular UFOs.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Triangular UFOs have surpassed
the classic flying saucers

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:84%
in reports, based on the
statistics that I've looked at.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And also so
have the negative reports,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.295 align:middle line:84%
in terms of abductions
and contact.

00:16:15.295 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Yes.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.666 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's become
increasingly dark.

00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Yes.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now when I
was speaking with one

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:84%
of your colleagues yesterday,
they were mentioning that,

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:84%
in fact, some of our astronauts
and people in air forces around

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
the world, the more
elite team members,

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
were given technology by some
of the alien species to actually

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:90%
utilize.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Sure.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it was
telepathically communicated

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:90%
You may need a leg up.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.104 align:middle line:84%
You may need a leg up now,
because there are others here

00:16:49.104 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that may not have your
best interest at heart.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: I was just going
to say, for what reason?

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:90%
For what purpose?

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I was
going to go with that.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Is it suggestive of--

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Please.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.095 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Well, no, that's
what I was just going to ask.

00:17:00.095 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we need
a leg up for what?

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.791 align:middle line:84%
That implies that we need
a leg up for something,

00:17:03.791 --> 00:17:05.375 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
prepare for something.

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And it's quite
possible we're dealing with--

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.723 align:middle line:84%
and I think that that's part
of the complexity of trying

00:17:10.723 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to understand the UFO
phenomenon is many researchers,

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.099 align:middle line:84%
and I've been guilty of this
myself in the earlier days,

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to put everything,
every aspect of this

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.559 align:middle line:90%
investigation into one box.

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No can do.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And I think
what we're dealing with,

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:84%
if I can use the analogy, it's
like sitting a five-year-old

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
child down and messing with
their head by taking four

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
different puzzles but putting
it in one box and saying,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:90%
here you go.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Put this puzzle together.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's what we're--

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good point.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.693 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: --dealing with.

00:17:38.693 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And to your point, we may be
dealing with intelligences,

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:90%
plural, and agendas, plural.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And that just makes it damn hard
for UFO researchers like myself

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
to try to resolve all of these
anomalous experiences and cases

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make
sense out of it all.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:84%
But I really do
suspect that we're

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:84%
dealing with multiple
agendas and potentially

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:90%
multiple intelligences.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that
actually make sense.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the history and you

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
look at each person
that presents here,

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.999 align:middle line:84%
that's how you end up with
a divided community, one.

00:18:12.999 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:90%
It should not be divided.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: No.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.192 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because one says,
no, this is the experience

00:18:17.192 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:90%
that's happening.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not all like Val Thor,
Stranger at the Pentagon,

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:90%
in a beautiful navy blue suit.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
There's some creepy
little guys that we

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be with
that took us on-board.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.477 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:18:28.477 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then you have the
community that sits somewhere

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:36.170 align:middle line:84%
in between that says, yes, but
if we can just embrace a larger

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
agenda, perhaps, a cosmic type
of agenda and understand that

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.110 align:middle line:84%
the little guys that seem
to be coming and hybridizing

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and working with the human seed
to revitalize their own race

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
are doing nothing any different
than we might do if we were

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.452 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of state
of decline ourselves.

00:18:55.452 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Well, and obviously
it's hard to speculate about

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:90%
alien intelligences.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:10%
By their very definition,
they're alien.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:10%
>> MARLER: We don't
understand how they think,

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:10%
their philosophies on life.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But if we are dealing with
multiple intelligences,

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I would suspect,
because I can only

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:15.720 align:middle line:84%
go based on human experience,
we're diverse as individuals.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:90%
As one species, we're diverse.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:90%
And we have the good.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:90%
We have the bad.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:90%
We have the ugly.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I think it's naive
to assume that we

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:84%
have an extraterrestrial
intelligence

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:84%
or intelligences
interacting with us

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and they all fall
under one category.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:90%
They're all good.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:90%
They're all bad.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
complex diversity to it.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And nothing in
life is so simple.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.882 align:middle line:84%
I've actually had people
pose the idea, getting

00:19:39.882 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:84%
back to what you were
talking about about

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
flying saucers versus
triangles, oh, the grays

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:84%
fly the triangles,
and they're evil,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and the space brothers
fly the flying saucers,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and they have our best
interests at heart.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:84%
To me, from a
visceral standpoint,

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.475 align:middle line:90%
it just sounds too simplistic.

00:19:59.475 --> 00:20:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Yes.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That sounds
like you're trying to talk

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to a child about the
basics of good and evil.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.789 align:middle line:84%
And what else in life
is that simplistic?

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:08.746 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:20:08.746 --> 00:20:11.192 align:middle line:84%
Because, again-- even though
that's kind of where I was

00:20:11.192 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:84%
headed in this
conversation, just to say,

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:84%
have there been qualitative
differences in the experience

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:84%
connected with the shape of
craft?-- on the other hand,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.034 align:middle line:84%
even within those cultures,
again you have, as you say,

00:20:22.034 --> 00:20:23.200 align:middle line:90%
the good, bad, and the evil.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.116 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:20:24.116 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What if you have a
culture that maybe may not have

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:84%
the level of what we recognize
as human compassion but they

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:84%
see in a larger sense that you
on some level subconsciously

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
or on a soul level have
agreed to do this with us?

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry you don't remember.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.627 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
that camp as well.

00:20:40.627 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And even within
human politics-- again,

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I can only use humans as kind
of a point of comparison--

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
you have the political
party, whichever one you tend

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
to choose, that
has their agenda.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But as we all know, there's
individual politicians

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
that are following that agenda
that have their own agendas.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: I don't think that it
needs to be quite so simplistic

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
that there's this alien and this
is their philosophy and this is

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:90%
why they're here.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a complex
situation we're dealing with,

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.909 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think we can
put it into a simple box.

00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And you would hear that--
looking at disclosure,

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:84%
for example, I was at the
original disclosure in-- what

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:90%
was it?-- May of 2001 or '02.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: 2001.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 2001.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
In Washington DC,
National Press Club.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I was privy behind
the scenes with Greer's group

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:84%
to speaking with virtually
all of the witnesses

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and watching what
they went through.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And their experience was as
diverse as this conversation

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.230 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
they encountered,

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
from Clifford Stone
to a little ET who

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.912 align:middle line:84%
was frightened and trying
to communicate with him.

00:21:49.912 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Right.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.435 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have feelings
too, and I'm frightened.

00:21:52.435 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Right.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.448 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:21:53.448 --> 00:21:56.074 align:middle line:84%
And Clifford has teared up every
time he even speaks about it--

00:21:56.074 --> 00:21:57.156 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Oh, absolutely.

00:21:57.156 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --to the appearance
of the ET over the military

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.325 align:middle line:84%
base with the silos,
with the nuclear silos--

00:22:04.325 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Malmstrom.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --saying, people,
we're not going to let you do

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: That's right.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're not
using these irresponsibly.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: That's right.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's intimidating,
but toward what end, right?

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: What's
the ultimate goal?

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
the ultimate goal?

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Exactly.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
A child thinks that a parent's
bad when they get spanked.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.070 align:middle line:84%
But as we know, it's for
the child's own good,

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:90%
in most cases.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Or the child doesn't
like the doctor

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.942 align:middle line:84%
because he sticks a needle
in my arm and that hurts.

00:22:25.942 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: But we know that
the doctor's interest is

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:90%
for the greater good.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, the original
disclosure, the testimony--

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:84%
for anybody that hasn't
seen that, it's on YouTube--

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:36.536 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Everyone
needs to see this.

00:22:36.536 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --is
absolutely amazing.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Everyone
needs to see this.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That was a
profound event in history.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.566 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: I have a psychology
professor that's a personal

00:22:42.566 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:84%
friend of mine, and he's very
interested in the UFO subject,

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.624 align:middle line:84%
and he always goes back to
that disclosure project.

00:22:48.624 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it
was interesting,

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:90%
because the room was packed.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.976 align:middle line:84%
And of course, on American
media, there was one,

00:22:53.976 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I think a local Washington,
DC ABC affiliate

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.656 align:middle line:90%
did a little report.

00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
made fun of it.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Yeah, of course.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the room was
packed with media from all over

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
the world, and the
US heard nothing.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: You simply cannot
ignore the testimony of these

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.227 align:middle line:84%
men and women based
on their credentials.

00:23:11.227 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Right down to the
structures on the moon

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:84%
that are scrubbed out at
the photographic department

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:84%
of NASA, and her job
was to scrub the photos.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Anything that looked
anomalous was to be scrubbed.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And what's
interesting is--

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Karl Wolf.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.879 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: --even with
these individuals telling

00:23:26.879 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:84%
their individual testimony,
there are certain parallels.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're not
telling the same story,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.712 align:middle line:84%
you can see that it's following
a similar agenda, based

00:23:37.712 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:84%
on what they had observed during
their time in the military

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:84%
or during their tenure involving
intelligence communities.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's all pointing
to one agenda,

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's namely keeping the
information from the public,

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.580 align:middle line:90%
downplaying the information.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's become
readily apparent based

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.640 align:middle line:84%
on anyone that's taken even a
cursory examination of the UFO

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.840 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What do you have
to say about the split within

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.000 align:middle line:90%
the community?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Because the community's
always badmouthing each other

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and competing with one
another, saying their ETs

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.100 align:middle line:84%
are the only ones that
actually are impacting us.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.734 align:middle line:90%
They say, no, our ETs are.

00:24:17.734 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's so immature.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
How do you expect people
behaving in this way

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:90%
to take a movement forward?

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And then there are people like
the ones I've spoken with,

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:84%
like you and Timothy Good and
Glenn Steckling and others,

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:84%
who are really staying
with the bodies of research

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:90%
and trying to bridge these gaps.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I mention in my book one
of the biggest problems

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.436 align:middle line:84%
we have with this field are
the UFO believers themselves.

00:24:43.436 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:90%
We badmouth the government.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.268 align:middle line:84%
We say the government's
covering this up.

00:24:46.268 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
The government's
suppressing information.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Just in my 23 years of active
investigation in this field,

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I've seen more damage
done by the UFO community

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
to itself, self-inflicted
gunshot wound,

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
as I like to call it, as opposed
to anything that I've ever

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:84%
been able to
substantially document

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.715 align:middle line:90%
that the government has done.

00:25:04.715 --> 00:25:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Certainly the government
downplays the information.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But to your point,
there's competing agendas.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:84%
People have certain agendas
with regard to this.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.130 align:middle line:90%
There's certain egos.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And as I like to
say, the phenomenon

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:90%
revolves around no one ego.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
We revolve around
the phenomenon.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not the other way around.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And as a community, we need
to be able to disagree but not

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:84%
be disagreeable
with one another.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the day, it doesn't

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.212 align:middle line:84%
matter what David
Marler believes.

00:25:33.212 --> 00:25:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter with
this researcher believes

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:90%
or that believes.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.801 align:middle line:90%
What does the evidence show?

00:25:38.801 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
why I try to stick

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.100 align:middle line:84%
with documentable,
verifiable evidence.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Let the information
take you to where

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.400 align:middle line:84%
it leads, whether
you like it or not.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, what's it going
to take to have a mature voice

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:84%
at these conferences to
bridge all of that now?

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: The problem
is, in my opinion,

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon itself
have no parameters.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:90%


00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
As you mentioned, there's all
of these different aspects

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.940 align:middle line:84%
to the phenomenon,
so we can't even

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:90%
quantify what the phenomenon is.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
someone coming in

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and they say that
they're the reincarnation

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:84%
of an alien entity from the
planet Kobol or whatever,

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
can you really
discount this person?

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.694 align:middle line:84%
Because where is the
benchmark for crazy

00:26:31.694 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
when you have people saying that
they have bald-headed creatures

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.470 align:middle line:84%
coming into their bedroom
and abducting them?

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So there are no parameters
to the phenomenon

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.800 align:middle line:84%
that we can clearly
define, which

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that creates an atmosphere
where everything kind of gets

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.682 align:middle line:90%
poured into this mix.

00:26:48.682 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And it's
just very difficult,

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:84%
because at the end of the day,
65-plus years of investigation,

00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
we still really don't know
what we're dealing with.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.175 align:middle line:84%
But just because
we can't identify

00:27:02.175 --> 00:27:03.360 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't mean it's there.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you
have little pixels--

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: We do.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --many pixels.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to create
a larger portrait.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.974 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And I think we
need to take a step back,

00:27:09.974 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:90%
to go with that analogy.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Take the step back and
look at the big picture,

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly those
little individual pixels

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.565 align:middle line:90%
start to paint a picture.

00:27:18.565 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And that's
a good analogy.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, now one of the
specifics you talked about that

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.963 align:middle line:84%
I found interesting-- and I
think I found it interesting

00:27:24.963 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:84%
because of the startling
image I saw in Jaime

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Maussan's presentation
yesterday, which wasn't a UFO,

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:38.301 align:middle line:84%
It was this thing,
this being caught--

00:27:38.301 --> 00:27:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
saw his presentation--

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:40.966 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: I think I--

00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --caught in night
vision that was somehow taking

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:90%
energy from this swimming pool.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Oh, no,
that one I missed.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I saw most of his presentation.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm talking to Jaime
about this in a few weeks--

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: OK.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --aside from
all of the other things.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:90%
He has so much phenomenal video.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.433 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Oh, absolutely.

00:27:56.433 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I found it
really interesting.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:84%
It was massive,
this large thing.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:84%
It almost looked
like it had wings.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.420 align:middle line:84%
It was doing something
with its energy

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.855 align:middle line:84%
extending into or taking
energy from a swimming pool.

00:28:07.855 --> 00:28:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Hmm.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now you're saying
these triangular craft often

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.330 align:middle line:90%
appear above reservoirs.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: There's a lot of
sightings in and around water,

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:90%
not so much in but around water.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and then you
have the supposed phenomenon

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of underwater bases, which
have been witnessed by many,

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.124 align:middle line:84%
many people, with UFOs
rising out of the water.

00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the 1973 wave of
sightings I alluded to,

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.027 align:middle line:84%
the Piedmont sightings,
there's an area there which,

00:28:36.027 --> 00:28:38.610 align:middle line:84%
when I was a young boy, I used
to go fishing there with my dad

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It's called Clearwater
Lake and Clearwater Dam.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And back in '73, there was
two women driving in a car,

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.884 align:middle line:84%
and they were pulled
off to the side.

00:28:47.884 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And they reported seeing-- and
there were other witnesses,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.320 align:middle line:84%
by the way, as well
later that reported

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.580 align:middle line:84%
seeing the same thing-- lights
moving underwater in Clearwater

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Lake.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know one of
the primary areas

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.010 align:middle line:84%
in the world for these
sightings of USOs,

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:08.820 align:middle line:84%
they call them, Unidentified
Submerged Objects, is, I think,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.670 align:middle line:90%
the Channel Islands.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.241 align:middle line:84%
It's right off the coast of
Los Angeles near the Channel

00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Islands.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.990 align:middle line:84%
That's where most of it is
seen, a good amount of it.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.781 align:middle line:84%
There's supposed to be
a base of some kind.

00:29:16.781 --> 00:29:20.640 align:middle line:84%
But I guess the point being
something about what's

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.654 align:middle line:84%
happening between these
craft-- and you probably

00:29:22.654 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:90%
don't know the answer.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.935 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- what's
happening between these craft

00:29:25.935 --> 00:29:27.642 align:middle line:90%
and these bodies of water?

00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: That I don't know.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But as many people
have speculated,

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.280 align:middle line:84%
perhaps that's
where they're based,

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:84%
or that's where they're
originating from.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you think
that might have-- I see.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.473 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Considering the
volume of water on the planet

00:29:37.473 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:90%
relative to the surface area--

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:46.025 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And we can't go to
these ridiculously deep depths

00:29:46.025 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:90%
due to the pressures.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So if we can't go
there but they can,

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:84%
that's a great place to have
a base of operations, assuming

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:84%
that they exist in this
spatial, temporal realm

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that we exist in,
which, of course, is

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:90%
another area of speculation.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they don't
exist in this realm,

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.570 align:middle line:84%
but they're able to simply
slip in and then slip out.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, quite possibly.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, all
of the work you've

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.430 align:middle line:84%
done for all of
these years, A, what

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:84%
is it that you find the
most fascinating and hopeful

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.940 align:middle line:90%
in all of this?

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And what do you find
the most frustrating?

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
the one part we really

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
have to transcend before
any kind of merging

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.280 align:middle line:84%
with this technology or other
civilizations can happen?

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: I think
the biggest obstacle--

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.695 align:middle line:90%
let me start with the hope.

00:30:33.695 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: I think the thing
that instills hope with me is

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:84%
regardless of all our efforts
within the UFO community,

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:84%
as you know, every day someone
is having a UFO experience

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of the
disclosure that we all

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.990 align:middle line:84%
love to talk about by
our government leaders,

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:57.150 align:middle line:84%
every day someone's
life is changing

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.390 align:middle line:84%
with the sighting of an
unconventional aerial object.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And so slowly each
individual in our society

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.626 align:middle line:84%
is waking up to a larger
reality that UFOs are real.

00:31:09.626 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
how I times I've

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.020 align:middle line:84%
interviewed law enforcement
officers over the years that

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:84%
told me if you would have come
in here a year ago telling me

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.160 align:middle line:84%
you investigated UFOs, I would
have told you there's the door.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But I know what I saw, and I
can't deny that stuff anymore.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And every day someone's having
an experience like that.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So the scale in our
favor is turning,

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.590 align:middle line:84%
whether the governments of
the world like it or not.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.910 align:middle line:84%
As the citizenry continues
to experience these things,

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.620 align:middle line:84%
more people are waking
up to a greater reality,

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what we
do in the UFO field.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.030 align:middle line:90%
It's just happening.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just occurring.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what's
the greatest frustration?

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: The frustration
I have is that I think we,

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:84%
as researchers, need to
define, myself included,

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.330 align:middle line:84%
what we know versus
what we believe.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.670 align:middle line:90%
And there's a huge gap.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And quite often you'll
find researchers

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.370 align:middle line:84%
that do sloppy work, that
are stating what they know.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.780 align:middle line:84%
When you parse the data
and you look at it,

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:84%
it's like we really
can't say we know that.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's arguments
similar, unfortunately,

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.695 align:middle line:84%
to people that are
of a religious bent.

00:32:12.695 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Very true.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:16.023 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: They'll say, well,
I know God is here for me,

00:32:16.023 --> 00:32:16.947 align:middle line:90%
and I know this.

00:32:16.947 --> 00:32:18.280 align:middle line:90%
And I would try to correct them.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
you believe that.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.130 align:middle line:90%
I said, religion is faith-based.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Faith is based on belief
in the absence of fact.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I
respect you for that.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.727 align:middle line:84%
But I said, you
can't say you know.

00:32:28.727 --> 00:32:29.550 align:middle line:90%
You believe it.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, I know.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.480 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we see
parallels in the UFO community

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:34.750 align:middle line:90%
with regard to that.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.750 align:middle line:84%
People say, I know why
the aliens are here.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:38.986 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe you do.

00:32:38.986 --> 00:32:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've had an
on-board experience

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.947 align:middle line:90%
that I'm just not privy to.

00:32:41.947 --> 00:32:44.530 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of researchers
and a lot of people out there

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:48.660 align:middle line:84%
that casually will throw
that word out there, I know.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you say you
know, you better

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:90%
have something to back it up.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So interestingly,
when we look at disclosure,

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.620 align:middle line:84%
let's have disclosure, the
drums have been beating

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.210 align:middle line:84%
for disclosure, public
disclosure on behalf

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of the military and
governments of the world,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:90%
which has been withheld.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.681 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
the argument for that--

00:33:08.681 --> 00:33:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and we've heard the various
stages through the decades

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:84%
of what is likely to have
been the argument on behalf

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.100 align:middle line:84%
of the superiors in the military
and so forth and is the public

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
ready for it?-- well,
considering just this

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
conversation, considering the
fact that there are likely

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:84%
multiple intelligences
coming in multiple varieties

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:34.010 align:middle line:84%
of spacecraft for a multiple
variety of agendas and reasons,

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.840 align:middle line:84%
is humanity ready to take
this whole thing on when

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.230 align:middle line:84%
it's so overwhelmingly
complex and easy to exploit

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:84%
by the media, which they are
doing on the negative side?

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.033 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Well, in my book
I talk about the fact that I

00:33:46.033 --> 00:33:47.840 align:middle line:84%
sympathize with
governments of the world.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult
situation to be in.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:84%
They're charged
with the task of, A,

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:84%
protecting the citizenry,
first and foremost,

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and ensuring
domestic tranquility.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.990 align:middle line:84%
That's hard to do when you're
faced with intelligence

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.950 align:middle line:84%
or intelligences
that are superior

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:05.251 align:middle line:90%
by their very definition.

00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:06.000 align:middle line:90%
They can get here.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.090 align:middle line:90%
We can't get there.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So you're faced
with that situation.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.756 align:middle line:84%
But as I like to
point out, we always

00:34:12.756 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:84%
talk about government
conspiracy.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.730 align:middle line:84%
We always talk
about the cover-up

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:17.639 align:middle line:90%
when we talk about disclosure.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:20.010 align:middle line:84%
The point I like to make--
and I can't emphasize

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:26.110 align:middle line:84%
this enough-- the ultimate
architects of the UFO cover-up

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.250 align:middle line:84%
are the intelligences that
are operating these craft.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:31.820 align:middle line:84%
If they wanted to
come down en masse,

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:84%
clearly nobody is going
to be able to stop them

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:35.389 align:middle line:90%
from doing that.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:37.010 align:middle line:90%
But that's not in their agenda.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Clearly that's not
in their agenda.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.219 align:middle line:84%
So is the government
suppressing information?

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, based
on all evidence

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:44.670 align:middle line:84%
that's highly
suggestive of that.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate
architects of the cover-up

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.219 align:middle line:84%
are the extraterrestrials or
these entities themselves.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:51.110 align:middle line:90%
It's up to them.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:90%
They have the power.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.659 align:middle line:84%
They have the
technological superiority.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:84%
If they wanted to
come down en masse,

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.650 align:middle line:90%
they would be here right now.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But whatever their agenda, it
serves them to be more covert.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
a very good point.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.205 align:middle line:84%
If it could only be as easy as
"The Day the Earth Stood Still"

00:35:09.205 --> 00:35:10.374 align:middle line:90%
film, 1951 version.

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: One of the best
films ever made on the subject.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:13.914 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: One of the best.

00:35:13.914 --> 00:35:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Very simple, very
peaceful, profound message,

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.939 align:middle line:84%
kind of a monochromatic
message for all of humanity.

00:35:20.939 --> 00:35:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: And one that I
think still holds true today.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It does hold true.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: Because,
unfortunately,

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.120 align:middle line:84%
you look at our society today,
have we really changed that

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.247 align:middle line:90%
much?

00:35:28.247 --> 00:35:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.163 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Technology's changed.

00:35:30.163 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Technology's changed,
but the same greed,

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.950 align:middle line:84%
the same petty
differences that we

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.260 align:middle line:84%
have between countries,
religions, cultures,

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.600 align:middle line:90%
we're still dealing with that.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when
people say, why

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.750 align:middle line:84%
don't the aliens
come down and land?

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:45.455 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why
would they want to?

00:35:45.455 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing about UFOs.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.300 align:middle line:84%
We have to take the research
lens and turn it on ourselves.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Because really, at
the end of the day,

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.020 align:middle line:84%
if we are dealing with
a superior culture,

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:59.380 align:middle line:84%
where do we fall in relation
to that, in contrast to that?

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we
are a primitive society,

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:84%
relative to them,
that's still engaged

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:90%
in primitive tribal warfare.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.240 align:middle line:90%
We can try to dress it up.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:90%
We can put lipstick on a pig.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
we're still a primitive culture

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:84%
engaged in basic
tribal warfare that

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:22.190 align:middle line:84%
has refined the art of
killing to a fantastic degree.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MARLER: But at least we're
still here as a species--

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So the question is--

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: --so there's hope.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --what is our
responsibility in this contact?

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Absolutely.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I think our
responsibility first is

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to get
along with each other

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.120 align:middle line:84%
before we can
expect to get along

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.170 align:middle line:84%
with any type of
extraterrestrial or alien

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.260 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.882 align:middle line:10%
Until we can prove
that to them--

00:36:39.882 --> 00:36:41.340 align:middle line:10%
because I'm sure
they're monitoring

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.030 align:middle line:10%
our behavior, probably
for centuries--

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.950 align:middle line:10%
until we can demonstrate and
prove to them that we can get

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:10%
along as a species, why would
they want to deal with us?

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: On that
note, good point,

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.190 align:middle line:90%
and I thank you for your time.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLER: Thank you.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:15.067 align:middle line:90%
