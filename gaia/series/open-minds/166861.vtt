>>REGINA MEREDITH: Compton
Rom is with us again

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:10%
to talk about the
life-giving force of micros

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.730 align:middle line:10%
in the human body.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:10%
In this conversation,
we're going

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:10%
to pick up where we left
off in the last conversation

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:10%
and see what he's been up
to since we last spoke.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:90%
And I can say this.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.230 align:middle line:90%
It's really exciting.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I was so happy to be
talking to you on the phone

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:90%
to prep for this.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh my god.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:90%
You're on to something.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:90%
This is big.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we just tend to think
of them as creepy little

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.945 align:middle line:84%
critters that we're in
battle with on some level.

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's not your world view.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.425 align:middle line:84%
So just to maybe encapsulate the
last conversation a little bit

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and what you
brought to the table

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.913 align:middle line:84%
there before we launch into
this one, that'd be great.

00:01:05.913 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:10%
>>COMPTON ROM: Well, Regina,
the last conversation,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:10%
we talked about the
importance of the microbiome

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:10%
and probiotics in the body.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:10%
And this happened a few
years ago before the crazes

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:10%
with probiotics and kombucha.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And now, one of the
biggest things in medicine

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.320 align:middle line:84%
is microbiome therapeutics
and whether treating people

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
with new types of microbes
to combat disease.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And my feeling was
that back then, I

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:84%
knew that the longest
living people in the world

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:84%
usually had the
healthiest microbes.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And fecal matter transplants
were just getting started.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And you transfer microbes from
healthy people to sick people,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:90%
and the sick people get healthy.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And you transfer
microbes from sick people

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and you give them
to healthy people,

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:90%
and the healthy people get sick.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.754 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they actually
do that in reverse in studies?

00:02:02.754 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Has it ever been done?

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Where you would take
unhealthy fecal matter

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.910 align:middle line:90%
and put into a healthy person?

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: No, but
you have kids that

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
are proven to go into McDonald's
in like the plastic balls,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and they get sick
because they're basically

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
eating the fecal matter on
these balls from other children.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you can just kind of
imagine what that's like.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in
theory, obviously, yes.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, so I went
in search with the fact

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that if healthy people have
the healthiest microbiomes,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to look for the
healthiest people in the world.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:10%
And so for the last
six years, we've

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:10%
been on a worldwide quest to
visit all the longevity zones

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:10%
in the world--

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:10%
what are called blue zones by
Dan Buettner and cold spots,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:10%
where there's low
incidence of disease--

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:10%
for example Copper
Canyon in Mexico,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:10%
where they absolutely have a
very low incidence of diabetes

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:10%
in Northern India in the Punjab.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Punjab, yes.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: Where they have very
low incidence of Alzheimer's

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.529 align:middle line:10%
and very low incidence
of Parkinson's there.

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
interesting-- in Punjab,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.809 align:middle line:84%
we were just talking in another
conversation about rice,

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and grains, and everything in
Alzheimer's-- and Punjab is one

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest producers
of rice in the world,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:90%
but that's obviously not it.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were telling
us some of the other zones

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.154 align:middle line:90%
before I interrupted.

00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: Well, there's a
zone in Costa Rica, Nosara,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:10%
but I've been focusing
on this zone in Greece

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:10%
in an island called Ikaria.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:10%
And we've been working
with an organic winery

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.900 align:middle line:10%
there, Afianes
Winery, and working

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:10%
with the resident
microbiologist,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:10%
and he's a professor emeritus
at the University of Athens.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's also looking
at the microbiome,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and he found some
very unique microbes

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
on the grapes in Greece, and
specifically on that island

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
that gives people the ability
to basically live a long life.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.445 align:middle line:84%
And over 30% of the population
are over 90 years old and--

00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:08.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, and when you're
talking to these people,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:84%
they don't even talk
about their age.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So their mindset is
not even about aging.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not longevity.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have access to
these supplements that we have.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
access to Whole Foods.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't have access to GNC.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:90%
They're just living their lives.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're drinking the
right kinds of water--

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they drink
wine by and large?

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.545 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is that
a part of their--

00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:40.355 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They drink a lot of
wine, yeah, like, every week.

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:42.392 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How many
glasses a day average?

00:04:42.392 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you know there's
been a lot on the news

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
lately about what is
considered binge drinking,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:84%
because our binge drinking
numbers in the US are going up.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: They are, yeah.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I couldn't tell
you how many glasses of wine

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:90%
they drink.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly
enough is, they don't

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:90%
focus on how the wine tastes.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:90%
They just like drinking wine.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of the wines that
they drink is very vinegary.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well,
this comes into the story.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So we started
looking, and I started

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:90%
talking to this microbiologist.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.497 align:middle line:84%
And we started noticing that
perhaps it isn't just the food

00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:90%
that they're eating.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:84%
It may be the microbes are
having some sort of effect.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, we started
doing microbiome studies

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
on people on this island and
especially the older people.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Their microbiomes are vastly
different from the people that

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
had lived on the island that
have left the islands that are

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:90%
living in Athens, for example.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:90%
So they have a--

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
by DNA analysis,
their microbiomes

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
are vastly different because
the foods they're eating

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.385 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But when they came back on the
island to eat the same foods,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and to drink the same wines,
and to drink the same vinegars

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:84%
on their food, their microbiomes
changed-- the younger people.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: And presumably,
their health status

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:90%
would change as well.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So we started on this quest to
say, look, maybe it's not just

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:84%
the food, and maybe it's
not just the supplements,

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it's not just the
lifestyle that they're eating--

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the microbes have a
stake in the body's whole being

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:90%
and whole wellness.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's not
just the microbes.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:84%
It's the way that
they're processing

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:90%
the foods inside their body.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So our labs in Utah,
we've been discovering

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:84%
like a whole new
class of compounds.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And these compounds allow
the body to make metabolites

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:90%
like vitamins--

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
like lipopolysaccharides,
like single proteins

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that allow the body to
basically face life and face

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
all of its challenges
head on, you know?

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've noticed about
Western medicine as it is now

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:90%
is we're very reactive.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:08.345 align:middle line:90%
too are diseases.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.145 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: We don't do anything
until the disease happens,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:90%
and we become reactive.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So we get atherosclerosis,
let's do something about it.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
We get diabetes, now let's
do something about it.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:90%
And so we're reactive.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But in our lifestyles, in
our athletes, in our studies,

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:90%
we're very proactive.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:84%
The best football
teams, for example,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:90%
are the offensive machines.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that go
out there and assemble

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
the best minds and the
best assets to go out

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and score a bunch
of points, right?

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And in our military,
obviously, we

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
arm soldiers with the best
tools and the best assets

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
to go out and, unfortunately,
annihilate the enemy

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:90%
with overwhelming force.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: Why don't we do
that with our bodies?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we
amass these tools

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and give the microbes
the things that we

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
need to allow them
to amass our bodies

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
with overwhelming healthy assets
to live a healthy lifestyle?

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And instead, what
we're seeing right now

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:84%
is going to a dinner party
or putting on a dinner party

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:90%
now for a variety of people.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.460 align:middle line:84%
The first question comes up is,
so what are you allergic to?

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And here, you have
one person can't eat this.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:90%
Another person can't eat gluten.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Another person can't eat fats.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.513 align:middle line:84%
It's really shocking when you
think of even 10 years ago,

00:08:38.513 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:84%
you'd go and you'd kind
of get along and maybe

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:84%
one person there couldn't
digest something.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, it seems as
almost everybody

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.335 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of allergic
reaction to normal foods.

00:08:47.335 --> 00:08:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that
it's part physiological.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of it is mindset.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And I believe a lot
of it is emotional.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And just because we have
permission now to be allergic--

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
before, I wasn't
allergic to gluten.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And oh, I can be
allergic to gluten now?

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Great!

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm gluten intolerant.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.222 align:middle line:90%
So I'll make that--

00:09:10.222 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
also can be masking

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of stuff
going on in the guts

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:90%
in a dysfunctional manner.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Exactly.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there is that emotional,
psychological mindset,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
but there is actually a
physiological component.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it
is because we may

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
lack the genetic
predisposition to make

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.610 align:middle line:84%
the proper human enzymes
to break down these things.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it is, we don't
have the proper microbes

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
in our body to make the
proper enzymes to break down

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:84%
the foodstuffs that
we're allergic to.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the microbes
are simply a function

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:90%
of diet for the most part?

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: For the most part, it's
a function of our environment,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about diet,
we talk about nutrition.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk
about nutrition, I'm

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
talking nutrition on the
most basic levels, you know?

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm a
microbiologist, I believe

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
that the microbes--
that the human body

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
is actually an extension
of the microbial life

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:90%
and the microbial body.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.074 align:middle line:90%
We're just their extension.

00:10:12.074 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
They've been here for
millions of years.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
We've only been here for
a fraction of that time,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and they're using us as
their stage to live a million

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:90%
more years.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
very intelligent.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:32.788 align:middle line:84%
And if we recognize
that fact that we have--

00:10:32.788 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
how many cells does
the human body have?

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Like over 100 trillion?

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's proven now that
90% of that 100 trillion

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:84%
are microbes, and only
10% are human cells.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And the majority of those
microbes live in our gut.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.357 align:middle line:84%
And they're all like
little computers.

00:10:51.357 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And they want this body to live.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:90%
They have a stake.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:84%
They're the biggest
stakeholder in our body.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:90%
We are not.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Aetna and our health plans are
not the biggest stakeholders.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are we their
host or are they our host?

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:90%
We are their host.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
If you think that
way, then you'll

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
start to create a paradigm
shift in your body.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So I've come up
with this new way

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about the
microbes in our gut, which

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
we call our gastrointestinal
tract or our GI tract.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And frequently when
we relabel things,

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:84%
we tend to subconsciously think
differently about those things.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would like to
think as the microbes

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
as our little
computers in our gut.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones
making all of our vitamins.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
The only reason why we have
to take b-12 exogenously

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:84%
is because we don't
make enough in our gut.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.596 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of microbes
that make b-12 in our gut.

00:11:52.596 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
If we packed more of these
microbes that made b-12,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:90%
we don't have to take b-12.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can be vegan, and
plant-based all you want.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:84%
You just have to have
the proper microbes.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:90%
You just need to arm them.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
the intelligence,

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and they have the will to make
our lives a limitless life.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So these are intelligent little
computers living in our gut,

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can sense that our gut
is like one big condominium

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
complex of like 90
trillion organisms.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're like
biological computers,

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and they have an
intelligence behind them.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our gut is
called our second brain.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we have like a
mental intelligence,

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:84%
we have emotional intelligence,
and great athletes

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
have what's called kinesthetic
intelligence-- you know,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
like Michael Jordan has amazing
kinesthetic intelligence.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And now with our iPhones,
and our computers

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:84%
with Google and the Cloud, we
have artificial intelligence.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.541 align:middle line:90%
So we have the AI.

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.089 align:middle line:90%
We have knowledge intelligence.

00:12:58.089 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:90%
We have emotional intelligence.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:90%
We even have heart intelligence.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But no one ever talks about
biological intelligence--

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence that's housed
in our gut, our second brain.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it balances out all the
other intelligence, especially

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
the AI-- the technological
intelligence.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, the more I see my
child playing with my phone--

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:90%
she's only 2 and 1/2 years old.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:84%
She already knows
how to use the mouse,

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and she hardly knows how to
use her little iPad to transfer

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:90%
some of her brain function.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:90%
It's like astounding to me.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to take
this away from her,

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:90%
but we need to balance it out.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
We need to balance out the
technological information

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and our dependence on
artificial intelligence

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:90%
with biological intelligence.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Because this is native,
wild-crafted intelligence

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:90%
that's coming from the earth.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.563 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's interesting
because your background--

00:13:52.563 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
you're one of these
people that is--

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I think you have an
unusually high form

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.780 align:middle line:84%
of broad-based
intelligence, shall we say?

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Whenever anybody that
knows you speaks of you,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
you're exemplary in your
ability to grok concepts

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:84%
across the board--
technologically, biologically,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:90%
and everything in between.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And part of your
background was in--

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:84%
as an architect, even
in the very early days

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:84%
of Google, and starting
to create these systems

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.375 align:middle line:90%
of artificial intelligence.

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you know of what
you speak when you say this.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.517 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting you should
say, when it comes down to it,

00:14:27.517 --> 00:14:30.100 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to get that device
away from our little daughter,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.920 align:middle line:84%
so she retains her organic,
native intelligence.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Exactly.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm all for
wild crafting back

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
into nature and through our
biological intelligence.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'm up for nominating
to changing the GI

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.063 align:middle line:90%
tract into our BI tract--

00:14:47.063 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:84%
our biological
intelligence tract.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:49.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it!

00:14:49.785 --> 00:14:51.868 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's start on the
components of this story,

00:14:51.868 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
start with something--

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:90%
fermentation.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
We think of fermentation
like wine and beer,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.839 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the sugars
in our body, et cetera.

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
fermentation then

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:84%
roll right into the story
of super fermentation.

>>ROM: Right.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So every time we eat food,
we, as a human body--

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:90%
we don't actually eat the food.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that eats it
are the microbes in our body.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.300 align:middle line:84%
We eat the
fermentation products.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
We actually eat
the waste products

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:84%
from 10 layers of microbes
that are in our gut.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the human gut is
so populated with living

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
organisms, it is the most
populated place on Earth

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:90%
with living organisms.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more
populated than the human gut.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when we poo,
what's going out of our body?

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: When we poo, what's
going out of our body

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:84%
is the actual waste products
that the body doesn't

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.000 align:middle line:90%
need plus a lot of microbes.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So our bodies has
extracted all the waste

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So once we get food
into our stomach

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and it enters the beginning
parts of our small intestine,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
where there's a
lot of oxygen, it

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
gets broken down
by those bacteria

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
in what's called the
proximal small intestine.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when they break it
down into primary metabolites,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:84%
basically, their waste
product, then there's

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
a second set of microbes that
take it and break it down

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:90%
into metabolites.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And these metabolites get
sifted out of the intestine

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.480 align:middle line:90%
into our body.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what we eat for food.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:10%
So we're eating
primary metabolites,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:10%
secondary metabolites,
tertiary metabolites,

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:10%
quaternary metabolites.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:10%
And as this food
goes through our gut,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:10%
we're finding out that
it's being fermented

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:10%
in like this cascading
super fermentation, where

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of microbes are
going at it sequentially,

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:10%
in parallel, they're just
going at it at one time.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're eating
the actual food.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:84%
They're eating the byproducts of
the microbes that have already

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:90%
eaten that food.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're changing
these components

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
into recognizable
metabolites that we

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
can measure in our urine,
we can measure in our blood.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Right now, these
metabolites, for example,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.760 align:middle line:84%
are small-chain fatty acids--
are probably the most popular

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
metabolites that science
is recognizing right now--

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:90%
SCFA-- small-chain fatty acids.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:84%
The most recognizable
are three--

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:84%
butyric acid, propionic
acid, and acetic acid.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But there are smaller ones
called oxaloacetic acid,

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:90%
pyruvate, and malic acid.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And they make up the
acids that are actually

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
the food for the main
bacteria in our body

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that provides fuel for
every single cell called

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:90%
the mitochondria.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So I called the
mitochondria the main bacteria.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't think
of it as a bacteria,

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
but believe it or not,
it's got evolutionary genes

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that make it into-- it's
literally a bacteria.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
I have to back up.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I have a question.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.793 align:middle line:84%
So I'm listening to
what you're saying here.

00:17:59.793 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:10%
So by the time it's ready to
be eliminated from the body,

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:10%
it sounds like a lot of
the metabolite function

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:10%
has already happened.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The various microbes and such
have been utilized and fed us

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:90%
in certain ways.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.613 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that mean that the
final product that leaves us

00:18:15.613 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:84%
somewhat diminished
and yet that is

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
what's used in the fecal
transplants, for example.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.790 align:middle line:84%
What's left in that that is
useful to be used to help

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:90%
increase the health of others.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:84%
but I would be surprised if
the fecal matter was not--

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
if the fecal matter had maybe
even 70% of the nutrients

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.360 align:middle line:84%
that came that started
at the beginning.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.131 align:middle line:90%

>>ROM: Mother deer--
the first time

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:84%
that they get their babies,
the first thing that they do

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is they feed fecal
matter to their babies.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.849 align:middle line:84%
That's why deer only
have like two progeny,

00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
enough fecal matter

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:90%
to feed three or four.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:84%
The third one that comes
out, they usually die.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:84%
All the rabbits, and Guinea
pigs, and things like that--

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.290 align:middle line:84%
they feed their
young fecal matter.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's very nutritious.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.750 align:middle line:90%
We give it to our plants.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very nutritious.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Biodynamic,
biointensive gardening

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:90%
relies on it.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So fecal
matter is something

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't smell good
to us, so we naturally

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:84%
like stay away from it, but
it's actually very nutritious.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now going
into super fermentation,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.445 align:middle line:84%
and what are the effects
of this in the body?

00:19:52.445 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, the effects
of super fermentation

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:01.720 align:middle line:84%
is, our body gets to get these
compounds that are heretofore

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:90%
been identified.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:10%
So there are literally hundreds
and thousands of compounds

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:10%
that these bacteria make.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:10%
Like, there are immune factors
that bacteria make from food.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:90%
They're called bacteriocins.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:90%
It's well known that--

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
for example, like
lactobacillus, plantarum,

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the lactobacilli
make these antimicrobials.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:90%
They make bacterocins.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:90%
They make fungicins.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.350 align:middle line:84%
They actually fight
off other bacteria

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.880 align:middle line:84%
with these small-chain
polypeptides

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:90%
called bacteriocins.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can use them
as antibiotics, right?

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:90%
But they don't.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Most of the antibiotics
actually come from microbes.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:90%
They come from fungi--

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Aspergillus niger.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's being
produced in our body.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And so for immunity,
there's things that

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:90%
are produced for inflammation.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:90%
They keep the inflammation down.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
They change our
glucose metabolism.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you feed the
microbes a lot of oxygen--

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:84%
dissolved oxygen, like
in hyperbaric chambers

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
or high oxygenated
water, and you

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:84%
feed them the right
foods, all of a sudden,

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:15.030 align:middle line:84%
you're getting a shift of these
microbes in the microbiota

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:90%
that we're finding.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And this shift improves
your glucose metabolism.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, some people

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
are saying that it
prevents the cancer cells

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
from being able to stop growing
in the presence of oxygen,

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.620 align:middle line:84%
because it stops what's called
glycolysis and increases

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:90%
oxidative phosphorylation.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So these compounds are
what I'm calling like--

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:84%
these limitless compounds that
makes us live our limitless

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And we don't focus on preparing
and nutrifying and getting

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:84%
our body to amass as many
of these offensive assets

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.085 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I call a
proactive wellness model.

00:22:02.085 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
besides the vinegar,

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of
people have heard--

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
the whole process of
drinking apple cider

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.568 align:middle line:84%
vinegar first thing
in the morning.

00:22:08.568 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And kombucha is really
popular in every flavor

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:84%
imaginable-- you know,
honey lavender and so forth.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
other foods that we

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.585 align:middle line:84%
can consume that are really
strong on short-chain fatty

00:22:18.585 --> 00:22:19.385 align:middle line:90%
acids?

00:22:19.385 --> 00:22:21.468 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, it's not just
short-chain fatty acid.

00:22:21.468 --> 00:22:24.030 align:middle line:90%
That's just one class of things.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But like butyric acid
is very important.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:10%
And it's called butyric
acid because it kind of

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:10%
smells like butter.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you drink
like certain wines that

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
have a buttery taste,
that's butyric acid.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But you get that
from a lot of plants.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:10%
If you have a high
plant-based diet--

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:10%
the reason why people
on plant-based diets

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:10%
are not very obese
is because they're

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:10%
producing a lot of
butyric acid, and they're

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:10%
finding that butyric acid has
a very good direct correlation

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:10%
in being able to
prevent obesity.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:10%
And it's produced in the
part of our intestine

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:10%
where there's no
oxygen. It's produced

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:10%
by the obligate
anaerobe bacteria.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So what we've been
doing is, in our lab,

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.240 align:middle line:84%
we've been replicating this
super fermentation model, where

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
we're fermenting foods with
bacteria that replicate

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
the human gut, the colon,
and we're literally creating

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:90%
these limitless metabolites.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And these metabolites
are solely there

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:90%
to optimize our longevity.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:90%
So I'm calling them longevicans.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:84%
That's the term
you've given them,

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to probably
hear more about in the future.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:90%
But you just said something.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Among those various
metabolites, I

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:84%
think you also said
that it was pyruvate--

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes, malic acid.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, it's
just occurring to me--

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think we even talked
about this on the phone.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I did a series on cancer, and
Dr. Ko, Korean-American woman,

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:12.272 align:middle line:84%
was using this interesting
protocol using bromopyruvate-3.

00:24:12.272 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: 3-bromopyruvate.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 3-bromopyruvate
to dump lactic acid

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:90%
from the cells.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And that die off would not allow
cancer to continue growing.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And so this feeding right
back into the same story

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.066 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:24:25.066 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Well, I can't--

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean partially, in
a sense, it's the same players.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yes, It's the
same class of family,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:84%
except 3-bromopyruvate
is a synthetic compound.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not produced
naturally by the body.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
There's another compound called
DCA, dichloroacetic acid.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
It's got two chlorine molecules
on top of an acidic acid,

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and scientists at the University
of Edmonton back in 2007

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:84%
said, hey, this stops certain
forms of cancer and things

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a compound
that's made naturally

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:84%
by the human body,
but it's related.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:84%
They're literally
short-chain fatty acids.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was saying.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, interesting.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So I'm saying
is that the body has

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:90%
a natural intelligence.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:84%
The microbes have a natural,
biological intelligence

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that they can make
their own products.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
make it for them.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
need the synthetic.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: We don't
need the synthetics

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:90%
if we do our jobs right.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Right now we do,
because we don't know

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.860 align:middle line:90%
which products are being made.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
What we need is the proper
nutrition, the proper mindset,

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and the proper microbes--
just those three things.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I say nutrition,
you need to have--

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.949 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
enough oxygen, you

00:25:40.949 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:84%
have to have the
right kind of water,

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have
the right kind of food.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.891 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't have
the right kind of food,

00:25:46.891 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't convert
into these longevicans.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, you eat a processed
food, for example, that's

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
high and fat, that's high in a
carbohydrate, that's not easily

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
broken down, or a
carbohydrate that's

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:84%
amended by some sort of
genetic modification,

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and the body doesn't know
what to do with that.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make the
right kind of longevican

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
in order to go into the
body to stop inflammation,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:19.090 align:middle line:84%
to increase our immunity,
to regulate our hormones

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:90%
and glucose--

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.240 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.739 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
preceding all of that,

00:26:22.739 --> 00:26:27.480 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned-- and that is
the mind, because of the now

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
generation-long brainwashing
that the human body has

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:84%
no capability of
recovering itself.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:84%
You must go to someone
in a white coat who

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.667 align:middle line:84%
can do something to you,
or at you, or whatever,

00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:90%
in order to recover.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I think it's so
important that people like you

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:90%
speak and say, no, no, no, no.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:46.830 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It's all packaged
inside you, but you

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:84%
have to basically
create a platform for it

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.045 align:middle line:90%
to express itself.

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Exactly.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Our belief system
changes everything.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an
epigenetic change.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
It's more than an
epigenetic change.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's a change of will.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.886 align:middle line:84%
And it's a change of like
getting your power back.

00:27:10.886 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: If I can do anything--

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.380 align:middle line:84%
is I want to tell people
to get your power back.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't give your power away to
external forces that tell you

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.340 align:middle line:90%
what to think and how to think.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got like
an external brain now.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:90%
It's called Google.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, thanks
to you and others.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:32.774 align:middle line:90%
So yes--

00:27:32.774 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: But now, we have our-- we
have the second internal brain.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:84%
We have a biological,
intelligent brain in our guts.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And we can't really
converse with it.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.750 align:middle line:90%
We can't really talk to it.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
But just like computers
need software,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:84%
these biological
computers, these microbes,

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:90%
they need "wetware."

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So the products that we create
in our lab, I consider wetware.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.500 align:middle line:84%
I consider they're
informational signal proteins

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:84%
that we're getting from
these super fermentations.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Like you take like one
drop of this probiotic

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that we make call
ProAlive, and some people

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.980 align:middle line:84%
experience like
an enormous shift.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's information.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:84%
You can sense the
information and the wetware

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.530 align:middle line:84%
going into these
biological computers.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.940 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden, boom.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:90%
They turn on.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And what do you need for
a computer to turn on?

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:26.910 align:middle line:90%
You need electricity.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:90%
You need power.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.750 align:middle line:84%
You need the right
kind of hardware.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.670 align:middle line:90%
And you need the software.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with
our microbes-- you

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:90%
know you need the nutrition.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.812 align:middle line:84%
You need the oxygen. And
you need the microbes--

00:28:38.812 --> 00:28:40.520 align:middle line:84%
so you need the right
kind of equipment--

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.970 align:middle line:84%
but then you need to arm
them with the information.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we get to what I
find the really exciting part,

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.880 align:middle line:84%
because you're starting to
culture these microbiomes

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.950 align:middle line:84%
from the small intestines,
and this can actually

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
be utilized to help
determine a person's health

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.895 align:middle line:84%
profile on the deepest
level of their functioning.

00:28:59.895 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And OK, so just
take off and tell us

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.360 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in
that part of the story.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, first
off, I'm working

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:84%
with these physicians that focus
on the gut and the microbiome,

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and they're called
Mayr physicians.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's spelled M-A-Y-R.
It's based on this Austrian

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.510 align:middle line:84%
physician by the
name of FX Mayr,

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and he tried to help people from
the point of view of their gut.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.905 align:middle line:84%
So he looks at the
health from the points

00:29:29.905 --> 00:29:30.780 align:middle line:90%
of view of their gut.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And most of these
doctors are in Europe.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:90%
And they're based in Austria.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I
go to this clinic

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.710 align:middle line:84%
there to have them
look at our guts

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and see what our body is like,
just from looking at your gut.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So some doctors
look at your tongue.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Some doctors look at your eyes.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And other doctors, they
can look at your hands

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and see what your
health status is.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.490 align:middle line:90%
These people look at your gut.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:90%
And they're amazing doctors.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:10%
And they're an
international association

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:10%
of physicians that are
really focused on the gut

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:10%
health, and the
microbiome health,

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.670 align:middle line:10%
and what things are being
produced in the microbiome.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I had met
through my internet technology

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:90%
conventions--

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I was I was speaking at a
convention called the Web

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Summit last year, and I
met these young doctors

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.170 align:middle line:84%
out of Luxembourg
that were making

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:43.010 align:middle line:84%
machine that can actually
grow the human microbiome

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:90%
in a machine.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow, who
would have thunk it?

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.370 align:middle line:84%
But these guys are
very brilliant.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to divide
up the human gut into five

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
sections, and
they're able to grow

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:84%
the actual human microbiome
to a 92% fidelity rate, which

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.850 align:middle line:90%
is astounding.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Up until now, no
lab in the world

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.850 align:middle line:84%
has been able to grow
the human microbiome up

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.080 align:middle line:90%
past 60% based on DNA analysis.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So you take fecal matter,
you just do all the DNA,

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and you go, OK, so
there's 1,000 species

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.324 align:middle line:90%
of microbes in your gut.

00:31:22.324 --> 00:31:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
actually grow it out,

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:90%
they can only grow out 600.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:27.200 align:middle line:90%
So that 60%.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, these guys can grow
920 species of microbes.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once that's done,
once they have been cultured,

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.715 align:middle line:90%
then what happens?

00:31:36.715 --> 00:31:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, they claimed
I haven't had access

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:42.770 align:middle line:90%
to the machine.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing all the work on
their end with their physicians

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and their work.

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So what they're claiming is
that this machine can actually

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:58.610 align:middle line:84%
segment out the microbes
in five parts of the colon.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And when they
segment it out, you

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.110 align:middle line:84%
have a family of
microbes growing

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.940 align:middle line:90%
in the distal small intestine.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:84%
You have another family
growing in the proximal small

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.010 align:middle line:84%
intestine, and one in
the large intestine,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:90%
and one in the colon.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:90%
And they're all really happy.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you give
them supplements.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.770 align:middle line:84%
You can actually give them
vitamin C, for example,

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:90%
and in every single section.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see what
the effect is on that--

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:90%
on your personal microbiome.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
They say, are you good
with this vitamin C,

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:84%
or are you bad with
this vitamin C?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's get you like
this generic vitamin

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:84%
C in capsules versus, let's get
you this liposomal vitamin C.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.549 align:middle line:84%
They can go to that
degree and see--

00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
highly absorbable.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Which is
highly absorbable.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And let's see what
effect that has

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:84%
on the species of
microbes that grow up.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.452 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it could be
that in one part of the colon,

00:32:53.452 --> 00:32:55.910 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't work, and in another
part, it works beautifully?

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And can the effect on
these different segments

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.875 align:middle line:84%
compete with each
other in its effect?

00:33:00.875 --> 00:33:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It could be, but this
is where our work comes in

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:84%
because we do like the
super fermentation.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have a model where we
would take the human microbiota

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and mix them all together in a
simulated super fermentation.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And the end result is, they can
do a functional metabolic test.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Say like whatever is in
the human microbiome,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.666 align:middle line:84%
they can scoop out
some liquid, and they

00:33:28.666 --> 00:33:31.970 align:middle line:84%
can start to do a gas
chromatograph on it

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and see exactly what
metabolites are being made.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So are these metabolites
inflammatory metabolites?

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:40.640 align:middle line:10%
Meaning that is your body
rejecting it because you're

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:10%
going into inflammation?

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:10%
Or are they low
inflammatory metabolites?

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.940 align:middle line:10%
Is your body actually
healing from this supplement?

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So right now,
that's the direct application

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.050 align:middle line:10%
they can use-- is just subjected
to these various substances?

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:55.884 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:33:55.884 --> 00:33:56.683 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:33:56.683 --> 00:33:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's take
turmeric for example,

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.530 align:middle line:84%
because most people think,
well, that's good for everybody

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:90%
always.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And they've played
with that a little bit?

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: I don't know if
they've played with turmeric,

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.940 align:middle line:84%
we've played with turmeric--
not with their machine,

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:84%
but with our super
fermentation technology,

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:90%
we've played with turmeric.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So the different ways that
we've played with turmeric

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:84%
is, we're looking at turmeric
just as the plant itself,

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying that it's
not bioavailable, and it's true.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get absorbed
very readily unless you

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:90%
add like black pepper.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But we're finding that if
you actually take turmeric

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.479 align:middle line:84%
and you ferment it down via
these different segments

00:34:38.479 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:84%
of the gut, and we simulate
these fermentations

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:45.280 align:middle line:84%
through super fermentation,
it's highly absorbable.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how would
that be applicable

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.810 align:middle line:84%
back to the human being
after this process?

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: OK, so after this
process, these cucerminoids

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.680 align:middle line:84%
that's being absorbed,
it's being put out

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.530 align:middle line:84%
into these different,
what we call longevicans.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So we're finding
out that there's

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:84%
certain flavonoids
that are coming out

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and certain other compounds
that are coming out

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
that's very anti-inflammatory to
the brain, for example, right?

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So we have yet to characterize
these different sets

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:90%
of compounds.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But showing up on a
gas chromatograph,

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:23.010 align:middle line:84%
these compounds are
still uncharacterized,

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.250 align:middle line:84%
but there are certain
compounds that come out

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.680 align:middle line:84%
after the microbes
get done fermenting

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:84%
the turmeric in the body
that science has not yet

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.766 align:middle line:90%
characterized.

00:35:32.766 --> 00:35:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they
haven't characterized

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:39.080 align:middle line:84%
it is because they have no--
they had no way of having

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
a reaction chamber to find out
what might these compounds are.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is a
whole new area of research?

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: A whole new area,
a whole new platform,

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.350 align:middle line:84%
a whole new family
of compounds that

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.720 align:middle line:84%
are being produced
every day in our gut

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.215 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't discovered yet.

00:35:55.215 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
let's for a moment,

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and tell me-- if I may be
totally mistaken on this

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.970 align:middle line:84%
but say going back to
the population in Greece

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.140 align:middle line:84%
that you're working with
on that particular island

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:84%
aren't flavonoids present
in wine, or wine making,

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.160 align:middle line:90%
or the process of wine?

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.369 align:middle line:90%
Do flavonoids come into that?

00:36:10.369 --> 00:36:11.168 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Absolutely.

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
so if you're talking

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.710 align:middle line:84%
about this incredible
mental stability and health

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:19.590 align:middle line:84%
no less 30% of a population
over 130 over 90.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is, again,
flavonoids coming in

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:90%
but from a consumer angle.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So they're drinking
this stuff it's already

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:28.550 align:middle line:84%
fermented the thing
that we got from there

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:32.310 align:middle line:84%
is that they pre-ferment it by
putting it in the wine cask,

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.961 align:middle line:84%
So you're fermenting
it outside the body.

00:36:34.961 --> 00:36:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you take it inside the
body, the microbes are going,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.260 align:middle line:90%
great.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Our job is done for us.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So they can ferment
it even more,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.150 align:middle line:90%
or they can just pass it along.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So by fermenting things outside
and doing super fermentation

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.330 align:middle line:84%
outside the body when you
take it inside the body,

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.930 align:middle line:84%
it makes it easier for your
body to just process it

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:57.260 align:middle line:84%
through and give it to
the cells that we need.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.910 align:middle line:90%
So these people are getting--

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:84%
they eat a lot of fermented
food on this island and Ikaria,

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.870 align:middle line:84%
they drink a lot of
fermented drinks.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:90%
They make their own wine.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Most of these families,
they make their own wines,

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and they make
their own vinegars.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.552 align:middle line:84%
And they're drinking
it all the time.

00:37:14.552 --> 00:37:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
when we're looking

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.830 align:middle line:84%
at all these kind of
popular studies on wine,

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:90%
and, oh, take your resveratrol.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.345 align:middle line:84%
It's reduced down to a
powder form and all that.

00:37:23.345 --> 00:37:25.220 align:middle line:84%
They might be looking
in the wrong direction?

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.189 align:middle line:90%
Or is that part of it?

00:37:26.189 --> 00:37:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's part of it.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, like again, so
we need the proper nutrients.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.240 align:middle line:90%
We need the proper microbes.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.510 align:middle line:90%
And we need the proper mindset.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So without the nutrients,
then the microbes can't work.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
the proper microbes, then

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.610 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much nutrient
and mindset you have,

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.420 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to work, either.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
since so many people

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:84%
you know do enjoy a glass
of wine here and there,

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and listening to this,
just like the coffee

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:84%
drinkers like that
part of the story, what

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.300 align:middle line:84%
about the overall impact if
you're looking at it as a mind,

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.804 align:middle line:90%
body, spirit experience.

00:38:00.804 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at
wine now, looking at it

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.636 align:middle line:84%
from the guts point of
view all the way up to,

00:38:04.636 --> 00:38:06.839 align:middle line:84%
ooo, it's a nice,
little buzz experience.

00:38:06.839 --> 00:38:07.880 align:middle line:90%
How do you perceive that?

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, you look at the
beneficial compounds in wine,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:11.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that
alcohol ethanol may give you

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.339 align:middle line:84%
a nice feeling, but it's not
really a beneficial compound.

00:38:21.339 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm getting to.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: So it's the vinegar.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.890 align:middle line:84%
You know that wine is
basically half the pathway

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:34.455 align:middle line:84%
for the complete
fermentation of a grape?

00:38:34.455 --> 00:38:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Half?

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.657 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Half, yeah.

00:38:36.657 --> 00:38:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where does it
go if it goes all the way?

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: It goes to vinegar.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vinegar?

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're drinking
while the ethanol's high

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.650 align:middle line:90%
and the vinegar part is low?

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:46.816 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's exactly right.

00:38:46.816 --> 00:38:48.250 align:middle line:84%
What they do is,
the winemakers--

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.374 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They truncate it.

00:38:49.374 --> 00:38:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Once the ethanol gets at
its highest peak, they stop it,

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.720 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.490 align:middle line:90%
They put sulfites in there.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.976 align:middle line:90%
They actually kill the bacteria.

00:38:57.976 --> 00:39:00.579 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not with like the
homemade stuff in Greece?

00:39:00.579 --> 00:39:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: No, not like the--

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're just
slipping over into vinegar.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So you get a buzz, but
you're also getting

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.020 align:middle line:90%
the benefits of vinegar.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, they just take
it out, and they drink it.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:84%
They're making wine
like every day.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying like, we
made this two weeks ago,

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.710 align:middle line:84%
so therefore the ethanol
content is this high,

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.570 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to
drink this now.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Or they just let it--

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:24.290 align:middle line:84%
they have like this
huge tub, and when

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.210 align:middle line:84%
the wine isn't so
good to drink, they'll

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:30.170 align:middle line:84%
make their version of balsamic
vinegar in this huge tub,

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and it's amazing stuff.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.954 align:middle line:84%
And then, they put it on their
salads and things like that.

00:39:34.954 --> 00:39:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
just wanted to go down

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.161 align:middle line:84%
that track for a little bit for
people who are thinking, hey!

00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:41.225 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So the thing
is this is like,

00:39:41.225 --> 00:39:44.730 align:middle line:84%
the drinkable vinegars that
you see in Whole Foods--

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.200 align:middle line:84%
there are like
drinkable vinegars now.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:84%
They're much better
for you than wine

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.140 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
acetic acids that

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.390 align:middle line:90%
are really healthy for you--

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:57.740 align:middle line:90%
but not that healthy.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you can
drink like liquids

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that are high in malic
acid, and butyric acid,

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and propionic acid,
that's even better for you

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.580 align:middle line:90%
than acetic acid.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Acetic acid actually makes
you fat, believe it or not.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, so it's been
more associated with obesity

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:15.147 align:middle line:90%
than butyric or propionic acid.

00:40:15.147 --> 00:40:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, this is the
time to get into the acid part

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.560 align:middle line:90%
of the story.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
listening to this

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.250 align:middle line:84%
probably have their
Kangen Water machines

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and are drinking 9.5, 10,
on a scale of alkalinity,

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
water on a daily basis and
maybe even exclusively.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Now you're just
talking about acids

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and the role of these acids.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And we just heard
you also say there

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.080 align:middle line:84%
are beneficial and
not-as-beneficial acids.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So please launch into
the story of alkalinity

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and the human body,
including enforced alkalinity

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.120 align:middle line:90%
through these waters.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.596 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right, OK, so--

00:40:50.596 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
controversial topic, I know.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: I realize that there's
a lot of people that's

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:56.280 align:middle line:90%
going to be very disappointed.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.592 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a
machine, too, by the way.

00:40:58.592 --> 00:40:59.476 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: I do, too.

00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's go for it.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: OK, the human body
is an adaptive mechanism.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.870 align:middle line:90%
It's an adaptive machine.

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So we undergo
homeostasis, meaning

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.710 align:middle line:84%
that if we're too far
one way, the body's

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:23.850 align:middle line:84%
going to do whatever it takes
to get back into alignment.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So our body is meant to
have like a neutral pH--

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:29.820 align:middle line:90%
like a 7.2.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you bring it to
like a very alkaline pH,

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.330 align:middle line:84%
like over 8.1, it's
going to do whatever

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:41.805 align:middle line:84%
it takes to get back into
normality, which is 7.2 to 7.6.

00:41:41.805 --> 00:41:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what will the body
do to struggle to right itself?

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It'll take calcium away
from the body in the long term,

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.340 align:middle line:90%
being too alkaline.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So the issue was when
they started the whole alkaline

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.740 align:middle line:84%
phases, the body was way
too acid because of--

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because of our diet?

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Because of our diet
and the processed foods

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:90%
that people are eating.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:07.470 align:middle line:84%
But we tend to think
that more is better.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's not in the human body.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:13.020 align:middle line:84%
You just have to strike the
right kind of balance, right?

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can be alkaline, and
you could eat alkaline foods.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.134 align:middle line:84%
Like lemon water is acidic,
but it's an alkaline.

00:42:20.134 --> 00:42:21.300 align:middle line:90%
It has an alkalizing effect.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.966 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no
one understands that.

00:42:22.966 --> 00:42:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Tell us why that is.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.040 align:middle line:90%
Do you know why?

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.110 align:middle line:84%
No one's actually
explained it yet.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, it doesn't
really turn your body alkaline

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:37.200 align:middle line:84%
directly, but citric acid
has an effect in the body

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.030 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that it affects
the different enzymatic

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:47.246 align:middle line:84%
processes in the body to
normalize the pH in the body.

00:42:47.246 --> 00:42:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I'll just leave it at that.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:49.664 align:middle line:90%
It's a very complex--

00:42:49.664 --> 00:42:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It's one that's not
well understood.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.430 align:middle line:90%
So, OK, go ahead.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So there are a lot
of other beneficial acids.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:01.050 align:middle line:90%
And people-- we need acids.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Our gut needs an acidic
environment to live.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Our gut cannot take an
alkaline environment.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can't digest
food properly, can it?

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.951 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It can't
digest food properly.

00:43:08.951 --> 00:43:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And plus, our stomach is pH2!

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.680 align:middle line:84%
We keep drinking alkaline water,
and you raise that pH even one,

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.520 align:middle line:84%
to pH3, that's a
10 times increase

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.837 align:middle line:90%
loss of hydrochloric acid.

00:43:21.837 --> 00:43:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then
it can't do its job?

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.795 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It can't
do its job right.

00:43:24.795 --> 00:43:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So in the long term,
I don't believe

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:32.940 align:middle line:84%
in a high alkaline
water consumption

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.740 align:middle line:90%
for long-term health.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting,
too, I noticed in the literature

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.590 align:middle line:90%
on the various machines--

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.950 align:middle line:84%
alkaline water machines--
is that it will say,

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:49.650 align:middle line:84%
if you have food
poisoning, for example,

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:53.610 align:middle line:84%
or if you have a cut on your
body, use the runoff water,

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:56.040 align:middle line:84%
as it separates out
into the main faucet

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.090 align:middle line:90%
with high alkalinity.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:03.150 align:middle line:84%
The dumping valve is very acidic
water that's separated out.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:middle line:90%
It'll say, keep that on hand.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what you use
for healing, whether it's

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.720 align:middle line:84%
on a wound, or
whether it's if you

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.960 align:middle line:84%
feel you have food
poisoning, a stomach flu--

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:90%
drink some of that acid water.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So this explains why you
would drink that acid water.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right, because it has--

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's like
usually three point, right?

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:24.509 align:middle line:84%
It helps your gut to
renormalize itself.

00:44:24.509 --> 00:44:25.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:44:25.425 --> 00:44:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Right, it adds
the acid into your belly.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we get into
the notion of diet in general.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, this comes
up in a lot of shows.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people do
better with veganism.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Some people do
better with Paleo.

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:84%
That's mostly steeped
in vegetables.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the diet
philosophy's mostly

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.989 align:middle line:84%
vegetables, and some
proteins, and some fats.

00:44:46.989 --> 00:44:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And we look at the
vegetable kingdom, which

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.190 align:middle line:90%
tends to be alkaline, right?

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.823 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then we look
at the kingdom of eggs, meat,

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and all these other things tend
to be heavily or more acidic.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So what is your view about the
various food intake, knowing

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that it's highly
individual in terms

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.520 align:middle line:84%
of feeding the proper
microbiomes in the body?

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Got it.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's all a matter
of individual preference

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and taste.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:20.700 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that
whatever we can

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.960 align:middle line:84%
do to be more in partnership
with nature and the earth

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and more sustainable
is the thing to do.

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
The biological intelligence
that's in our gut

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.320 align:middle line:84%
is all about
communing with nature.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.670 align:middle line:84%
It keeps us from being
divorced from nature.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that our
divorce from nature

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.150 align:middle line:84%
is a product of this new
artificial intelligence--

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:50.150 align:middle line:84%
this new technology
information phenomenon

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.470 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing,
where we're losing

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.430 align:middle line:90%
that divorce from nature.

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to build
up our microbiome in the gut

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.510 align:middle line:84%
to amass this biological
information so we live

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.480 align:middle line:84%
a limitless lifestyle,
so we get the most amount

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.440 align:middle line:84%
of, what I call,
longevicans in our body.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And whatever way your body
can amass those longevicans

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.806 align:middle line:84%
in a sustainable, earth-friendly
manner, I'm all for it.

00:46:20.806 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and it
is highly individual,

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.721 align:middle line:84%
and you know because the
proof is in the pudding.

00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:26.460 align:middle line:84%
The state of your
health will show you

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.310 align:middle line:90%
that you're on the right path.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Now my wife is vegan--

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:35.050 align:middle line:84%
not vegan, she's plant-based,
but I'm not plant-based.

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And I try my hardest to
be plant-based as much

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.690 align:middle line:84%
as possible, and I have
to eat meat now and then,

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:41.490 align:middle line:90%
and not just--

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:44.530 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:45.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't like to eat pork.

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I can't eat fish, because
I feel like a lot of the fish

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:90%
is toxic.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:90%
So I end up eating chicken.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:55.650 align:middle line:90%
But I have to eat meat.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And my body just feels
better with meat.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I just feel
more strengthened with it.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is a real
issue in a lot of families.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: And I feel guilty.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm in
the same situation.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.270 align:middle line:90%
My husband is a vegan.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And he's strong, and
he's mentally clear,

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.010 align:middle line:90%
and just beautiful.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And after 20 years,
for me, I was

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.500 align:middle line:84%
slipping so badly, that I had
to go back into also chicken

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.260 align:middle line:90%
and free-range, grass-fed beef.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.137 align:middle line:90%
And I feel guilty.

00:47:26.137 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So I tend not to do
it because I don't

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.230 align:middle line:90%
want to cook it around him.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to subject him
to this lower consciousness

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.070 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.710 align:middle line:84%
This is how I am
projecting it on myself.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time, if
I don't do it for long enough,

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I start feeling my health
start slipping again.

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: And exactly.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And previously, I
thought, oh, it's

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:48.007 align:middle line:84%
just a matter of the microbes
creating these things

00:47:48.007 --> 00:47:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because they say
that the microbes are

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:53.700 align:middle line:84%
the ones that crave the
foods that you want to eat.

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you find
it is true about that?

00:47:56.175 --> 00:47:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: I don't know.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:03.030 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I try to get on
a plant-based diet and say,

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:08.760 align:middle line:90%
maybe my microbes should shift.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.010 align:middle line:90%
But then, it doesn't happen.

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm not being
disciplined enough.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.234 align:middle line:90%
But you were vegan for 20 years.

00:48:15.234 --> 00:48:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
vegetarian for 20 years.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Vegetarian for 20 years.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And you found out that
something was missing.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I found this in
several other people.

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:26.190 align:middle line:84%
They've been vegan, or
vegetarian, and plant-based,

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and then they had to revert back
to eating some sort of animal

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:33.440 align:middle line:84%
protein every once in a while,
just to get their bodies back

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.240 align:middle line:90%
into balance.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So I know that somehow their
microbes are in their body.

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.620 align:middle line:84%
They're not leaving, and
they're craving this food,

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.980 align:middle line:84%
saying that, I need to make this
food to ferment it to give you

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:47.915 align:middle line:84%
these fermented
metabolites to make my body

00:48:47.915 --> 00:48:52.230 align:middle line:84%
the healthiest, optimized for
longevity body in the world.

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and I asked
you that question initially

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.630 align:middle line:84%
because it is a more
acidic food group.

00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so going
back into that, one thing

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.270 align:middle line:84%
we talked about on
the phone in prep

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:84%
for this was that
there haven't really

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:10.410 align:middle line:84%
been any in-depth
studies on the alkalinity

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:14.370 align:middle line:84%
in the human body and its
long-term effects, right?

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying it's
causing detrimental effects

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.160 align:middle line:84%
to the microbiome to go
tip over into alkalinity.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.149 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: No, I wouldn't say--

00:49:22.149 --> 00:49:23.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to say that.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say it's
causing detrimental effects

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.440 align:middle line:84%
because there hasn't
been really any--

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.564 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's no study?

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:28.665 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: I just think the
study is kind of moot.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like I don't--

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I think the body is a
homeostatic mechanism.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It's going to do whatever it
takes to stay in pH balance.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think you should
be too much in alkalinity

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.790 align:middle line:90%
or too much in acidity.

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I would want
to be more alkaline than acid.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:50.310 align:middle line:90%
It's proven.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:51.649 align:middle line:90%
It's a proven fact.

00:49:51.649 --> 00:49:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want
to just, I'll just

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.960 align:middle line:84%
leave it-- that you don't
want to be too alkaline.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.376 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
balance yourself.

00:49:56.376 --> 00:49:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
let's look at the project

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:02.010 align:middle line:84%
you're directly involved in, and
what you think the outcome is

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:05.670 align:middle line:84%
going to be in this,
and how available might

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.130 align:middle line:84%
this type of
testing, so to speak,

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.650 align:middle line:90%
become for the public at large?

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:12.676 align:middle line:84%
What are the
implications of that?

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, the
project that I'm

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:19.140 align:middle line:84%
involved in called the
Longevican Project is A,

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to do these super
fermentation techniques.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to create
nutritional supplements,

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:32.690 align:middle line:84%
like in our toothpaste
and in these new prashas

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to come out
with-- these new energy drinks.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I want
to hear about that.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little more.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: The energy drinks?

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, well, the
energy drinks are basically

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:43.665 align:middle line:90%
energy for our mitochondria.

00:50:43.665 --> 00:50:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, god,
that sounds wonderful.

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So the mitochondria
are actually microbes.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:51.150 align:middle line:84%
So I've been looking at them
from a microbial point of view.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can have
another talk about why

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I think the mitochondria
are really the human body.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: And when they evolved,
they co-evolved with a human

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:04.140 align:middle line:90%
being--

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.340 align:middle line:84%
the eukaryotic organism
experience a monumental shift.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.810 align:middle line:84%
It was able to
take over the globe

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and become the
dominant life force,

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.190 align:middle line:90%
the eukaryotes on the earth.

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And the eukaryotes that
spin out the mitochondria

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.440 align:middle line:90%
became parasites.

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.980 align:middle line:84%
All the parasites have very low
or actually no mitochondria,

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.740 align:middle line:84%
like giardia has
no mitochondria.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on the host to
suck energy off of the host,

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And I would say like, parasitic
human beings maybe have

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.895 align:middle line:90%
a mitochondrial dysfunction.

00:51:36.895 --> 00:51:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perhaps.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Because
they're low on energy.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:44.335 align:middle line:84%
And so these energy
drinks are filled with--

00:51:44.335 --> 00:51:45.960 align:middle line:84%
number one, they're
filled with oxygen.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.650 align:middle line:90%
They're hyperoxygenated drinks.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:51.330 align:middle line:84%
But they also are filled with
the right kind of mineral

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.890 align:middle line:84%
content, and they have these--
what I call these longevicans

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:55.690 align:middle line:90%
in there--

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:58.800 align:middle line:84%
these small-chain fatty
acids, these polypeptides,

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.730 align:middle line:84%
these lipopolysaccharides
that are solely there

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:06.750 align:middle line:84%
to help the mitochondria
function better,

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:10.194 align:middle line:84%
help the mitochondria
die off and regrow.

00:52:10.194 --> 00:52:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't that something
that's misunderstood?

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.610 align:middle line:84%
That once mitochondria's
dead, it's dead?

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:17.940 align:middle line:84%
You can't really
repopulate your body?

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:18.970 align:middle line:90%
That's not true, is it?

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's not true at all.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think the
mitochondria are probably

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:25.125 align:middle line:84%
the most misunderstood
organelle--

00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:27.826 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we can't wait
this long for another interview,

00:52:27.826 --> 00:52:29.700 align:middle line:84%
because that would be
months and months away.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Just give us a
couple hints-- what

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:34.620 align:middle line:84%
are some of the things we can
do to, right now today, start

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.870 align:middle line:84%
boosting our levels
of mitochondria?

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:38.465 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Green
apples, for example.

00:52:38.465 --> 00:52:39.735 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Green apples?

00:52:39.735 --> 00:52:41.820 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: Right,
green apples have--

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.730 align:middle line:10%
if you juice green
apples, number one,

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:48.480 align:middle line:10%
it has a high level
of malic acid.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that deals with
the TCA or the Krebs cycle

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.810 align:middle line:84%
knows that malic
acid gets shunted

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:59.640 align:middle line:84%
into acetic acid, which
are known to boost

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.647 align:middle line:90%
the function of mitochondria.

00:53:01.647 --> 00:53:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
simple thing right there.

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Our drinks are filled
with that malic acid and forms

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.190 align:middle line:84%
of haloacetic acid, but
also all these other signal

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:15.780 align:middle line:84%
proteins that are there
to enhance the viability

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.219 align:middle line:90%
of our mitochondria.

00:53:17.219 --> 00:53:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, this is exciting.

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: So that's one hack.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So all these really
simple bioacts--

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:28.120 align:middle line:90%
there are coenzyme that--

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and there are other compounds
that help the mitochondria.

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.250 align:middle line:84%
There's this one
coenzyme called NAD.

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:39.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: NAD, yeah.

00:53:39.575 --> 00:53:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: And believe
it or not, there

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:47.820 align:middle line:84%
are bacterial metabolites that
enhance the formation of NAD.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can get these
bacterial metabolites

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:52.060 align:middle line:84%
through this super
fermentation product.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're putting that
into our probiotic water.

00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm really
excited about this.

00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.947 align:middle line:90%
When's that go into production?

00:53:59.947 --> 00:54:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: When's that
go into production?

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, we got the water
in production now.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And this water has a
lot of oxygen in it.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Our water is
basically pure water,

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and we crystallize it using
these crystals from deep down

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.200 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.721 align:middle line:84%
There's this lake that these
Russians found in Antarctica

00:54:19.721 --> 00:54:20.970 align:middle line:90%
when they started drinking it.

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:25.030 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, people
started to get better.

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to--

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Putin's
big on this stuff.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: He is.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:31.630 align:middle line:84%
He actually drinks this
water, believe it or not.

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of football
players in the United States

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.060 align:middle line:84%
drink this type of
oxygenated water.

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why shouldn't we have
the advantage Putin has, right?

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.280 align:middle line:84%
He's always showing you his
body that looks good at 63 or 64

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.080 align:middle line:90%
often.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.079 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: And you know why?

00:54:45.079 --> 00:54:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Look at his body, you know?

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he
looks like a young man.

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:48.803 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: You know why?

00:54:48.803 --> 00:54:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Is because he has
very low inflammation.

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Like inflammation levels
are the number one thing

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:55.510 align:middle line:90%
to take care of our body.

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Then, we have to look at our
cardiovascular and immune

00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:58.650 align:middle line:90%
status.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you drink water
that's really high in oxygen,

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.965 align:middle line:84%
they're finding out that
it deinflames your body.

00:55:04.965 --> 00:55:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:09.510 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: Like we've had
just testimonials--

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:10.830 align:middle line:10%
this is not a health claim--

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:16.260 align:middle line:10%
but we've had testimonials
of people like over 50

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:20.970 align:middle line:10%
that claim not to have to go
to the bathroom so many times

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:24.490 align:middle line:10%
at night, just by
drinking this water

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:29.040 align:middle line:10%
that we have with these stable
water clusters and high oxygen

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.760 align:middle line:10%
levels of water.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:31.560 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For our
next discussion.

00:55:32.445 --> 00:55:33.612 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:55:33.612 --> 00:55:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Compton,
we're out of time.

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I just, as always, I absolutely
love chatting with you.

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
like doing things

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:42.030 align:middle line:84%
that look like infomercials,
but the stuff you do

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:45.440 align:middle line:84%
is in such integrity,
I really can't wait.

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.880 align:middle line:90%
So I just have to say that.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:47.840 align:middle line:90%
