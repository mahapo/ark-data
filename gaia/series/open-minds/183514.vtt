>>REGINA MEREDITH: We're
talking with a scientists

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.540 align:middle line:10%
I have an immense
amount of respect

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.480 align:middle line:10%
for, as he's dedicated his
research to understanding,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.170 align:middle line:10%
and even more so, making visible
the energies of everything

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:10%
in and around us.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:84%
As a former member of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
biophysicist Dr.
Konstantin Korotkov

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
developed a means of seeing
our energetic imprint, called

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:90%
electrophotonics.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:84%
This has shown us worlds of
information formerly hidden

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:90%
from view.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going to
talk about how that plays out

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
with our modern lifestyle and
our health issues en masse.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Woo, boy, we have so many
chronic health issues.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:84%
From little kids
through adults, it

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:84%
seems as though everyone's
allergic to something now,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and having some kind of
problem, allergies of all kinds

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:84%
that when I was a kid you
just didn't really see.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:90%
It was rare.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.418 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'd have a kid
in class with allergies,

00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:90%
but that was about it.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:90%
It's changing, isn't it?

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:10%
>>KONSTANTIN KOROTKOV:
Yes, and we know why.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:10%
The main problem now is
the change of microbiome.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The microbiome, OK,
the microbiome in the body,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:10%
in the digestive-- the flora and
such in our digestive tracts.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're going to go there.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.822 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually going to
spend a good amount of time

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's just, for people who
don't already know your work,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
let's back up a little
bit and find out

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:84%
what it was that impassioned
you to do what you've ended up

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
doing with your life, which
is so incredibly important.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Everything is energy.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
We could never
see its influence.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:90%
And now we can because of you.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Your work is incredible.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So what happened early
on in your studies

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.033 align:middle line:84%
that made you understand
this had to happen?

00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You
see, first of all,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:84%
my background was
quantum physics.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And after graduating
university, I

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:84%
start operating as
quantum physicist

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
with plasma physics, cosmic
physic, and some other lines.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was working in this
field for a long time.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was very interesting.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But still, I was always
interested in life.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: In medicine.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I had-- at some
time, I was thinking,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.575 align:middle line:84%
should I go to medicine,
or should I go to physics?

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But finally, I decided
to go to physics.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I had many
contacts in medicine.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And I start using medicine,
because one more topic.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I was a member of a Russian
mountain rescue team

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mountain rescue team?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yeah, because
I was professional mountaineer.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.653 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, if
someone got in trouble,

00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:90%
you would rescue them.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:90%
This is quite literal.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And we had
a training on medicine,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
just first aid,
because you understand,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
if you go to the mountains,
either that or something

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:84%
with a person, not always
we have doctors with us.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So we were trained
how to use medications,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:84%
how to make injections, how
to make bandages, like this.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And so more and more, I
was coming into biology,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:90%
into medicine.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.805 align:middle line:84%
Then at some moment, I was
introduced to Kirlian effect.

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The Kirlian?

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.513 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And most of us
know Kirlian photography.

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Most of this audience
knows this, where you

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:90%
go to a fair, a new-age fair.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:90%
You stand in front of a camera.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it shows you
what color your aura is.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.745 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: It's
just a wonderful toy.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And a lot of
people was just trying

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:84%
not just only to play but
to do something with this.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So in 19th
century, 20th century,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
it was a lot of people who
was interested in this topic

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.530 align:middle line:90%
and was doing something.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was, again,
became interested.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And this topic
attracted the attention

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.543 align:middle line:84%
of our Academy of
Science of Soviet Union.

00:03:53.543 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
Academy of Sciences?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.225 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes.

00:03:56.225 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was
academician Diviatkov,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:84%
who was the head of one
department of quantum physics.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And he offered to make
research on this topic.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, it came
director of our university,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.777 align:middle line:84%
then to head of
department, then to myself.

00:04:10.777 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that's
wonderful, because that's not

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.235 align:middle line:84%
something that would have
happened, per se, in the United

00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physicists here
seem to be categorized

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
a little bit differently
and almost seen as kind of,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
almost marginalized,
again, because

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:84%
of the simple fact that you
can't see the effects of what

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:90%
they're talking about.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to be
a very material--

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
scientific materialism
reigns in the United States,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:90%
as you well know.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And you have to go--

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
so it sounds like
the Soviet Union

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:84%
was willing to go beyond
scientific materialism.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.460 align:middle line:84%
In Soviet Union, it was
much more open vision.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And that's why we
had research in many areas.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
It was principle, accepted
as not classical, of course,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:90%
and maybe some even strange.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So that is
why I've been involved

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.280 align:middle line:90%
in the study of Kirlian effect.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I had the presentation at
Academy of Science in Moscow.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Then I had my PhD on this topic.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And then more and more, I
came to biology and medicine,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
ultimately produced what

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.075 align:middle line:90%
we call the Bio-Well today.

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:15.742 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:05:15.742 --> 00:05:16.985 align:middle line:90%
It was our final stage.

00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, which I assume
thousands of practitioners

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:90%
around the world are using now.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so just looking
into taking it from Kirlian

00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
photography, where
you're at a fair,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.188 align:middle line:84%
and you see that you have
a bright yellow, or purple,

00:05:27.188 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
or whatever going on in your
aura, yours is very specific,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's taking information
from all the meridians ending

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.772 align:middle line:90%
in the fingertips, right?

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:36.938 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:36.938 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And reading from all
of these, each one associated

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
with different organs and so
forth, taking that information

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and showing it in a
digital display, right?

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And what's most important, we
can see energy problems long

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:90%
before symptoms experience.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that a
moment, because some people

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
psychic phenomena

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:84%
can read those energy imprints,
some good medical intuitives.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what
they're actually looking at,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and what the Bio-Well very
accurately is picking up.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So we are talking about
biological field, biofield.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, this now,
it's well-accepted notion

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:90%
in science.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's a field
produced by our body,

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:84%
because we have
currents in our body.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.482 align:middle line:84%
We can measure
electrocardiogram,

00:06:21.482 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
electromyogram, or
electroencephalogram.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.295 align:middle line:90%
It's all currents.

00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:27.605 align:middle line:84%
If there are currents,
there are fields.

00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So now we can measure all this
parameters outside of the body.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we communicate
with surrounding,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
with environment,
with our fields.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's not
only electrical.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.950 align:middle line:84%
There are many other
components in this field.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, it
was always people

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
who was able to see this,
because part of this field,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:90%
it is visible.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:90%
It's photons.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: And with our
approach, with Bio-Well.com,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:10%
we have now instrument that
allow us to measure this,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:10%
from fingers, by fingers,
because those are most

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:10%
sensitive part of our body.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, for children, they
need to touch everything.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
We shake hands, and
we feel each other.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So because the very-- a
lot of sensitive areas

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
we have on our hands
and our fingers.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
measuring from fingers,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:90%
we have a lot of information.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:84%
We make interpretation based on
traditional Chinese medicine,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic medicine,
acupuncture principles.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And we have 25 years, or
even 30 years, of experience.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
In this experience, it
was clinical studies

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.100 align:middle line:84%
in top-level
universities of Russia,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
medical universities, of
St. Petersburg, Moscow,

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:51.512 align:middle line:84%
and Novosibirsk, other cities,
in United States as well.

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have many
papers published

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:90%
from American scientists.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And now a lot coming in
India, in South America.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's big, more than maybe
200 papers published only

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:90%
on medical research.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:84%
That is why if we
claim that we have

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
some connection between
fingers and organs,

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.370 align:middle line:90%
it is based on clinical study.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.997 align:middle line:84%
And what's most important,
it's not diagnostics.

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's not--

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: It is not, no.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a lot
of people think of it

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:90%
as a diagnostic device.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.555 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No, no, no, no.

00:08:21.555 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It's analysis.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Analysis.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the difference
between those.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.983 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:08:25.983 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Diagnostic, it is conclusion
done by medical doctor

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:84%
or by professional based
on different analysis.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.999 align:middle line:84%
So no device never
make the diagnostics.

00:08:36.999 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: It produce analysis.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK,
that makes sense.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.262 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Then doctor
should look to this.

00:08:42.262 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, we have
CT scan or PET scan.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Without doctor, it's nothing.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, so--

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.467 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
just indicating.

00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:50.883 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
indication there.

00:08:50.883 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So it should be professional,
who are well trained.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:90%
And we give training, of course.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:90%
We provide courses.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:84%
We have books and
papers published.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And then people
who understand what

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:84%
this mean, they can make
very good contributions,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:90%
for example, most important.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Most important, this
prediction of what may happen.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:90%
So we can detect--

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's based
on kind of probabilities.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, of course.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Historically
and medically,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.705 align:middle line:84%
when you see
something in a field,

00:09:16.705 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
it's likely going to
go that direction.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
yes, yes, absolute.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So we can detect weak areas of
the body, potential problems.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.772 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And
then, of course, best

00:09:25.772 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:84%
if people can resolve
these problems.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And then they have no--

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before they
manifest physically.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.643 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So we always tell, OK, you
have this and this problem.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Please go to medical doctor.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Make this and this type
of analysis, diagnosis,

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%
diagnostics.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you will
understand what's going on.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.488 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And we
have many cases.

00:09:45.488 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, no,
it's beautiful,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see it
energetically before it's fully

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:90%
dense in the physical body.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is just kind of
streaming in as we're talking.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So as a person is sitting there
using the Bio-Well device,

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and we know that it's
reading these fields,

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
these photons, we also know
that between the photons

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
is a massive amount of space
filled with intelligence,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Information that has
come randomly from the outside,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
but also from the inside in
terms of our own feelings

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:90%
and thoughts.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So how does the
mind- if someone's

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
sitting there and
doing this, how

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:84%
can the mind play in to
actually skew or change

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:90%
the results in the biofield?

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Or can it?

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, it's one
of the interesting application

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:90%
of Bio-Well.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
We can measure,
detect human emotions.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I mean,
and the mind and emotions

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.987 align:middle line:90%
are so deeply connected.

00:10:40.987 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
yes, yes, absolutely,

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
because we understand,
you are absolutely right,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that our behavior, our body
is governed by our mind,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and by our emotions,
by our feelings.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, which
goes into the density,

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, if we have a
lot of negativity, right?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Positive, negative,
it's all reflected.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.788 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And,
of course, stress.

00:11:01.788 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the main
danger of many people.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And we have very
clear parameters.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
We can measure level of stress
in numbers from 0 to 10.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
We can measure balance of
sympathetic-parasympathetic

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:90%
nervous system.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: That's--

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you
finding when you're

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:84%
seeing the results
from around the world

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:84%
that the parasympathetic
and sympathetic are

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:90%
out of whack now?

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, I can
give you a very clear example.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Just in autumn time,
one good colleague,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:90%
one friend came to me.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And I've done his measurement.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:90%
He had very strange situation.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
He was, and he is
a big businessman,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:90%
big business in Russia.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.960 align:middle line:90%
And he's a very strong guy.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:90%
He was playing hockey, training.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And then he told a
very interesting story,

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that from October he start
feeling worse and worse.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
He start feeling pain
in different parts

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:84%
of the body, headache
that he never had before.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Then he was eating
in a restaurant,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:90%
and he start vomiting.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It was, for him, it
was like a shock.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.455 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And then it
was difficult for him

00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:90%
even to eat something.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So his wife has
very high position

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:90%
in our medical university.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So he had all possible
medical analysis.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything is fine.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
His physical body
is totally normal.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:90%
But something is going on.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was a type
of chronic fatigue

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.380 align:middle line:90%
that he start developing.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I ask him, what has
happened in September?

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.340 align:middle line:84%
He told he had a very stressful
situation with his business.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
He was really afraid
of everything,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:90%
but then it was resolved.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's very typical station.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Station is the result.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stress?

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, stress is gone.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.817 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But so let's talk
about that for a moment,

00:12:42.817 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:84%
the stress's affect on the
sympathetic, parasympathetic

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:84%
system, because so many people
are in sympathetic overdrive.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about how that works,

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and that may be what
was going on with him.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, it--

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you have
to have parasympathetic just

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:84%
to digest your food and
relax and eat, right?

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.623 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:56.623 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So we have special
program, Bio-Well,

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:84%
that allows to
evaluate this balance

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:84%
between sympathetic
and parasympathetic.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:84%
When I look to his data, I've
seen it's total misbalance,

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:90%
total.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Out of balance.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Out of
balance, absolutely.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mostly towards
the sympathetic, I assume?

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Total dominance--

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dominant
sympathetic, yeah.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: --of
sympathetic nervous system.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So it was absolute
clear the reason

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:90%
of his physiological condition.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And
I've told him this.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:90%
I explained this.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:90%
So he shouldn't be afraid.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But he should do this, this,
and this, just relaxation,

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:84%
different exercises, walking
around, going to nature,

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and just stop thinking about
his business for maybe a month.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And, you see, after
a month of following

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:84%
all these recommendations,
he was absolutely normal.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's so simple.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:84%
But if it goes
unchecked, and you

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:84%
continue in
sympathetic overdrive,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:84%
tell us the result of that on
our physical body, ultimately.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, we have
autonomic nervous system

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:84%
that governs all our
physiological activity.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
it's under control

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.850 align:middle line:84%
of sympathetic-parasympathetic
activity.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So if we have
sympathetic dominance,

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.598 align:middle line:84%
it means that all systems
are on with high intention.

00:14:06.598 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're on, on,
on, pedal to the metal.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.932 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's like someone is
running and can't stop.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
what's going on after?

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Finally, he fells off and die.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: He's
totally exhausted.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
here, so for people

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.080 align:middle line:84%
who have this dominance,
have permanent stress

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, of
course, it's a lot

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:84%
of negative problems in the
body with adrenal glands,

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.363 align:middle line:90%
with different hormones.

00:14:34.363 --> 00:14:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't it also create
more acidity within the system?

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Of course.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Of
course, sure, sure.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:90%
We understand.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And what's important, it creates
a lot of acidity for heart.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, very good.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
reason of heart problems.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So not some eating
fats or something

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.153 align:middle line:84%
create problems
but heart itself.

00:14:55.153 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That makes sense,
because people in cardiac care

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:84%
are very split even on
cholesterol anymore.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
What's good for one person isn't
the same for another person.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But this one thing seems
to be a common denominator.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
If you have too much
acidity in the heart tissue,

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:84%
you could end up very
likely with heart disease.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.138 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:15:13.138 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So we understand that if people
have this permanent stress,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:84%
sympathetic dominance,
then it's very likely

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:90%
to develop a lot of problems.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:84%
First of all, of
course, cardio problems.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Second is diabetes.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Diabetes.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes,
because it's normally--

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's type 2 diabetes
that you see a real rise in,

00:15:30.795 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:90%
in the United States now.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stress related?

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Stress related,
absolutely, stress and sugar

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.380 align:middle line:90%
related, of course.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And, oh, sugar, yeah.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:37.755 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:15:37.755 --> 00:15:40.420 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely here, mostly
here in the United States.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And then, of
course, hypertension as well.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.578 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hypertension, yeah.

00:15:45.578 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah, because
it's all different phases

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.940 align:middle line:84%
of this problem, because our
system is overall a united

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:90%
It's integrated.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
If something is
going on somewhere,

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:90%
it reflects everything.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now if
a person is using--

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
being analyzed
with the Bio-Well,

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.845 align:middle line:84%
are they going to analyze
the autonomic nervous system?

00:16:08.845 --> 00:16:11.178 align:middle line:84%
Or is that one of the things
that's looked at right away

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
so you can see, hey,
you're going too fast,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
you've got to slow down, you
need to unplug for a while?

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.148 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
assume that would

00:16:17.148 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:84%
be, with a huge percentage
of the population, what

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:90%
would come back.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.747 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And so what's going on, and
if we explain this to people,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:84%
if we show them, look,
this is a picture,

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and this is this and this,
then a lot of people,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:90%
they change their life.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And later
on they come to us

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and tell, oh, thank you, because
I was able to change my life.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.797 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Those
switched to healthy life,

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and then it helped health.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's so wonderful.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:84%
What about-- let's
back it up a bit.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
stress and lifestyle.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Information is coming at
speeds now that our brain never

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
had to contend with
before, through all

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84%
the different modalities
of media in particular

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and in a digital
manner as well, so if--

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
plus, the load of toxins in our
stream of food, in our water,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.460 align:middle line:90%
in our beverages.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.420 align:middle line:84%
If we were to go back 100
years and look at the health

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.890 align:middle line:84%
profile of citizens of
the planet in general,

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
compared to today, and
even the table by saying,

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:84%
no antibiotics, no
extreme intervention,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:84%
what would our
lifespans and lives

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.550 align:middle line:84%
be looking like if we didn't
have allopathic medicine

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:90%
to mask it and do quick fixes?

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You know, it
is, we have statistics.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:90%
And statistics shows us numbers.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolute clear, after
'60s, life span increased

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.170 align:middle line:90%
tremendously.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Child survival, baby survival
increased tremendously.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:49.267 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So now
we have populations

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that much more healthier
compared with previous times.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so 100 years
ago, because of also a lack

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.135 align:middle line:90%
of nutrients oftentimes--

00:17:59.135 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, lack

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:84%
of nutrients, lack
of medical care,

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
no developed medicine
like we do now,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.380 align:middle line:84%
no real surgeries
like we do now.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So we need to accept that all
advance of modern medicine

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:90%
really change life of--

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:90%
But let's remove all that.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And if we eat like
we eat, live like we

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:84%
live right now, compared
to 100 years ago,

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.775 align:middle line:90%
what would that look like?

00:18:23.775 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, again,
without modern medicine,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:84%
life is impossible
now, because--

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I'm asking you.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, no, no, no.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.745 align:middle line:90%
We should understand.

00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
We all have some problems
from time to time.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.875 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: It may be accidents.

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:90%
It may be illness.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:90%
It may be this or that.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And modern medicine is
tremendously powerful.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Of course,
this has dead ends.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.250 align:middle line:90%
It has some limitations now.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Scientists try to do
something, and that's

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
why I has tremendous
respect to medical science,

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:84%
because it allows
to move forward.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But chronic
diseases seems

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
to be the bugaboo, the
heart, the difficult area.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.548 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: But you see,
yeah, that problem is false,

00:19:01.548 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that 100 years ago, people
didn't live long enough to have

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.405 align:middle line:90%
this type of disease.

00:19:05.405 --> 00:19:06.572 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's true.

00:19:06.572 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:84%
What was the average lifespan,
say, in Russia 100 years ago?

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you had
issues of starvation.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, not only
starvation, but all life span

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.445 align:middle line:90%
was about 35, 40 years.

00:19:16.445 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Not more than that.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Only that?

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Only that in Russia.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, see, I would have
guessed it to be closer to 50.

00:19:22.083 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So no one had any chronic
health-- age-related disease,

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, because
you didn't live--

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: All people
was dying from accidents,

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
from little cut on your finger,
from bad food, from bad water,

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
because water was not
good at all in most cities

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:90%
in many places.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: True, there
was no purification.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.427 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:19:41.427 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if we talk about some
people living in the mountain,

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.487 align:middle line:84%
they were living up to 100
years, because it was pure--

00:19:46.487 --> 00:19:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the Euro mountains.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: --life.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Yes, yes, yes, absolutely,
then everything.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But if we talk
about cities mostly,

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.363 align:middle line:90%
then it was very poor life.

00:19:55.363 --> 00:19:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.197 align:middle line:84%
So we don't need to look to
the past outside of these,

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:01.530 align:middle line:84%
what they call the Blue Zones,
right, around the world--

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where
people have pure water.

00:20:03.748 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:84%
They have access to a
variety of foods and proteins

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So kind of looking
back and glamorizing

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
the notion of our health
profile in the past

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:84%
actually doesn't
work too well, I

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
think what I'm really getting to
is if those people in that time

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:84%
were living on the quality
of food the masses are living

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:90%
on today--

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.907 align:middle line:84%
mass-produced food with lots
of chemicals and so forth.

00:20:28.907 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, but there
are one more interesting topic.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: We have
very distinct study

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
done by two oncologists,
two professors.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And I know them very well.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were studying
lifespan of people.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Beginning from, seems
to me, 16th century,

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:84%
they collected data on life span
depending on different factors.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
On profession, what they
found, the longest lifespan,

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:90%
they have musical conductors.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe that.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
The frequencies of music alone
and the harmonics that creates

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.200 align:middle line:90%
in the aura, in the being.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, plus one
more, is influence of music.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It was classical music
by that time always.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Plus movement.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, conducting
orchestra, it's very hard,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:90%
physical work.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's amazing.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So
those are people who

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:84%
had very active mind,
because they had to remember

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:90%
by heart big, big symphonies.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know conductors
who are having

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.820 align:middle line:84%
this, like our Gergiev in
Russia, in St. Petersburg.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
He is conducting
without any scripts.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.390 align:middle line:90%
He just remember everything.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why activity of
mind, all the physical activity,

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.978 align:middle line:90%
plus, of course, music.

00:21:43.978 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And plus music.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you were
to look at that scale,

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
what would be more down toward
the bottom part of the scale

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:90%
in lifespan?

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, and
then, of course, musicians.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, musicians.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.145 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Along with
musicians, again, they are--

00:21:54.145 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:90%
have very high--

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I totally
believe that.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Then scientists.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see,
scientists, even in middle time,

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.903 align:middle line:84%
village time, they had a quite
long lifepsan, of course.

00:22:03.903 --> 00:22:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Makes sense because
the mind is driving forward,

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.115 align:middle line:90%
active and engaged.

00:22:07.115 --> 00:22:08.198 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:22:08.198 --> 00:22:09.335 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:09.335 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
all other professionals,

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:90%
they are less and less and less.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's clear.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:84%
We now understand
what we should do

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
to be healthy, wealthy,
[CHUCKLES] and live long life.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:21.976 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And wise.

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:23.762 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, and
wise, absolutely.

00:22:23.762 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's go
over into-- go kind of back

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:84%
where I was going about
with the modern influences,

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and the notion that
so many people seem

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
to display so much chronic
illness, even in young kids.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.658 align:middle line:84%
It's just, it's not
age related anymore.

00:22:37.658 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about the
influence not only of

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:10%
the toxins which we've
touched on, but also RF, EMF,

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:10%
and the general spectrum of
radio frequencies and microwave

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:10%
frequencies in our lives.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah, you
mentioned allergy.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.745 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And there
are more and more

00:22:54.745 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:84%
allergy for kids, for
young people, then why?

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we lost contact
with nature, because, again,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:84%
we should mention
microbiome in our body.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
essence of everything

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that we have in our
body, because we eat.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Then these microbes,
the bacteria,

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:90%
they design everything.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:90%
And they send us what we need.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So in after maybe '60s,
it was total change

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:90%
of this environment.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:90%
And we came from nature.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:84%
We came to more and more
artificial environment,

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.790 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
we have artificially

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:90%
grown vegetables and fruits.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Only now we have
organic, slowly.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:84%
We had for long decades
meat that was fed--

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.780 align:middle line:84%
was antibiotics
and growth factors.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:90%
And we consume this.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
We have chicken
that was grown up

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:90%
in very artificial conditions.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Antibiotics
and same thing, yeah.

00:23:54.335 --> 00:23:55.293 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:23:55.293 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So and it all had
epigenetic inference.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So it came from one generation
to next generations.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So that is why now it's
clear shown, clearly shown.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I can give a very
simple example.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:10%
We have in far north of
Russia, we have Karelia.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:10%
It is area with all the
forests, beautiful forest with--

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.100 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Karelia?

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: Karelia,
yes, yes, yes.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, where
is that in Russia?

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.675 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: You
see, if you look,

00:24:18.675 --> 00:24:21.320 align:middle line:10%
partly Karelia belongs to
Finland, partly to Russia.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so it's
on the far western side.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.852 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
far north, yes, yes.

00:24:24.852 --> 00:24:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And those are same type
of people living there

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.250 align:middle line:90%
for centuries.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But some of them
live in Finland.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Some of them live in Russia.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:84%
In Finland, they have
very well-organized life,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.330 align:middle line:84%
very high status of life, very
well organized, very good food,

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
everything, because Finland
is very well kept country.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:84%
In Russia, people
mostly live on there

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
what they can get from
their vegetable gardens,

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:84%
from the forest,
because they have

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:84%
practically no job over
there, no salary, very

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:90%
little pensions.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little economy, almost
no economy to support them.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.954 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:24:59.954 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Economy is very poor there.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so
you live off the land.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.987 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:25:02.987 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So it was big study done
by one university that

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle line:84%
was comparing children in
Finnish and Russian part

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:90%
of Karelia.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Same genetic population,
but in Finland, children

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:90%
have allergy problems, diabetes.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Allergies, diabetes.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: All typical
for Western society.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.307 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:23.307 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: In Russia,
they are healthy, you see?

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: They
have nothing of this.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yeah.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, because--

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it makes
total sense, of course.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that,

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:90%
because you can measure this.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what's happening

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:84%
with those children
in Russia, the people,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:84%
when you have your
fingers in the dirt,

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.138 align:middle line:84%
when you're out
under the sun, when

00:25:40.138 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
you're breathing in the
energy of trees and so forth.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.957 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:25:43.957 --> 00:25:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So the more we
communicate with nature,

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:84%
the more we open to
energy coming from nature,

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:90%
the more healthy we are.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why one of the
obligatory condition of health

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:90%
is just walking around.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And the best, of course,
if in the morning

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
you can walk around,
you can look to sun,

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:90%
you can look around.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And then it's very
important for health.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:84%
You see, every morning,
being here in United States,

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:90%
in Colorado, I like to joggle.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I like to use bicycle
and just walk around.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.672 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so I take an hour
outside every morning.

00:26:16.672 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An hour,
OK, that's good.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
I wake up at 6:00.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:90%
And then at 7:00, I go there.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And then I see how
many people here in Boulder,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.710 align:middle line:90%
in Colorado, they are jogging.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:90%
They're using bicycles.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.718 align:middle line:90%
They're walking around.

00:26:28.718 --> 00:26:30.220 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why, you
know, Boulder was

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.398 align:middle line:84%
accepted as the most healthy
city in United States.

00:26:34.398 --> 00:26:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe that.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.150 align:middle line:90%
People are super active here.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way of living.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.358 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:26:39.358 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Same, I've seen in China.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:84%
When you travel in China,
when you go in the morning

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to any park, any garden, you
see people doing exercise.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And at night, you
see people dancing of different

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
age--

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.300 align:middle line:84%
young people,
middle-aged people,

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:90%
and very old people as well.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.533 align:middle line:84%
Dancing, for me, that would
be the preferred activity.

00:27:00.533 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Of course.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But look
at, it's dying.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:90%
It's dying here.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, there used to-- even
discotheques, all of that,

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:84%
from when people
used to get together

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
in the community and
dance on a Saturday night

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.625 align:middle line:84%
and all, that's all
gone, for the most part.

00:27:14.625 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Then it turned
into discotheques.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Most of that is gone now.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to the California
State Fair a few days ago.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, come
to our silent disco.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So now it looks like
everybody's having seizures.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a headset on.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:84%
They're listening to
different channels of music

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.905 align:middle line:84%
and just standing around
in a warehouse like this.

00:27:35.905 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And it's
like, it's better.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:38.800 align:middle line:90%
At least it's movement.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.758 align:middle line:84%
But that's kind of the
last time I'd been dancing.

00:27:41.758 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.467 align:middle line:84%
That's very strange,
very strange.

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:46.213 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was very strange.

00:27:46.213 --> 00:27:48.130 align:middle line:84%
We were doing that and
kind of looking around.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.367 align:middle line:90%
And we felt so stupid.

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
yes, yes, absolutely.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it is
one of many factors

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:90%
that influence modern society.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.913 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because we
understand it's total

00:27:57.913 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
transformation of the
social life due to internet,

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.710 align:middle line:90%
due to mass media, due to mass--

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:90%
all this stuff.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People are binging
on Netflix instead of

00:28:06.625 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:90%
out dancing and connecting.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.417 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:28:09.417 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately, people
damage their own health.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So instead of going for some
activity, a lot of people,

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:84%
they just sit nearby
computer, nearby TV.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they spend
their time for this

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:90%
or in totally stupid manner.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:25.022 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: So we understand.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:90%
We know this.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of the most
dangerous influence

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:84%
we have from our
technologies to society.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
the social effect.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
What about the
influence of those

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:84%
frequencies themselves
in our house--

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.433 align:middle line:84%

such-- on our microbiome?

00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Mm-hm, you
see, again, we are clear.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And we know that now
it was a lot of study

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
that all those frequencies,
they influence health.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.010 align:middle line:84%
With Bio-Well, we
demonstrate it very easy.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:84%
We take measurement,
just result anything.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And then people
call on the phone.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:90%
We repeat measurement.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
We immediately see deterioration

the duration of all parameters.

where we can't get results.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm asking because I know
many times people have come

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.560 align:middle line:84%
on our shows and
said, oh, you know,

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.640 align:middle line:84%
this is really devastating
to human health.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But there does seem to be
this highly adaptive factor

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:90%
about all biological systems.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
are that, right?

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:06.947 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV:
Absolutely, but still,

00:30:06.947 --> 00:30:08.500 align:middle line:84%
we need to follow
some regulations.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Don't keep mobile
phone nearby your head.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
go to cell phones.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.440 align:middle line:84%
That's something we
need to talk about.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.315 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolute.

00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, we need to
use cell phones, no doubt.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But there are several
simple regulations.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.960 align:middle line:84%
First of all, don't keep
cell phone nearby your head.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.663 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to
use a loudspeaker.

00:30:25.663 --> 00:30:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the speaker, yeah.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: It's possible,
yes, to use some earphones.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's not just to keeping
mobile device nearby your head.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So don't keep it nearby your
liver and nearby your heart.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, no--
don't keep it in pockets.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.835 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, so don't--

00:30:42.835 --> 00:30:44.283 align:middle line:90%
or just somewhere else.

00:30:44.283 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about me keeping
it in their pants pockets?

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Is that having some
effect on fertility?

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Of course.

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's my understanding.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Sure, sure.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely sure.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.203 align:middle line:90%
So it's very simple.

00:30:52.203 --> 00:30:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Then don't put your mobile phone
nearby your bed when you sleep.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Just
forget about this.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Put it in somewhere other room,
because even if people keep it,

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
subconsciously,
they are on alert.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, maybe someone will call.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:90%
And they can wake up at night.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, who is it?

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Who is-- what's message I have?

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So we understand for
99.999% of people,

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.570 align:middle line:84%
if they can miss some call
at night, nothing happens.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But it makes them
much more healthier.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, most
dangerous, most vulnerable

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.850 align:middle line:84%
is also children
and pregnant ladies.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because the
brain of people under even

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.930 align:middle line:84%
in their 20s is
still developing.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have increase of
brain cancer for children.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.255 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's terrible.

00:31:40.255 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: It's a big
problem, because it's clear.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:90%
This is the reason.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.015 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
on cell phones.

00:31:45.015 --> 00:31:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are there--
you know, there

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:84%
are many people that
sell little devices.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Just stick this on the
back of the cell phone.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.490 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to take care of
all the negative frequencies

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:53.290 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:54.750 align:middle line:90%
What do you find to be true?

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Are there some technologies
that are good this way?

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:59.310 align:middle line:90%
With Bio-Well, we can check it.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.110 align:middle line:90%
And a whole study.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:84%
We need to check whether
it's good or not.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, in just
to our conference,

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.580 align:middle line:84%
it was big presentation
from Germany.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From who?

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: From Germany.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:09.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Germany?

00:32:09.485 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.842 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, one
scientist from Germany.

00:32:11.842 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:84%
They made tests on
different systems like this.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And they
found two of them

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.343 align:middle line:84%
from maybe 15 that
are really efficient.

00:32:20.343 --> 00:32:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
tell us what they are?

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Because our viewers are going
to be saying, what are they?

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.180 align:middle line:90%
I want one.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Uh-huh,
it's a Swiss production.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Swiss?

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, Swiss.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's one--

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it called--
what's it called?

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.382 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Seems to me
it's called Safe Mobile--

00:32:35.382 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:90%
something of this kind.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Safe Mobile, a Swiss--

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A Swiss product.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.503 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:32:39.503 --> 00:32:40.353 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:40.353 --> 00:32:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And they
sell it, of course.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And it was really tested.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was found that it
really protects from inference.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anything else
besides the Swiss offering?

00:32:49.465 --> 00:32:50.265 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No.

00:32:50.265 --> 00:32:52.180 align:middle line:84%
You see, of course,
maybe it's different.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.820 align:middle line:90%
But we need to test everything.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And what's good, with Bio-Well,
we can easily test it.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.770 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: So you can use
mobile phone without this

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.110 align:middle line:10%
and see effect, and then
use it and see whether it

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.640 align:middle line:10%
will be same effect or not.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.790 align:middle line:10%
So it's very easy.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:06.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now that we're looking
at the energetic effects,

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.813 align:middle line:90%
we've talked about nature.

00:33:11.813 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about our guts.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, do these RF frequencies
and such affect the bacteria?

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:84%
If we really are this
massive biological community

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:90%
of bugs of all kinds--

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.350 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I've even read that
the human DNA is only about 10%

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.390 align:middle line:84%
of our body when you add
all the different bugs

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:90%
and such into the story.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Are they affected by all of
the RF and EMF frequencies

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.540 align:middle line:90%
around us?

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:36.665 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, of course.

00:33:36.665 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
We understand that we are,
every cell of our body,

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:90%
has its own consciousness.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Every-- not to
talk about bacteria source.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So every cell response,
because every cell

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.860 align:middle line:84%
is living entity
that, of course,

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.630 align:middle line:90%
communicate with environment.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.900 align:middle line:84%
We have very clear
proof now that

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:84%
without electromagnetic
field, life is impossible.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:90%
It was very clear demonstrated.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:90%
So we need this.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The natural
electromagnetic field.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.867 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, natural
electromagnetic field, yes.

00:34:07.867 --> 00:34:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So it should be
always a balance.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.109 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: We understand
that without this, it's bad.

00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.909 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: When it's too
much, it's bad as well.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.719 align:middle line:84%
So we need to find this
balance in between.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Little sweet spot.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're talking
about is very practical.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Keep the cell phone away.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe turn off your
router at night,

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.830 align:middle line:90%
you know, your Wi-Fi at night.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Just make your house
as energetically

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.429 align:middle line:84%
quiet as possible at
night when you sleep.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:29.229 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:34:29.229 --> 00:34:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Plus, of course, in your home,
in your bedroom in particular,

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:34.219 align:middle line:84%
you need to have very
quiet conditions, I mean,

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.339 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetically quiet.

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:36.139 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So if people
have some antenna just nearby

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:84%
there or on the roof,
then, of course,

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.860 align:middle line:84%
it may be dangerous,
very dangerous.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.779 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what about
apartment buildings?

00:34:44.779 --> 00:34:45.579 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Again--

00:34:45.579 --> 00:34:48.199 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The stuff's passing
through everyone's apartments.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:49.157 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:34:49.157 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:84%
We need to-- it's possible
to test what's going on.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.699 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And now, there
are different meters even

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:54.830 align:middle line:90%
on a mobile phone.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:57.680 align:middle line:84%
You can download a
app where it shows you

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.950 align:middle line:90%
the level of electromagnetics.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:01.375 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And then,
of course, people

00:35:01.375 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:84%
need to think what
should be done.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a lot
of means of protection,

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.150 align:middle line:90%
individual protection.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:10%
The easiest and the simplest
way is just grounding your bed.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:13.710 align:middle line:10%
You know this.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:16.293 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How do you-- what do
you mean by grounding your bed?

00:35:16.293 --> 00:35:19.770 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: There are a company,
they produce conductive layers

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:23.210 align:middle line:10%
that people put on the
sheets and ground them.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And then it helps a lot.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you
talking about kind

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:25.870 align:middle line:90%
of the earthing technologies?

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.578 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes,
yes, yes, this type

00:35:27.578 --> 00:35:29.790 align:middle line:84%
of earthing
technology, because it

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:84%
was shown that a lot
of clinical symptoms

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.507 align:middle line:84%
may be just diminished
by using earthing.

00:35:36.507 --> 00:35:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, we get into
the whole other area

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that people-- is very
confusing for people,

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's the notion
of supplementation.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So we say, OK, so our microbiome
may be compromised because

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.870 align:middle line:84%
of the toxins in
our diet, because

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.500 align:middle line:84%
of the EMF frequencies running
through our apartment building

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.300 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to take supplements
and take care of that.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.080 align:middle line:84%
From our point of
view, supplements

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.280 align:middle line:84%
are obligatory for health,
because we understand,

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:90%
our food is not enough.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't contain enough of
minerals, supplements, and--

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.780 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly devoid
of that, yeah.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.488 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: --amino
acids, yes, yes, yes.

00:36:13.488 --> 00:36:16.716 align:middle line:84%
Plus, of course, with time,
with age, we deteriorating.

00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:18.900 align:middle line:90%
It's clear, no doubt.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So that is why
using supplements,

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.860 align:middle line:90%
it is very important.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And in our medicine, in--

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.260 align:middle line:84%
known to us, doctors of
integrative medicine,

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.805 align:middle line:84%
they all use
different supplements.

00:36:30.805 --> 00:36:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you need
to find a good one.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:36.060 align:middle line:84%
You need to consult some
professional what you need.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.500 align:middle line:90%
It's necessary to make analysis.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.690 align:middle line:90%
For example, we are--

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.920 align:middle line:84%
with my wife, we
do our blood tests

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:84%
on a regular basis,
every half a year.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And we see what's
going on, and we

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:84%
see what we need at
the particular moment.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we used some
herb supplements.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.300 align:middle line:90%
And then we balance our body.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So we know what obligatory for
everybody-- some B complex,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.380 align:middle line:84%
some amino acids, some D
vitamin, because even with sun,

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.180 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people--

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of
people are deficient,

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:84%
a huge percentage of the
population, in vitamin D3.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, when
you make analysis,

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.720 align:middle line:90%
you understand what's good.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Again, with Bio-Well, we
have some interesting way

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.885 align:middle line:84%
how to select
supplements for people.

00:37:16.885 --> 00:37:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.740 align:middle line:90%
So what might that look like?

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.860 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, people
take some stuff in their hand.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they hold
it in their hand, OK.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.270 align:middle line:90%
They keep it nearby their heart.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.192 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
measuring from one hand,

00:37:29.192 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and then we're measuring
from other hand.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, oh, interesting, yeah.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.783 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:37:33.783 --> 00:37:36.180 align:middle line:84%
This approach was developed
by Dr. Michael Borkin

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:90%
here in United States.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.870 align:middle line:84%
He is very high-level
endocrinologist.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.170 align:middle line:90%
He has his own company.

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.190 align:middle line:84%
They produce their own
stuff, and he has developed

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.958 align:middle line:90%
this system based on analysis.

00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes sense.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you
go for kinesiology,

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.332 align:middle line:90%
they do the same thing.

00:37:51.332 --> 00:37:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.165 align:middle line:84%
But this is like
objective measurement.

00:37:54.165 --> 00:37:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So it's
not depending on skill.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
no, I understand.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I understand,
skill and interpretation.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.865 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: I respect
kinesiology, of course.

00:38:01.865 --> 00:38:03.433 align:middle line:84%
But this allows
a lot of people--

00:38:03.433 --> 00:38:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has more
objectivity to it.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.183 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:38:06.183 --> 00:38:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So, again, with clever using
supplements, vitamins-- clever,

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.020 align:middle line:90%
of course--

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.902 align:middle line:84%
of course, we can
tremendously help our health.

00:38:15.902 --> 00:38:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about probiotics,

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.290 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
big one right now,

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:84%
to supply some of the
better types of bugs

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to the guts for the
compromises that have occurred

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.425 align:middle line:90%
in the modern diet.

00:38:27.425 --> 00:38:28.800 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel
about probiotics?

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.920 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, we had
our very famous scientist.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.740 align:middle line:10%
His name was Metchnikoff.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.590 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning of 20th
century, he was a biologist.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.420 align:middle line:84%
He was in a different
type of biological study.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And he always
thought that you need

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.850 align:middle line:84%
to use bacterias,
natural bacterias,

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:51.280 align:middle line:84%
to help your system,
digestive system.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And now we understand he was
talking about probiotics.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So we need to use
prebiotics and probiotics.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Prebiotics
and probiotics.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
yes, yes, absolutely.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And, again, we
should use it not all the time.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to have
it maybe every day,

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:84%
depending on condition
of your digestive system.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And we understand how to see it.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:84%
We need to use it
from time to time.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And if people use, for
example, antibiotics,

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.442 align:middle line:84%
if they use chemotherapy,
if they use some--

00:39:21.442 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chemotherapy, yeah.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: --serious treatment,
then it is obligatory.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To take probiotics--

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
prebiotics, yeah.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.018 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:39:28.018 --> 00:39:29.550 align:middle line:90%
So in Russia, doctors know this.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So all oncologists,
they prescribe this

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.670 align:middle line:84%
to people in parallel
with treatment.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.982 align:middle line:84%
So that allows
system to recover.

00:39:37.982 --> 00:39:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
about fermented foods?

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.148 align:middle line:84%
Because in Russia, Germany,
the Eastern Bloc countries,

00:39:42.148 --> 00:39:44.315 align:middle line:84%
they're much more popular
than in the United States.

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Of course.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.002 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, and even Asia.

00:39:46.002 --> 00:39:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that, because--

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.418 align:middle line:84%
and I know there's
something going on right now

00:39:49.418 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
where they're working
with really pristine herbs

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and starting to ferment
these pristine herbs

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.700 align:middle line:90%
into some natural remedies.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.440 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an
interesting idea.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Talk to us about fermentation.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see,
again, we have tradition

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.710 align:middle line:90%
of fermented food in Russia.

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:07.713 align:middle line:84%
And people been using
it for centuries.

00:40:07.713 --> 00:40:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And still, it's very,
very popular practically

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.800 align:middle line:90%
in every house.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.940 align:middle line:84%
We have same tradition in
Korea, same tradition in Japan.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And look, the
highest lifespan people

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:20.710 align:middle line:90%
have in Japan.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Very high in Korea.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Very high in France.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.188 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, France
kind of throws me.

00:40:29.188 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:90%
But why in France?

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.505 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because they
drink a lot of wine.

00:40:32.505 --> 00:40:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, there you go.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Red wine or
white wine, not just vodka,

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.810 align:middle line:84%
not something of
this kind, because it

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:90%
is one more fermented products.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.802 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it has
resveratrol in it, too, right?

00:40:44.802 --> 00:40:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:45.830 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing
that's important.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you think
this is a really--

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Of course, we
need to be careful, because it

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:51.040 align:middle line:90%
has many other side effects.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: So it's not--

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it
should be organic, really.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, it
should be organic.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It should be in some
quantity as well,

00:40:56.910 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
so I don't ask people to
use a bottle of wine--

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:01.110 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.040 align:middle line:90%
--once a day.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.248 align:middle line:90%
Of course not, of course not.

00:41:03.248 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, everything
good when it's good.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So that is why now,
popularity of fermented food,

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.510 align:middle line:84%
it has tremendous
scientific background.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to have
healthy all our system,

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:84%
we need to use it, from
time to time at least.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Not every day maybe,
but from time to time.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So yogurts, even
though it's milk from animals

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, although there are
a lot of alternatives now--

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: You see--

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How about that?

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.357 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: --with milk,
of course, like that,

00:41:30.357 --> 00:41:31.260 align:middle line:90%
it's not so easy.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.468 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and most
of your yogurts in the East

00:41:33.468 --> 00:41:34.320 align:middle line:90%
are made with milk.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cow's milk.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Cow's milk.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's not so easy.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Plus, it is not only fermented,
but it has other additives.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I look to the shelf in
American supermarkets.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
find natural yogurt.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:90%
You need to look for this.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Most of yogurts, they
have some additives.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.940 align:middle line:90%
They have some sweetness.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And they, of course,
it has nothing

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.950 align:middle line:90%
to do with real product.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
natural yogurt,

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:02.365 align:middle line:84%
even homemade from, say,
grass-fed organic milk?

00:42:02.365 --> 00:42:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, of course.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:04.590 align:middle line:90%
We have natural yogurt.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:05.530 align:middle line:90%
We have kombucha.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:06.290 align:middle line:90%
That's very good as well.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yeah.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.927 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:42:07.927 --> 00:42:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have, if you carefully
look to this, you can find it.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But by and
large, you would say,

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.270 align:middle line:84%
try to get your fermented
food in ways other

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.900 align:middle line:84%
than through animal
product or milks?

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, of course,
we need to understand that most

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.550 align:middle line:84%
people, they don't have time
to prepare something at home.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because they
are-- we are all busy.

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:30.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you are clever,
have a clever attitude,

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.140 align:middle line:90%
you can find it.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Here, you have a lot of
supermarkets with organic food,

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.340 align:middle line:90%
with organic products.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.630 align:middle line:90%
So just go there.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, when with my
wife, we come to New York,

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:46.350 align:middle line:90%
we always go to Whole Food.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And we buy some products, and
we make our own breakfast.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:52.140 align:middle line:84%
We make our own
dinner sometimes.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So we understand
that is healthy,

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.750 align:middle line:84%
because if you go to
Manhattan, it's very difficult

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.200 align:middle line:90%
to find place with good food.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, but there
are so many good brands.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:84%
In the West, for
example, there's

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.387 align:middle line:90%
a company called St. Benoit.

00:43:03.387 --> 00:43:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are others that
use the type of cattle

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:90%
that have the A2 protein gene.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:09.840 align:middle line:90%
And then it's all grass-fed.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Everything's organic.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And even though I tend to stay
away from dairy as I get older,

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I find that I feel
great when it's

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:22.330 align:middle line:84%
that really high-quality
probiotic and a little bit

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:23.130 align:middle line:90%
of that yogurt.

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.610 align:middle line:90%
But we're also individuals.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people can't
take any of it.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah, because we
are all different, of course.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.838 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
we're so different.

00:43:29.838 --> 00:43:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And so people should
select everything for themself,

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.320 align:middle line:84%
not just to follow
some bus for everybody.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.778 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and don't you know?

00:43:36.778 --> 00:43:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, because
your mind becomes cloudy.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, of
course, we need to consult some

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:84%
professionals, because
we understand you have--

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:50.650 align:middle line:84%
people have their own way of
life, their own profession,

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:51.870 align:middle line:90%
their own occupation.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to know
what should be done.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not their concern.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But they need to look
for integrative doctors,

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.320 align:middle line:90%
for doctors--

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
hard to find here.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: But it's possible.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's possible.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And they are hard to find.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.073 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: It's possible.

00:44:07.073 --> 00:44:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Hard, but more and more,
it's kind of more and more.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hope.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And then to consult
what should be done.

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:14.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the best way.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm, yes.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:18.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, we were talking
about the microbiome

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.170 align:middle line:90%
and supplementation.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're talking about food.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.020 align:middle line:90%
I want to go into water--

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.910 align:middle line:84%
the quality of the
water we drink,

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:27.530 align:middle line:84%
structured water, what its place
is, whether we need it or not,

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.210 align:middle line:84%
reverse osmosis, all the
common types of water

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:32.790 align:middle line:84%
available for people who are
trying to be conscientious

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and not drink city
tap water filled

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.470 align:middle line:90%
with chlorine and fluoride.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.440 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to get into
the use of ozonated water

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:44.340 align:middle line:84%
to rinse and clean your
vegetables and fruits,

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.440 align:middle line:84%
because this has been
brought to my awareness.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.523 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolute.

00:44:47.523 --> 00:44:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So water is-- it is not
the essence of life.

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.710 align:middle line:90%
It is life.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:55.710 align:middle line:90%
We are filled of water.

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Every cell is liquid.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.230 align:middle line:84%
In all our body,
we have liquids.

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we
are what we drink.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:07.230 align:middle line:84%
You know that water
may be cure, and water

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:11.050 align:middle line:84%
may be deadly, depending
on the quality of water.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have very
clear understanding

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.040 align:middle line:90%
what does it mean.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Just recently, we
published a book,

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.520 align:middle line:84%
together with my
colleague and friend,

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Professor Voeikov from
Moscow University,

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:84%
"The Emerging Science of Water,"
where we presented main ideas,

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.600 align:middle line:90%
what does mean good water?

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.850 align:middle line:90%
What does mean structured water?

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:33.650 align:middle line:90%
What does mean memory of water?

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.260 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on
quantum electrodynamics,

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.540 align:middle line:84%
because we have this
quantum electrodynamics

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:39.990 align:middle line:90%
concept of water.

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's based on big research
done in different countries

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.880 align:middle line:90%
worldwide.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And then it shows us,
yes, water should have

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.690 align:middle line:90%
several properties for health.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:53.420 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it
should be clean.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the first topic.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:58.670 align:middle line:84%
If water filled with
chlorine, if filled

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.650 align:middle line:84%
with some heavy
metals, of course,

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:03.660 align:middle line:90%
it's not-- it's bad for life.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.480 align:middle line:90%
So we need to clean it.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a lot
of filtration systems

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:11.040 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to clean it,
not only reverse osmosis.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Then, even clean water, pure
water is good for health.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, it should
be some amount of minerals.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.308 align:middle line:90%
And, so again, we understand--

00:46:21.308 --> 00:46:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Reverse
osmosis essentially

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.210 align:middle line:90%
strips everything out, right?

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Including
the minerals.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.507 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:46:26.507 --> 00:46:28.290 align:middle line:84%
That's why I don't
like reverse osmosis.

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about the ones

00:46:29.915 --> 00:46:31.670 align:middle line:84%
you prefer and you
find to be-- what

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:32.260 align:middle line:90%
you feel are the healthiest.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: I can tell you
what we do in our home.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: We live in downtown.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.758 align:middle line:84%
So we have water with
chlorine, with some impurities.

00:46:39.758 --> 00:46:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: St. Petersburg?

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: St.
Petersburg, yes, yes, yes.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I have set
of filters, not one filter

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:50.540 align:middle line:84%
but a set of filters, that
comes through cold water

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and hot water, because
when we take shower,

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.490 align:middle line:90%
we accept water to ourselves.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we need to
have shower from clean water

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.910 align:middle line:84%
but not from dirty
water, not with fluoride.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Then those are first stage.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Then we have another
special filter for water

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that we drink,
for potable water.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
structural system,

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.270 align:middle line:84%
some structuring device,
that structures this water.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And finally, finally, we put
this water in silver jar.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And inside of this silver
jar, we keep crystals.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.770 align:middle line:90%
It is shungite.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.750 align:middle line:90%
It is silicone.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:30.780 align:middle line:90%
It's quartz.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's all filled with crystal.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And we keep this water, it's
just staying on the table.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And we drink from this jar.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:40.810 align:middle line:84%
This is-- allow us to
keep very good water.

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes,
I would think so.

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:43.940 align:middle line:84%
You've done your
due diligence there.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:44.898 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about it.

00:47:44.898 --> 00:47:46.520 align:middle line:84%
You say you have a
series of filters.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Is this just to filter
out the impurities?

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
all the filters,

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:52.790 align:middle line:90%
to get out the maximum amount.

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But how do the minerals
stay intact, then?

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because all those
filter is especially designed

00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.660 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So like one
that eliminates chlorine--

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:02.922 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --primarily and such.

00:48:02.922 --> 00:48:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Chlorine
and impurities.

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it allows
the natural minerals

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:06.760 align:middle line:90%
to come through.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, comes through.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very well
developed system now.

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So it's--
but, of course,

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.700 align:middle line:84%
you need to make
analysis of your water.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.890 align:middle line:84%
You need to see its
properties and then

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:21.330 align:middle line:84%
to understand what type
of filter you need.

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: But still to
keep natural mineralization

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:26.670 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, to
have structured water.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about structured water.

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.097 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: What this
means, structured water?

00:48:32.097 --> 00:48:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have this clear
understanding that water is not

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:38.150 align:middle line:90%
just uniformed system.

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:41.290 align:middle line:90%
It has some clusters inside.

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And those clusters,
those are big areas

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.720 align:middle line:84%
of molecules that are
in resonance positions.

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So structured water,
it means water

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:53.840 align:middle line:84%
with this type of
structured areas.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:90%
We name it coherent domains.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.224 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What--
coherent domains, yes.

00:48:58.224 --> 00:48:59.516 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:48:59.516 --> 00:49:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
special devices

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.960 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to create
the structured water.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Typically, those devices,
they use magnetic field.

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have many research
that demonstrate the effect

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.900 align:middle line:90%
of magnetic field on water.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.550 align:middle line:90%
They use crystals.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:19.700 align:middle line:84%
They use sometimes
different special shape

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.230 align:middle line:90%
of, oh, a geometrical shape.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we may have
structured water.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can you, again,
because people are saying, yes,

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:30.660 align:middle line:84%
but how do I know where to
find these, and what they are?

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.780 align:middle line:90%
And do you have any--

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.630 align:middle line:84%
are there any companies,
again, that produce these?

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.137 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, I know a
lot of companies in Europe.

00:49:38.137 --> 00:49:39.470 align:middle line:90%
There are some in United States.

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:42.435 align:middle line:84%
So-- but at the moment, I'm not
ready to give you those names.

00:49:42.435 --> 00:49:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: But it's
possible to find it.

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's out there.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you just have
to start looking around.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You start
looking to structured water.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And then you
find different companies.

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Then you need to
look what they tell.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: How they
present their research is

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.958 align:middle line:84%
very important, because
now we have a lot of claims

00:49:59.958 --> 00:50:01.000 align:middle line:90%
from different companies.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.195 align:middle line:90%
They claim this, this, this.

00:50:02.195 --> 00:50:03.830 align:middle line:90%
But where is the proof?

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: The
only proof that we

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:10.635 align:middle line:84%
can have about structured water,
about different devices that

00:50:10.635 --> 00:50:13.340 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to help
your health, it's

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.380 align:middle line:90%
scientific research.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.640 align:middle line:84%
If people can present
some research,

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.430 align:middle line:84%
if can refer to some study
done in some reputable place--

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:25.080 align:middle line:84%
in the university
or something else--

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.390 align:middle line:90%
then it's really reliable.

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.778 align:middle line:84%
If it just claims, then
it's a big question.

00:50:29.778 --> 00:50:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
then it goes through

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.198 align:middle line:90%
the structuring process.

00:50:33.198 --> 00:50:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And then is this
something that would

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.630 align:middle line:84%
be under your sink, that would
happen after the filters--

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --these
structuring devices?

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I'm just trying to
give everyone a visual of what

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.830 align:middle line:90%
we go through here.

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, typically,
it is some type of tube

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.180 align:middle line:90%
that water pass through.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A tube, yeah.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Some devices, I know very well.

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just some type
of disks that you

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:54.840 align:middle line:90%
put your glass with water on.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it allows to
structure this water

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.740 align:middle line:90%
after 10 minutes with light.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's maybe different systems.

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And in our laboratory,
we test these systems.

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:08.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's our regular occupation.

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And we do it for many companies.

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:13.387 align:middle line:84%
And then we present whether it
is really something or nothing.

00:51:13.387 --> 00:51:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can have it
as a tube of some kind that

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.180 align:middle line:84%
can contain crystals
or any number of things

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that go underneath, before
the water source comes out.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Or you can put it
into a container

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.523 align:middle line:84%
and then expose it to a
geometry of some kind, often--

00:51:26.523 --> 00:51:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --on a
disk, or a plate,

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.170 align:middle line:84%
or like Patrick Flanagan's,
all the little mini

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:32.690 align:middle line:90%
pyramids years ago, right?

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
things will also

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.597 align:middle line:84%
have the same effect of
structuring the water.

00:51:36.597 --> 00:51:38.513 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, this
is a way of structuring.

00:51:38.513 --> 00:51:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
different ways.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And some people put--

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so where does
the whole notion

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:45.480 align:middle line:84%
of putting "love," on the
side of the bottle, the word

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.787 align:middle line:84%
"love" come in, where
you're thinking of the-- you

00:51:47.787 --> 00:51:48.620 align:middle line:90%
have the word there?

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah,
it's always good.

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does that
structure it or--

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: But-- it's
always good, but it depends.

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.998 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: It depends.

00:51:53.998 --> 00:51:55.885 align:middle line:84%
For some people,
it may have effect.

00:51:55.885 --> 00:51:57.510 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it
may have no effect.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.370 align:middle line:90%
So I am a physicist.

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:00.968 align:middle line:90%
I believe more in technology.

00:52:00.968 --> 00:52:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, OK.

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:02.970 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:05.520 align:middle line:84%
All right, OK, so let's
go to the subject now

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.533 align:middle line:90%
of ozonated water.

00:52:06.533 --> 00:52:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking
into this quite a bit.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'm ready to jump in.

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And just washing the exterior
of all fruits and vegetables

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I bring in from the
farmers market and such,

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.440 align:middle line:84%
because they all have various
critters living on them.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And some may be beneficial and
maybe not to our bodies, right?

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see,
we understand now

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:27.150 align:middle line:84%
in modern agricultural
production,

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:30.820 align:middle line:84%
they have to cover fruits
and vegetables with something

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.840 align:middle line:90%
to preserve them.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.608 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not necessarily
on local farms and organic.

00:52:34.608 --> 00:52:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah,
organic is organic.

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Is different story.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's organic.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:37.200 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: It's if you know--

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But even organic
has its own array of bugs.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:41.295 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:52:41.295 --> 00:52:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK, so go ahead.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So, of course,
either you need to peel this.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Peel?

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:45.345 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:45.345 --> 00:52:46.845 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And so,
yes, absolutely.

00:52:46.845 --> 00:52:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And we peel a lot of fruits,
vegetables in Russia.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Or you need to use
some cleansing stuff.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And I hear ozone does a good job
if you soak it in ozone water.

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:58.905 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Very
good, excellent.

00:52:58.905 --> 00:52:59.910 align:middle line:90%
That's excellent effect.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:02.980 align:middle line:84%
We know that ozone has very
good effect on the water.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.430 align:middle line:84%
That's why it was in the, I
would say, expensive swimming

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.090 align:middle line:84%
pools, they use
ozone to clean water.

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: But this is expense.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So ozonated
water to clean fruits,

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.250 align:middle line:84%
vegetables before you use
it, it is very good idea.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So now we're taking
care-- we've kind of got

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:22.320 align:middle line:90%
this part taken care of.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
the field at large.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about the GDV device,

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.730 align:middle line:84%
because before
the Bio-Well, this

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:31.710 align:middle line:84%
was a very
sophisticated technology

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to read the fields of
everything, very subtle fields.

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to find out
what actually works and doesn't.

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I was going to tell
you that Melissa Waterman, who

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:46.080 align:middle line:84%
you trained personally
in the GDV use,

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.590 align:middle line:84%
did an experiment recently with
another technology called FLFE,

00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:51.750 align:middle line:90%
or Focused Life Force Energy.

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And, essentially, what
it's been developed for--

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:55.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fan of it.

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But what it's been
developed for is

00:53:56.730 --> 00:54:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to increase the coherence
of the field of energy

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:03.210 align:middle line:90%
in an environment, right?

00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to find
out more about that.

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.450 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what--

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.200 align:middle line:84%
but you have all these EMFs
and everything else in there.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.750 align:middle line:84%
What is the effect on
that-- of that technology?

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And she used your GDV.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And she did a study
of everything kind

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:84%
of screaming on, all the EMFs
and everything, including a 5G

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.130 align:middle line:90%
router.

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:25.540 align:middle line:84%
She was right next
to a 5G router.

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And so she measured--
it was interesting.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.520 align:middle line:84%
She measured the field
as it was naturally,

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.810 align:middle line:84%
which was in a spectrum, in red,
right, in your read-out in red,

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:34.860 align:middle line:90%
jaggedy.

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:38.040 align:middle line:90%
And then they put the FLFE on.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And the field reduced down
to a narrow band of blue

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:45.200 align:middle line:84%
in the blue read-out,
very coherent and smooth,

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.790 align:middle line:84%
like all the jaggedy
parts were taken out.

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So I found that kind of
profound in terms of--

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.380 align:middle line:84%
because I'd been
wondering about it.

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to kind
of see for myself.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.220 align:middle line:84%
There have to be other
technologies out there

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.490 align:middle line:84%
like that, that can help
make a field more coherent.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:01.783 align:middle line:84%
How do we do that
in our homes with--

00:55:01.783 --> 00:55:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, again,
you're absolutely right.

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:07.020 align:middle line:84%
There are now technologies,
more and more,

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.560 align:middle line:84%
that are really very efficient
to balance environment

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and to protect us from different
electromagnetic environment.

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So I know this
type of technology

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.410 align:middle line:84%
from Hong Kong companies,
from Malaysian companies,

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:20.745 align:middle line:90%
from Swiss companies.

00:55:20.745 --> 00:55:21.030 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What are they called?

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Is there a name of that
type of technology?

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:29.277 align:middle line:90%
They name it field protector.

00:55:29.277 --> 00:55:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Field protector.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we'd be doing
online searches for that.

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:34.873 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:55:34.873 --> 00:55:37.437 align:middle line:84%
And in Hong Kong in particular,
they use it even in parks.

00:55:37.437 --> 00:55:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.603 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:55:39.603 --> 00:55:41.480 align:middle line:84%
They installed these
type of devices in parks

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.750 align:middle line:84%
to balance environment,
because in one effect,

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:49.740 align:middle line:84%
it allows to decrease
of amount of mosquitoes.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:55:51.185 --> 00:55:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: That's, again--

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Practical use, yeah.

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
very practical use.

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:57.120 align:middle line:90%
So this technology exists.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It's really very
good, very efficient.

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:02.547 align:middle line:84%
And I personally use it at
home, this type of technology.

00:56:02.547 --> 00:56:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I do, too.

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:05.505 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And, again,
with our measurement,

00:56:05.505 --> 00:56:09.147 align:middle line:84%
with Bio-Well, with GDV, we
have some sensors for this.

00:56:09.147 --> 00:56:10.480 align:middle line:90%
We can clearly demonstrate this.

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.292 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:56:11.292 --> 00:56:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And
the most important,

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:15.450 align:middle line:84%
we can demonstrate
on human health.

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:16.533 align:middle line:90%
That's the most important.

00:56:16.533 --> 00:56:17.408 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:17.408 --> 00:56:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where the
beauty of your work comes in

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and what you have offered
with the Bio-Well.

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.875 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
get to anti-aging,

00:56:23.875 --> 00:56:26.250 align:middle line:84%
because this is an area-- we
only have about five minutes

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:26.620 align:middle line:90%
left--

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:27.495 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about.

00:56:27.495 --> 00:56:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But people just look for
Bio-Well practitioners?

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- how do they
find people that utilize

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:36.460 align:middle line:90%
the Bio-Well in their practice?

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.110 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, if
we look to Bio-Well.com--

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:40.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, Bio-Well.

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.300 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: --at
this site, we have

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.880 align:middle line:10%
map of practitioners who
are eager to help people,

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.680 align:middle line:10%
worldwide.

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:48.310 align:middle line:90%
All right, good.

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:49.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's all over the world.

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a global thing,
so that's good to know.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.970 align:middle line:10%
And same, we have a list
of our representatives

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:56.340 align:middle line:10%
in different countries,
particularly in United States.

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you can
address those people.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:58.700 align:middle line:90%
You can call.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.730 align:middle line:90%
You can email.

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And those people
will always help.

00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:04.470 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of people, all of
them, they use, of course,

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:05.620 align:middle line:10%
Bio-Well in their practice.

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.382 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Most of them,
they are in health--

00:57:08.382 --> 00:57:09.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Health services.

00:57:09.465 --> 00:57:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: --practice.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, services.

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:11.848 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
integrative medicine,

00:57:11.848 --> 00:57:13.350 align:middle line:90%
naturopathic physicians, yeah.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:14.517 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:57:14.517 --> 00:57:15.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's very easy to--

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bio-Well.com.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah.

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's just spend
our last few minutes

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:20.550 align:middle line:90%
talking about anti-aging.

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:22.110 align:middle line:90%
That's where you are right now.

00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And just kind of walk us
through the basic tenets

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:26.640 align:middle line:90%
of what we have to address.

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: OK, so to
make it very brief,

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.170 align:middle line:84%
now we understand
what should be done.

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So first, and the most important
topic, your brain activity.

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:39.330 align:middle line:84%
That's, as I mentioned,
scientists, musicians, they

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.696 align:middle line:90%
live longer, much longer.

00:57:41.696 --> 00:57:42.840 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Because they make
their brain active.

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And second, because they have
very good supply of oxygen,

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.423 align:middle line:90%
blood to the brain.

00:57:51.423 --> 00:57:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that would
require movement, though,

00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:54.390 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, that's require
movement and special exercises.

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:00.750 align:middle line:84%
It's require osteopathy,
because it all related

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:02.048 align:middle line:90%
to a condition of your spine.

00:58:02.048 --> 00:58:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
chiropractic and osteopathic.

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:05.257 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:58:05.257 --> 00:58:06.500 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.670 align:middle line:90%
They recommend it to all people.

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:11.140 align:middle line:84%
That's first topic and
the most important.

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that will
release the flow of energy

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:16.470 align:middle line:84%
to run probably along the spine,
because we all get kinked up

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:17.310 align:middle line:90%
as time goes on.

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.813 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Second, the
most important topic

00:58:19.813 --> 00:58:23.640 align:middle line:84%
is your level of stress,
your attitude to other people

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.050 align:middle line:90%
and to the world.

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:26.400 align:middle line:90%
It was big study done.

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was found, all elderly
people who live more than 90,

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:32.890 align:middle line:84%
they all have very
positive attitude to life.

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: To other people.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So they are very balanced,
and they have-- that's why.

00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is a key moment
for life, for living longer.

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Then, of course, food--

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:46.713 align:middle line:84%
we discussed about food,
about different probiotics,

00:58:46.713 --> 00:58:47.880 align:middle line:90%
about different supplements.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lots of vegetables.

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:49.825 align:middle line:90%
Clean your food first.

00:58:49.825 --> 00:58:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:51.597 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:58:51.597 --> 00:58:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And last but, again,
most important, movement.

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.840 align:middle line:90%
So we need to move.

00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.860 align:middle line:90%
We need to just walk.

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.120 align:middle line:84%
We need to go to swimming
pools, if it's possible.

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But the most obligatory,
10,000 steps per day.

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:11.520 align:middle line:84%
so 5, up to 10, 20 miles
if people have time.

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.178 align:middle line:84%
Bicycle, joggling, of
course, depending on age.

00:59:14.178 --> 00:59:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so cute.

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:16.380 align:middle line:90%
You call it joggling.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.060 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] I love it.

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.320 align:middle line:90%
It's called jogging here.

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But I like your way
better, joggling.

00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, thank you.

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, yeah,
so jogging, OK.

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:30.007 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking 10,000
steps is roughly 5 to 6 miles,

00:59:30.007 --> 00:59:31.590 align:middle line:84%
depending on a
person's stride length.

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: But
every day in the air,

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:37.205 align:middle line:84%
not to go to exercising
room and do it in--

00:59:37.205 --> 00:59:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's what I was

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:41.610 align:middle line:84%
going to ask about, because
the whole thing about gyms,

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I join them all the time.

00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:46.157 align:middle line:84%
And I never use them, because
I hate exercising indoors.

00:59:46.157 --> 00:59:47.115 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:59:47.115 --> 00:59:47.915 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:59:47.915 --> 00:59:51.320 align:middle line:84%
No, of course, when people want
to develop their body, most

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.610 align:middle line:84%
young people, they have
to do it, obligatory,

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:55.650 align:middle line:84%
because it is a way
how you can develop

00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:56.942 align:middle line:90%
your muscles, your body, and--

00:59:56.942 --> 00:59:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, for training.

00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:59.190 align:middle line:90%
This is real training.

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: But this
is a real training.

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.075 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: For health, you
need to go everything outside.

01:00:03.075 --> 01:00:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Outside.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And now you can walk
around in parks.

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:09.300 align:middle line:84%
You have different
training facilities

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.850 align:middle line:90%
where you can train outside.

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:13.750 align:middle line:84%
You can always--
it's best to go,

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:17.880 align:middle line:84%
to make it in the morning, when
there are some open sky, most

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.760 align:middle line:84%
if you have morning sun,
so this is the best.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is obligatory condition
of health and, of course,

01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:25.714 align:middle line:90%
long life.

01:00:25.714 --> 01:00:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you do it
on 5,000 steps a day?

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:29.130 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:30.713 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: [CHUCKLES]
No, no, no, no.

01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:33.800 align:middle line:84%
That's, unfortunately, we
know this now from experience.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.732 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a beautiful
loop I like to walk.

01:00:36.732 --> 01:00:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's only about
half the length

01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:39.395 align:middle line:84%
that you're saying
is recommended.

01:00:39.395 --> 01:00:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Twice.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Got this twice.

01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:41.683 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's so beautiful.

01:00:41.683 --> 01:00:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my gosh, past all
the horses, and goats,

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:46.793 align:middle line:84%
and talk to the animals, and
everything, you know, water.

01:00:46.793 --> 01:00:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
that's beautiful.

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:48.960 align:middle line:90%
But make it twice a day.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Twice.

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.698 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To go around--

01:00:50.698 --> 01:00:51.865 align:middle line:90%
true, morning and afternoon.

01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah, and
afternoon, absolutely.

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's very good,
because in the morning,

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
you have one
experience, one energy.

01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:58.290 --> 01:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: At night, it's
absolutely another energy.

01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of
the nature of what's

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:01.930 align:middle line:90%
happening with the sun.

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And our
relationship to the sun,

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.250 align:middle line:90%
and we should never forget that.

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:06.600 align:middle line:90%
That's the big battery, right?

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.767 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

01:01:07.767 --> 01:01:10.340 align:middle line:84%
This is our-- the only source
of energy on the earth.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do you do
a little sun-gazing when

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:13.170 align:middle line:90%
you're up early in the morning?

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Do you look into the sun a bit?

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
obligatory, obligatory.

01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: I can
tell one story.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.113 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: I am traveling
worldwide all the time.

01:01:19.113 --> 01:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm flying from one
continent to another continent.

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:24.940 align:middle line:90%
But I don't have jet lag.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Because, first of
all, when I fly

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
to another part of the
world, I switch my watch.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.140 align:middle line:90%
And a leave on this time.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- never think,
what time is there.

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm the same with you.

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:41.310 align:middle line:10%
And second, very
important, in the morning,

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.110 align:middle line:10%
obligatory, I go outside.

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And I look to sky.

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:47.910 align:middle line:10%
I get this sun,
because it allows brain

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:50.460 align:middle line:10%
to reorganize a
production of melatonin.

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And then if
melatonin production is normal,

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.090 align:middle line:90%
then you sleep normal.

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
You sleep your 6, 7, 8
hours, whatever you need.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you sleep in time
of this particular zone,

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
but not in the time
what you had the other.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no,
absolutely true.

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:09.640 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.390 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
really plugging back

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:14.550 align:middle line:10%
into the most natural
elements of life-- what's

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:17.510 align:middle line:10%
grown from the earth, consuming
what's grown from the earth,

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.550 align:middle line:10%
utilizing our
relationship with the sun,

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:23.250 align:middle line:10%
moving in our body
outdoors, through space,

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:25.830 align:middle line:10%
past all the trees and
whatever else you may have

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:29.430 align:middle line:10%
if you can get out to
nature or to a park.

01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I just, again, I
appreciate so much

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you've been able
to make it available to us

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
to see what the effects
of these practices

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
actually are on our
overall well-being.

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:39.868 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

01:02:39.868 --> 01:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
because, really, Bio-Well,

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:45.520 align:middle line:84%
it is the instrument that
allows you to make this analysis
