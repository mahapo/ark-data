00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN WARNER: I've
grown up in the middle

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.097 align:middle line:84%
of the military-industrial
complex.

00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I would do my homework
in the Pentagon

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.329 align:middle line:84%
when my dad was
Secretary of the Navy.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.940 align:middle line:84%
He was involved in
Operation Deep Freeze, which

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.800 align:middle line:90%
is still ongoing in Antarctica.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.500 align:middle line:84%
He looked up at the night
sky and he pointed upwards.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.690 align:middle line:90%
He just said space operations.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.582 align:middle line:84%
The Navy has lists of thousands
of craft, tens of thousands.

00:00:30.582 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Is there a bigger version of
the Flugelrad with the BMW jet

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:90%
engines?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:90%
He was like no

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: No.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: No.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Look, this is the one thing
you need to leave alone.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
They'll keep doing this new
disclosure, which isn't new

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: But they'll let
out a few things because it's

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:90%
like a pressure release valve.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Then five years
goes down the line,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure we have a moon base.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't seen Chris
in a long time.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:90%
I knew his--

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Chris
Mellon, your cousin.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And I said even
if 10% of the wild stuff,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:84%
as you call it, is true, it's
astounding and horrifying.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And then it was clear
to me that the things

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that I'd be exposed to all my
life, all these things, now it

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:90%
got real.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.387 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: As many
of you know, 2021

00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:10%
is the year when our
government was supposed

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.803 align:middle line:10%
to have informed us
of their knowledge

00:01:24.803 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:10%
and experience of UFOs.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
This is taking place 20
years after what I still

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
consider to be the
real disclosure

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:90%
event led by Dr. Steven Greer.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Some new faces have
entered the scene

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:84%
while old agendas continue
to be perpetuated.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
with John Warner, IV

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.597 align:middle line:84%
today about his family's
piece of this story.

00:01:43.597 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%
So good to have you.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the new
faces from 20 years ago.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.062 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Thanks for having me.

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact,
your involvement,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:84%
your understanding,
your curiosity of this

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
has been a lifetime's
worth of curiosity.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're uniquely
positioned to have

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to information
the rest of us don't have.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
However, his documentary--
Steven's documentary

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
that came out in response
to the government's release,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon's release
of information,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:84%
called "The Cosmic
Hoax," is the first time

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I've really seen you out there
in a big way in the UFO story.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So-- and there's
a reason for that.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your family
history, your father, Senator

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
John Warner, who was also
Secretary of the Navy.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And also MJ-12 enters the
story, Elizabeth Taylor, UFOs.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a wonderful
story-- soup.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:90%
I love it, soup of intrigue.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And also information, I think
is really pertinent today.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's talk
about your family history,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.967 align:middle line:84%
how you touched
with this subject,

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to talk
a little bit about your dad

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:90%
and his final wishes for you.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Sure.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.982 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of all,
let's talk about this.

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Your families are what some
of the people in conspiracy

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
communities and others call
the committee of 300 families.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.773 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: That is correct.

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Powerful, wealthy
East Coast families.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:84%
The Mellons, as in
Carnegie Mellon.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And the Warners of
Virginia, right?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Those are really--

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Well, the Warners--

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, my dad's from a
very middle class background.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:10%
The Warners are definitely
not committee of 300 family.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:10%
My grandfather was a doctor
in World War One, his father.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother is a
Stuart clan from Scotland.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you
are a Stuart, too.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.580 align:middle line:90%
They were by no means--

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were not wealthy.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: I don't know.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:90%
Middle class.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I was raised in sort
of with both parents having

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
both sensibilities
in that world.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But my mother was kind
of a hippie and a mystic

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.835 align:middle line:84%
like her mother was in
the late '30s and '40s,

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:84%
when she and my grandfather
would go to Switzerland

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
to meet the Eros conferences
with Carl Jung and all

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
the other philosophers and
theosophists of the day.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:90%
And they were both mystics.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:10%
Mary Mellon, she left my mother
letters and books and things.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:10%
I never thought much
about it until I really

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:10%
started drilling down on
metaphysics and the occult

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:10%
20 plus years ago.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, wow.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
This is what my
grandmother was all about.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:84%
But my grandfather, when
the World War II started,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:84%
he was at Fort Riley,
Kansas in US Army Cavalry.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.770 align:middle line:90%
And he was--

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Grandfather
on which side?

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Paul Mellon.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mellon.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Paul Mellon.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: He was asked to join--

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:84%
he had fox hunted with
General Patton and Marshall

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and Wild Bill
Donovan in Virginia.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they were all
buddies before the war.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty chummy.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And Wild Bill Donovan
asked him to join the OSS.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
They needed polished,
well-traveled, sophisticated

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.330 align:middle line:84%
They're going up against
the Abwehr and the Ostfront,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and the cream of the German
crop of intelligence.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:90%
And they needed the best minds.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Julia Child, Moe
Berg, the ballplayer,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Allen Dulles was a good
friend of my grandfather's.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And so my mother had that
dichotomy growing up.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
A military man and also
a mystic as a mother

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
just as I had a father who was
a military man and a politician.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very interesting
thing to grow up in.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
There was this two
differing balances

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:90%
that kind of met in the middle.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But it was
dysfunctional, obviously.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.315 align:middle line:84%
My parents divorced
when I was 10.

00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:28.115 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You told me off
camera that they would make

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:90%
you watch the news every night.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Every single night.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Asked you
to watch the news

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and then they'd argue about
it during the Vietnam War.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Oh, yeah.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your mother
being the pacifist hippie.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.295 align:middle line:84%
Your father,
pro-American presence.

00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Absolutely.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's not
surprising that they divorced

00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:90%
after many years of arguing.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean they became much better
friends after they divorced.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:90%
We were like, all right.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: But it was an
education for us kids.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:90%
They were careful.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
My father really-- we
were rich and spoiled

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:84%
but he always wanted
us to go to the farm,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and grow up shoveling shit, and
doing all these other things,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
and getting dirty like
kids do on a farm,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and understanding nature,
which my mother and him had

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:90%
in common.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:90%
My mother's a nature--

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
where she lives
here in Colorado.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when they divorced,
I would do my homework

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.120 align:middle line:84%
in the Pentagon when my dad
was Secretary of the Navy.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I really
enjoyed that part

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
of going with him on trips to
navel bases and over to Europe

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
starting from age
8, I think, when he

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:90%
was undersecretary and onwards.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was always
carrying his briefcase.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted that
education, by osmosis,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:90%
to just filter in with me.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And he knew I was a curious kid.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: He wanted you
to see how things work?

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.145 align:middle line:10%
>>WARNER: He wanted
me to see how

00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:10%
it worked by witnessing it, not
just reading about it or seeing

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:10%
it on television.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:84%
When he was Secretary
of Navy he was

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:84%
he was involved in
Operation Deep Freeze, which

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:90%
is still ongoing in Antarctica.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And I would look at the
top-secret briefings

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
on his desk, things like
that, and call the Pentagon.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.240 align:middle line:90%
I was a kid with my friends.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
I asked him about,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I said, what is so
special about Antarctica?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Why are we doing all
this stuff down there?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I can't
really talk to you about it.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, the Navy
is very interested in it

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
because the Russians
are over there,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and the Chinese are over
here, and the Norwegians are

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:84%
over there, and we need to
have a presence down there.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:84%
But as time grew on,
while I was 12, 13, 14,

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I finally caught him on
one night in Switzerland

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:90%
and he had a few drinks.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And I said, come on, man.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
Operation Deep Freeze?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, we need it.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
We're drilling out bases under
the ice for missile silos

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and submarines just
like the Russians.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a tit for tat.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Balance of power.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why Antarctica?

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Why not the North Pole
or closer to Alaska?

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- he
looked up the night sky

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and he pointed upwards and he
just said, space operations.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.845 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, well,
I was almost 14,

00:08:09.845 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, oh,
that's interesting.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Didn't think anything about it.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And then fast forward into
the late '90s, early 2000s,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I read Nick Cook's
book, he's a friend,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:84%
on the zero-point energy, and
the Nazi Bell, Hans Kammler,

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like-- and I had
read about the German

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
because I studied
military history

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:90%
at University of Virginia.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So I knew the Germans had
this base in Neuschwabenland

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.400 align:middle line:84%
and there was different-- oh,
they couldn't have done it

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:84%
or they could have
done it or they didn't.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But then I was like, well, why
is it so militarized if they

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.203 align:middle line:90%
didn't?

00:08:46.203 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
If the Germans
started doing that?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Because they had started
going down there in 1915.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And they
had many expeditions.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And so it made sense.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:90%
What is so special down there?

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:90%
We can talk all day about that.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, why don't
we just talk for one minute

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll go on with
the rest of this story.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
What did you ultimately
come to understand?

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: China
has five bases now.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:90%
We have countless.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And the Russians, I don't know.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's something mega
special about Antarctica.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just the
hole in the ozone,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and there's a no-fly
zone for satellites,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
They got to be-- they found
something under the ice.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.237 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Alien bases.

00:09:22.237 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Do they believe
there are, I mean

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
did you come to sense there
might be other types of bases

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Oh, sure.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Alien bases?

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: The stories, whether
it's a colony of an Atlantis

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
or it was a spacecraft,
crash zone--

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was,
it had to be highly

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
interesting to countries
around the world who

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:90%
could afford a base.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:90%
I think Turkey wants one now.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Goodness.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.518 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
kind of things you

00:09:49.518 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:84%
were learning just kind of
tripping around with your dad.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And we'll bring
up another couple

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:84%
that I learned
about when we were

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
chatting prior to the
interview in a little bit.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So your dad lived a
good life, a long life.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Oh, yeah.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He just died very
recently at the age of 94.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: 94.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
said there was--

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:84%
he had really a message
for you before he

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:90%
died that affected you.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Well, he and I--

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
when I was a racing driver,
I was in California,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.968 align:middle line:84%
and a friend sent me
the Majestic 12 files.

00:10:18.968 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
He said print them out
and show them to your dad.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And I had some UFO knowledge
but I'd never heard of them.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:90%
This is '93 so I was 31.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And he and I went back and
forth, months over this.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I sensed I was
as close to him as anyone.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle line:90%
He and I were best friends.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, hey, man.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.735 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one of
your constituents.

00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and he just
uncharacteristically

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
for him just said,
look, this is the one

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:90%
thing you need to leave alone.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
The rest of it, your curiosity,
and everything you know,

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:90%
military history.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:90%
That's all fine.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
This is something you
don't want to touch.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:90%
You need to let that go.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:90%
They've got it under control.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:84%
It's under the Air Force and
other three-letter agencies.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Don't.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.892 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you don't
know me very well, huh?

00:11:07.892 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm never going to let it go.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.320 align:middle line:90%
This is the truth of our world.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's all
I can share with you.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Over the ensuing years
from '93 onwards,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
we would have discussions
from time to time

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.050 align:middle line:84%
because I was in his
office and admirals

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:90%
would come in, Bobby Ray Inman.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would always ask them
about when's the Navy's

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:90%
come out with their UFOs?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were always very
forthcoming and saying, oh,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
we're very hopeful
that by year 2000

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:90%
we'll have some of that public.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell me
that because I was his son

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:90%
and I was a "team player."

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is, I
mean, Steven finally

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
went for it in 2001
but they had hoped

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:90%
to do it even prior to that.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Well 9/11 happened.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, 9/11 happened.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: That got shelfed.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And that's
when I really--

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
after 9/11, the debris,
there was not enough debris.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon hold was
not representative

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.115 align:middle line:90%
of an aircraft pilot.

00:12:03.115 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: I mean--

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It raised
a lot of questions.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's say building
number 7 right behind it

00:12:07.738 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:90%
or in front of it.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.367 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And when I asked
dad, I said there's not enough.

00:12:11.367 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The debris field is
incoherent and not--

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.030 align:middle line:84%
there's not enough
sufficient mass.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, I don't
want to talk about it.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it was clear to
me that the things that

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:84%
had to be exposed to all my
life, all these things, now it

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:90%
got real.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I think it got real for
everyone in the nation.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as you know, 9/11,
it galvanized this country.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:90%
We were one country.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:90%
E Pluribus Unum.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:90%
One.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Out of many, one.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:90%
And I saw that.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I was filming in the
south, my documentaries.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And the pickup trucks
all had We Love New York.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Now for dually pickup
truck in Alabama--

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.175 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: --to have
stars and bars and rifles

00:12:53.175 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:90%
and we love New York.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Out of character.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And they meant
it because we were all one.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:90%
For that moment.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.067 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And so
whatever factions

00:13:00.067 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:84%
were fighting with other
factions in the deep state,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
it did not have the
desired effect as far

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:90%
as making this country fearful.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It had the opposite,
like Pearl Harbor.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Although, it did allow for
certain types of legislation,

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.720 align:middle line:84%
certain types of contracts
to be shoved through that

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.515 align:middle line:84%
were not in our best
interest and we continue to.

00:13:18.515 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And my dad signed
off on the Patriot Act.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:90%
So did almost everyone.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like a
good idea at the time

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.540 align:middle line:84%
but what you just
said, the debris

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:84%
fields around the Pentagon
and these other things,

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:90%
there was an incoherence.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:90%
It was nonsense.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: There was a blockage.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's interesting
is they shoved the Patriot

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Act--

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.782 align:middle line:84%
we're not even supposed
to be talking about this,

00:13:42.782 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:84%
but they shoved it fast
through, so fast one

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
has to say it was
already written.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Oh, I'm sure it was.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so people
like your father signed off

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
on it even though
they're scratching

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.230 align:middle line:84%
their heads saying something's
wrong with this story.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Well, I think
he-- by that time,

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.267 align:middle line:90%
they didn't call it magic.

00:14:03.267 --> 00:14:04.850 align:middle line:84%
He said they call
it different, but he

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
was a liaison to certain
classified groups

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.320 align:middle line:90%
in the Majestic 12 sphere.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.432 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, I'm
in the intel committee.

00:14:14.432 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm Chairman of
the Armed Services.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I have to be privy
to some of that.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:90%
So I know about some of this.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And he would talk, we
would have conversations,

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and he could tell me
what he could tell me

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.765 align:middle line:90%
without endangering my life.

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you have to
take this extra seriously.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:90%
This is 2002, so it's post-9/11.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, well, this
is getting-- all this stuff

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:90%
is getting way out of hand.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:90%
And this is 20 years ago.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I agree with you.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.748 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't happy
about the Pentagon hit.

00:14:49.748 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he knew it was a
cruise missile or something--

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: --in
that vein that hit.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:90%
And I think we all did.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:90%
DC is full of cameras.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: It's like London.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: It's even
worse than that.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're down that day?

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Huh, give me a break.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: There's no--

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Give me a break.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And
everyone-- in my friends

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
who are either in the ONI,
or CIA, or in military.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:90%
This, that, and the other way.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.567 align:middle line:90%
They were all like, it stinks.

00:15:12.567 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It stinks.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:90%
From day one, it stunk.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:90%
So, there we are.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Your dad's kind of
caught on this one.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:90%
The country galvanizes.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back for
a moment to MJ-12

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.177 align:middle line:84%
and how they interface with the
subject of UFOs and disclosure.

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Well, I'll
go back to my granddad.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: After World War II,
we had our conversations when

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I was in my 20s, and I was
going to go in the Navy,

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about a career
in that when I was in college.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.045 align:middle line:84%
But life led me to
the racetrack instead.

00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have been a
good military officer.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't like authority
all that much.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I think, yeah, you think
too much for yourself.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But he and I had that sort
of male to male thing,

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:84%
which he was kind
of cold and distant

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:84%
to my mother and sisters, but
he and I had some brief moments.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I was
with Patton at the end

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
of the war in Czechoslovakia,
and this is 1985.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is way before we knew
about Kammler's operation,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:90%
SS E4 or Pilsen.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.630 align:middle line:90%
It was way before that.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know--
and I said, well,

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing with Patton?

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.577 align:middle line:90%
Because I knew about Patton.

00:16:24.577 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I studied him at UVA.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And he's bigger than life,
he knew about reincarnation.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Patton and Henry Ford
were vocal about it.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.722 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: They weren't hippies.

00:16:33.722 --> 00:16:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: With crystals
in their pockets,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
these guys were full
on right-wingers.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
Patton's a good friend.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
He gave me a framed
letter from Patton to him,

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:90%
signed and everything.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.665 align:middle line:84%
And I had it framed on my wall
in the '90s, and it was stolen.

00:16:51.665 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I was
with Patton in Pilsen,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and we went into warehouse,
and we were looking

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:90%
at all the wunderwaffe stuff.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Rocket works
V2, maybe some V3 parts.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
The Flugelrad with the jet
engines and other equipment

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.785 align:middle line:90%
transistors and all this stuff.

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
that's fascinating.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.555 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I saw
this big disk aircraft.

00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, is
that the Flugelrad?

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Is there a bigger version of
the Flugelrad with the BMW jet

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:90%
engines?

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:90%
He was like, no.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: No.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.033 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And that was the
end of the conversation

00:17:32.033 --> 00:17:34.432 align:middle line:84%
because his wife came
in and it was lunchtime.

00:17:34.432 --> 00:17:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was just a
college kid, and I

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.953 align:middle line:84%
was like, that's
really interesting.

00:17:37.953 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I knew a little bit about
the German high technology

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:90%
wunderwaffe at that point.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But then when I read Nick
Cook's book, I just--

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:90%
I nearly fell on the floor.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.213 align:middle line:90%
And that was like 2003, 2004.

00:17:48.213 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
people have read it,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
give just the
thumbnail sketch of it.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Well, he and
Igor Witkowski they--

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Igor Witkowski queried
people in east Germany

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and the Polish archives
and the Russian archives

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and found out all about the
trials of German war criminals.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And they had been talking about
the SS Riese Complex, SS E4

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and Pilsen, the big
SS secret operation

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:84%
where all the
money was going to.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I think Gestapo Mueller was in
charge of a three-ring security

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And all these things and no
one have heard of Hans Kammler.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Not much.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Always just a contractor.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, he built all
the death camps.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, I
have a great idea.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's implement a slave labor
pool out of all the prisoners.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:90%
He was the architect of that.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And so he was involved
with free energy research,

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
scale our energy
weapons, sound weapons.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:84%
All the wunderwaffe projects,
Walther Gerlach, Kurt Debus,

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
all the high-voltage
plasma engineers

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.072 align:middle line:84%
using nonlinear term
physics in World War II.

00:18:55.072 --> 00:18:56.197 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Plasma engineers.

00:18:56.197 --> 00:18:56.448 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:56.448 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.908 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: You know when I
read that book, I was like,

00:18:58.908 --> 00:19:02.130 align:middle line:84%
holy shit, this is what my
grandfather was involved in.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Because other people throughout
the years that know my father,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:84%
either retired admirals, people
who respect my dad, they'd say,

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I know you're interested
in this subject.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
You should know that
the Mellons family

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
has had 40 people in
military intelligence

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:90%
since World War II.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:90%
We're not a big family.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe 130 of us
alive at any given time.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:90%
That's a quite bit.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.218 align:middle line:84%
And so my grandfather, he
was close with Allen Dulles.

00:19:30.218 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:84%
He was on the Council of Foreign
Relations with Allen Dulles.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Allen Dulles was
in charge of hiring

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:90%
all the SS and Nazi guys--

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Project Paperclip.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: --during the war and
saying he'd need to come work--

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.045 align:middle line:84%
forget the rat line to
Argentina, come work for us

00:19:46.045 --> 00:19:46.845 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:19:46.845 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: So he was involved
with Project Paperclip.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:90%
He told me that, my grandfather.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And so as it turns
out, we got 5,000,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:84%
maybe some people say 10,000
former Nazi scientists,

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and contractors,
and engineers that

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
went into all kinds
of fields of banking,

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and engineering, and
aerospace, which is well known.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And so all these things
started to piece together

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:90%
very uncomfortably for me.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.590 align:middle line:84%
It was very interesting
but it was also--

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I knew a lot about the
Germans and the Nazis.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:90%
I know more of today.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I can actually claim
being a decent historian.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.187 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:32.187 --> 00:20:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Because you have
to have the imagination

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:84%
to view the whole
picture because history

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%
is a pack of lies.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
They tell us a lot about
wars throughout history.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the one constant.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Even skulduggery and the
monks in the Middle Ages

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.620 align:middle line:84%
working for the
Vatican, they always

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:84%
left all the wars
and conflicts we

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.800 align:middle line:84%
know all about Alexander the
Great and the Punic Wars,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:84%
not the positive stuff but
a lot of the war stuff.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
they don't skimp on.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:90%
They skimp on everything else.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:90%
The history is a Swiss cheese.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.428 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: The Hittites
were here somewhere.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
just marked by war.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our history
books are marked by war.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Wait a minute,
what about Zep Tepi in Egypt?

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep, no.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Oh, that's
not important.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.252 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: It's the
dynastic Egyptians

00:21:15.252 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:90%
you've got to focus on.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wait a minute.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And Graham Hancock, and Robert
Schoch, and Robert Bauval.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:84%
It all pieces together,
the history of it.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were you
were ensconced in this.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
You had personal contact
with family members

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.370 align:middle line:84%
who were in the know
on these projects.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So this brings us
to who you are,

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:90%
how you started out in this.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Your mother, you told
me that your mother gave

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:90%
you "Chariots of the Gods?"--

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah, when I was 10.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When you were 10.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Your mom--

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: There's a
picture on my website,

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm 10 years old with
long hair at camp.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And I've got it hidden
in a towel because my camp

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:90%
counselor--

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
this is 1972, so
before you were born.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.367 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:22:04.367 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: He was a
very religious man.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:90%
I knew him well, my counselor.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.650 align:middle line:90%
I knew him later on in life.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But he ripped this kid's
version in his hand and says,

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:90%
this is against God.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.035 align:middle line:90%
And threw it in the trash bin.

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:90%
So I ripped the cover off mine.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:90%
I hid it.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.343 align:middle line:84%
And I would go up behind
in the woods and read it.

00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the point is
you're ensconced in this,

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.218 align:middle line:84%
and you're ensconced
in military history.

00:22:27.218 --> 00:22:28.018 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:22:28.018 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm a "Star Trek" fan.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:90%
All of it.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So now that brings us up to
today and some pretty weird

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:90%
stuff going on.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean here, the people
that care about such things

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and have been interested
in following it.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
We're waiting for
this big disclosure

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.595 align:middle line:84%
by the Pentagon which was a
non-disclosure event, right?

00:22:49.595 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: You're
going to keep waiting.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to happen, and
it's a nondisclosure event.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because I was

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
on a disclosure panel with some
other men a few months ago.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And I remember Danny
Sheehan at the time saying

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.020 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to announce anything

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.307 align:middle line:90%
or it's not going to happen.

00:23:06.307 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:90%
You can wait all you want.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're now saying you
can wait all you want.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, they didn't.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
The only interesting
thing in that whole report

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:84%
was that they said there
are 144 cases they looked at

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't explain 143.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's actually
big in itself.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Forget it, just
leave it at that.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, it could be
weather balloons,

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.575 align:middle line:90%
could be optical illusions.

00:23:26.575 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: I can't believe that.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:28.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Went all
the way through down

00:23:28.815 --> 00:23:32.207 align:middle line:84%
to the same old stupid
stories to swamp gas.

00:23:32.207 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Swamp gas.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or, yeah,
it could be a UFO.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:90%
It could be something like that.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But the point is I only
looked at that one part.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't explain
143 out of 144.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So the characters
behind it are what's

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
really kind of interesting right
now because the UFO community,

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
the disclosure
community are basically

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.835 align:middle line:90%
cannibalizing themselves.

00:23:51.835 --> 00:23:52.138 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: I agree.

00:23:52.138 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This has been
going on for a while.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So Steven Greer, and
you take it from here,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:90%
you were in the film.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Steven Greer knew they weren't
going to release anything.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And Steven Greer, who our
audience is well familiar

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.600 align:middle line:84%
with, he's done work
here on Gaia as well,

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:84%
did his own answer to the
Pentagon non-disclosure

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:84%
in a documentary called
"The Cosmic Hoax," right?

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.780 align:middle line:84%
You were in it, Danny
Sheehan, others were in it,

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:90%
and then all hell broke loose.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So set it up for where
we are right now.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Well, I mean
I was somewhat hopeful

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:84%
when Chris Mellon and
everybody was came out in 2017.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:90%
I thought this is interesting.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are
the New York Times.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yup.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're the
conduit for this information.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.768 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: And through Greer--

00:24:37.768 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I actually I hadn't seen
Chris in a long time.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:90%
I knew his--

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Chris
Mellon, your cousin.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: And I said, hey, man.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.150 align:middle line:90%
How can I help?

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we've had several
meetings together

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:90%
in my farm and elsewhere.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:10%
The family reunion
and other things.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:10%
And I was like let me
help you because I've

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:10%
had this crazy life with dad.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And he knew my dad well because
he was part of that liaison.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.237 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.237 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Military intelligence.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:03.737 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: A group of people.

00:25:03.737 --> 00:25:05.750 align:middle line:84%
The military intelligence
in the Senate.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:90%
He was in that mix somewhere.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But no, he wouldn't
go off script.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, this is a mystery.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
in the wild stuff.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, even if 10%
of the wild stuff as you

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.250 align:middle line:84%
call it is true, it's
astounding and horrifying.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- we had a
private conversation, which

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:84%
will remain private, but he
did say people can't handle it.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:90%
The fear factor is a problem.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.878 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I agree with you.

00:25:36.878 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
There will be panic
and other things

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:84%
if things are released too
fast because it's overwhelming.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.238 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't agree on
what's the best way to do it.

00:25:46.238 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How they will
handle it publicly.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And so I've
been waiting for years.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I have
closely monitored everything.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was going to
be a nothing burger when

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.233 align:middle line:84%
they came out with it and it
was almost less than nothing.

00:26:01.233 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Less than nothing.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: But I will give
Chris and Elizondo credit.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.580 align:middle line:84%
They brought a dead
topic alive in 2017.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They did.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is important.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So it appears that
what's happened

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
is Lue Elizondo, who was
also in intelligence,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:84%
your cousin Chris Mellon,
military intelligence

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:84%
force the issue with
those three little videos

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.750 align:middle line:84%
that most everybody who's
watching this have seen.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Those little videos.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Now mind you, there
are thousands of them

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:84%
in archives of militaries
and private hands

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
around the world to say
nothing more than that.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: They're
more than that.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To say nothing of
even Jaime Maussan's collection

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.070 align:middle line:90%
alone which is fascinating.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.380 align:middle line:90%
And so that they exist.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So the public was drip
fed three little pieces,

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
which couldn't--
these kinds of speeds,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.230 align:middle line:84%
in this maneuvering couldn't be
explained technically speaking.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
pushed that were,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that pushed for it, this
release from the Pentagon,

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Danny Sheehan as their attorney,
is Lue Elizondo and your cousin

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:90%
Chris Mellon.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The problem seems
to have come when

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.380 align:middle line:84%
they had-- there was some
indication, particularly

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.550 align:middle line:84%
from Lue, that we have to get
to the bottom of this phenomena.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Look at what these
things can do.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:90%
They could be a threat.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this gets back to Wernher
von Braun and the Big Warning.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
You take it away from there
because nothing indicates that.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.205 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: No.

00:27:26.205 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
The things they talk about
have plausible deniability

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:90%
attached to it.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The Tic Tac is obviously the
successor to the TR-3B or G,

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:84%
you know, Black Triangle
from Lockheed Martin.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They'll fall back on
that when it's released,

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:43.510 align:middle line:84%
if it's released in the Space
Force in the coming years.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:48.240 align:middle line:84%
But this threat narrative
that goes back to Wernher von

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Braun in the '60s.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
He had told Steven Greer's
friend all about it.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:84%
America-- I've grown up in
the middle of the Military

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Industrial Complex in
Washington DC and in the Senate.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:08.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean everything is--

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.963 align:middle line:84%
the Navy and Marines,
I grew up with them.

00:28:10.963 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:90%
I really respect them.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.515 align:middle line:84%
They're beholden to
the Constitution.

00:28:13.515 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
They're the two branches
of the military that

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:90%
are holding the Constitution.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
I noticed earlier

00:28:17.988 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:84%
you said that the Air
Force is connected

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:90%
with MJ-12, for example.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Would you please--

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: I didn't say that,
but others have said that.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Others have said that.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Yeah, because the US
Army Air Corps was in charge.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're not
beholden to the Constitution.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force is
in the Army or--

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.978 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Not that I know of.

00:28:33.978 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
can become involved

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.480 align:middle line:84%
in kind of shadow operations
with impunity more or less

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:90%
if they needed to or wanted to.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.575 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Not that
the Navy and Marines

00:28:42.575 --> 00:28:46.810 align:middle line:84%
don't have their own private
black sections of covert stuff

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:90%
that goes on.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And the admirals
aren't privy to it--

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: --or the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:90%
That happens.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Unacknowledged special
access projects,

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:90%
you do not have access.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Or if
you're president.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're not
beholden to the Constitution

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.738 align:middle line:84%
that you know of in the
same way that the Navy is.

00:29:02.738 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: That's what
I've-- my father is--

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
really what your dad--

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: It differs.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: He always had the
Navy and Marines behind him.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.600 align:middle line:84%
He told me all senators and
congressmen are bought and paid

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:84%
for by special
interests, but he always

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:84%
had that solid
footing with them.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot of
admirals and military people

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.317 align:middle line:84%
respect my father because
he was a stand up guy

00:29:25.317 --> 00:29:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and he always fought for--

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.057 align:middle line:84%
Virginia is a Navy,
Marine Corps state.

00:29:30.057 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:84%
His name is on one of the school
buildings in the Marine Corps

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:90%
University which he got done.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.030 align:middle line:90%
I was very proud of him.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And so when people get up
like Chris and Lue Elizondo

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and then they say,
well, it's a mystery.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.740 align:middle line:90%
That's lying by omission.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And then they say,
well, we don't know what it is.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a lie.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they
do know what it is.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.450 align:middle line:84%
They've had a chance to
study this for 70 years.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
My ONI-- my best friend
is a retired ONI officer--

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:90%
US Navy Officer.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, no.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
The Navy has lists of thousands
of craft, tens of thousands.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Every shape and size
you can imagine.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the times they
know who's driving it,

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:90%
where they're from.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Not really sure
what their missions

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:84%
are, but maybe sometimes
their privy of that too.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But they've got
charts of this stuff.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So for Chris and Lue to get up
there on national television,

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.960 align:middle line:84%
they've got CNN, and
the Washington Post,

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and the New York Times
in their pockets--

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: They've
got the full weight

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Met, the mainstream
media behind them.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.708 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is modulated
by the intelligence community.

00:30:31.708 --> 00:30:32.998 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Absolutely.

00:30:32.998 --> 00:30:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're not shy
to tell you that.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're only going to
allow that much to come out.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:90%
What do you think they were--

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:84%
what do you think,
I mean, yes, it's

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.370 align:middle line:84%
great that it shook
the tree and it got

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:90%
people thinking about it even.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.382 align:middle line:90%
But what were they trying to do?

00:30:47.382 --> 00:30:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: You know I had a
conversation with a friend

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
last night and everything
that I've learned in my life

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and seen and things
that have been

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:84%
done since Vietnam forward,
because I know my Vietnam

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.145 align:middle line:90%
history as well.

00:31:02.145 --> 00:31:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.660 align:middle line:84%
The MJ-12 or the
equivalent, they've

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.330 align:middle line:84%
been kicking disclosure
can down the road.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Every 10 years they
debate it and say, nah,

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.162 align:middle line:84%
I want to retire
into the sunset.

00:31:15.162 --> 00:31:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The admirals and generals around
the table were like, yeah,

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:22.180 align:middle line:84%
we want to retire in the sunset
with our corporate investments

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.170 align:middle line:90%
intact and everything.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants to
shove it down the line.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.780 align:middle line:90%
And my dad agreed with it.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one wants
to have their name on it.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was like, oh, yeah,
they'll do that every time.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:90%
They don't want culpability.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
What I think personally,
what they're doing,

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Chris and Lue in this, and I
still think they're connected.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not on board with
the Danny Sheehan.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I understand reaching across
the aisle and for cooperation,

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:84%
but I'll go back to
Winston Churchill.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.790 align:middle line:84%
You cannot negotiate with a
tiger with your head in its

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.780 align:middle line:90%
mouth.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
These people represent
proto fascism.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not they're creating
a new space of disclosure.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.140 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
same old thing they've

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:90%
been doing for 70 years.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Project Blue Book.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.840 align:middle line:84%
What is Marco Rubio talking
about a UAP task force?

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.048 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: They always
come up with a task force

00:32:17.048 --> 00:32:18.360 align:middle line:90%
in the Senate or the Congress.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Unidentified
aerial phenomena."

00:32:19.945 --> 00:32:20.240 align:middle line:90%
UAP.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Right.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And then it just goes sideways.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:84%
The conversation goes
sideways, not forward.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But do you think
that there is still the notion

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to
stir up enough concern

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and fear as to pump up certain
budgets in the-- when you're

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.430 align:middle line:84%
talking about fascism, in the
military industrial complex

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:84%
like Eisenhower warned of,
Wernher von Braun warned

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.760 align:middle line:90%
of this time?

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.010 align:middle line:84%
They were going to keep
shaking that tree to get money

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:45.780 align:middle line:84%
for their buddies or
what's this about?

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: It's not about money.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why would they
still be perpetuating?

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: It's not about money.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's it about?

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: They've got
all the money they want.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Then why?

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: They've access to
funding streams from big banks.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Then what's it about?

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: People like my family.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:90%
What's about?

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: There's never been
a money problem for black

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.040 align:middle line:90%
projects--

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --those
kinds of projects.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: --extra
constitutional programs

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.165 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
have access to.

00:33:04.165 --> 00:33:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, I'm naive here.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.830 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to do?

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Within those programs?

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, with
this narrative.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Oh, with
this narrative.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:12.950 align:middle line:90%
I think they're--

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That the aliens
might be our enemy.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:84%
What I think is going
on, and I talked

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:23.610 align:middle line:84%
to about this last night,
is they're getting pressure

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.330 align:middle line:90%
from somewhere.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And one pressure is there
is a Great Awakening.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.725 align:middle line:84%
In the last 25 years since the
internet, I've seen a huge--

00:33:30.725 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.345 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: --amount of people, my
friends, high school kids come

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:90%
up to me and say, hey, man.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Do we have a moon base?

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, I
think maybe we do.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: There's that.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:90%
They know people are waking up.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.430 align:middle line:84%
They can't do
anything about that

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:48.287 align:middle line:84%
so they can only muddy the
waters with disinformation,

00:33:48.287 --> 00:33:49.120 align:middle line:90%
counterintelligence.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And fear.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Right.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And fear.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And the military does
exist to do one thing.

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And that is to fight wars.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:90%
And you know--

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.087 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
trying to now

00:33:59.087 --> 00:34:00.370 align:middle line:90%
justify themselves long-term.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: I think they're
trying to justify those black

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:02.755 align:middle line:90%
programs--

00:34:02.755 --> 00:34:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.028 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: --and things.

00:34:04.028 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.780 align:middle line:84%
They're creating a new
space for disclosure, which

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I think personally
is they're trying

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.292 align:middle line:90%
to normalize certain topics.

00:34:13.292 --> 00:34:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll move
five years down the line,

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, oh, yeah,
illegal funding streams,

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.239 align:middle line:84%
we had to do that
national security--

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Over to--

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: National security.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Sorry.

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Have a nice day.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Go back to school.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.989 align:middle line:90%
World Cups on TV.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And then another five years
they move it down the line,

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.415 align:middle line:84%
they're like, well,
OK, so we did this,

00:34:30.415 --> 00:34:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and we've got a moon
base, and we're on Mars,

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and we're mining asteroids, and
we're fighting some bad people

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:90%
out there and everything.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:37.659 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't tell you.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:90%
Back to school.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:90%
The NFL's on.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.210 align:middle line:90%
And who are your draft picks?

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And it's like
everyone's going to be,

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, there might be some
protests and people pissed off

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:49.690 align:middle line:90%
and then it kind of dies down.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:51.813 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: It's like 9/11.

00:34:51.813 --> 00:34:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was really
pissed off about it.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask a
20-year-old kid today

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.227 align:middle line:84%
and he's like, yeah, I
think I know something.

00:34:58.227 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I've heard something about that.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: You ask a 20-year-old
kid what's Pearl Harbor

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.353 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, well,
I think they taught

00:35:06.353 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:90%
us that in the eighth grade.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.495 align:middle line:90%
Something about the Japanese--

00:35:08.495 --> 00:35:09.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:09.295 --> 00:35:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And they
just don't remember.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the short-term memory
of the American people, they'll

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.900 align:middle line:84%
keep doing this new disclosure
which isn't new at all.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: But they'll
let out a few things

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's like
a pressure release

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:27.470 align:middle line:84%
valve on a high pressure tank
that's becoming overfilled.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:28.880 align:middle line:90%
And so they will--

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I think they're creating
this new space of disclosure

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:84%
with tidbits and lukewarm
intel and things like.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Gingersnap And lemonade stuff.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.945 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And they will like,
see, we're into disclosure.

00:35:40.945 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And then five years
goes down the line,

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.820 align:middle line:90%
sure we have a moon base.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.156 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:35:45.156 --> 00:35:46.677 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do about it?

00:35:46.677 --> 00:35:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you think
it is an attempt to--

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.677 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: National security.

00:35:49.677 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --keep consciousness
into a fearful independent

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.000 align:middle line:90%
state and mass.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.800 align:middle line:90%
To mitigate the pressure.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And so now Hollywood of course
has their own top down control

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.750 align:middle line:84%
to a large extent from the
intelligence communities.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And certainly over the last
decade or two, most of what's

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:84%
come out, it's not "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind"

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.400 align:middle line:90%
or "ET" anymore.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: No.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now it is
to scare the bejesus out

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:middle line:84%
of you with these massive
kind of android Nazi insectoid

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:90%
attacking Earth and us.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's not by accident,
that's by design?

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
everything about it

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.080 align:middle line:84%
has been feeding us and children
to be afraid of other, wherever

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.320 align:middle line:90%
other may come from.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Oh, it's been
going on since the '50s.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But there was that moment with
"ET" and "Close Encounters"

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.640 align:middle line:84%
based on apparently
Project Serpo.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
a little different.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: But "Star
Wars" was pretty violent

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.548 align:middle line:90%
and it came out in the '70s.

00:36:51.548 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that is--

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: "Star Trek" was fire
phasers first and oh, gosh.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: They sort of--

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was a
little blip in there.

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:00.900 align:middle line:90%
The violence aspect of it.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And so obviously, that's
part of the same machine

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:11.210 align:middle line:84%
that New York Times and CNN and
MSNBC is beholden to as well.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.140 align:middle line:84%
The Hollywood is
beholden to the same.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So this narrative that these
are potentially unfriendly-- you

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.980 align:middle line:84%
know everyone, even kids,
I talked to kids about this

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.988 align:middle line:84%
Well, how come they haven't
already killed us, right?

00:37:22.988 --> 00:37:24.030 align:middle line:90%
This is always the story.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Well--

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If they're so
advanced and their enemies,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:84%
why haven't they already done
something terrible to us?

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.132 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
even historically,

00:37:32.132 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
interviewing Freddy

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Silva in a couple of days
again, and Freddy talks

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.210 align:middle line:84%
about the presence of the ones
known in Indigenous tribes

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and around the planet have
names for these beings that

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.520 align:middle line:84%
came and helped them
after cataclysm.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Of course,
like the Dogon tribe.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Dogon tribe.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And same in New Zealand and
elsewhere, in Central and South

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.380 align:middle line:84%
America that have
these creatures,

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.800 align:middle line:84%
these beings that
came and helped

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.130 align:middle line:84%
them re-establish themselves
after natural cataclysms,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.970 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Historically,
they've always been

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.370 align:middle line:84%
written into the script
certainly indigenously

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.140 align:middle line:84%
as those who came to
help in times of need.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.190 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to indicate
this horrible scenario

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.220 align:middle line:84%
that Hollywood and now
even Congress might be

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.170 align:middle line:90%
trying to force foist upon us.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:90%
When is this insanity stopped?

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.557 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I write about
this in my books.

00:38:22.557 --> 00:38:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
your books a little bit

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to get to
that might as well do it now.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: They're satires
but they're dark satires.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:34.220 align:middle line:10%
It's about World War II and
a young British woman who

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:38.090 align:middle line:10%
was a pretty much a muck up
and screws everything up,

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:10%
but she's just a
humble-bumble, light warrior

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.110 align:middle line:10%
stumbling through
metaphysics and philosophy

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:46.860 align:middle line:10%
and fighting the Germans
at the same time.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little bit
of your mother in there?

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Oh, it's a little
bit of Liz Taylor, my mother

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:90%
and everyone I know.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
talk about Liz Taylor

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:84%
before we go
because this is fun.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: All that in it.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.520 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
writing my books,

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.820 align:middle line:84%
it was originally about
the German racing programs

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.720 align:middle line:90%
in "Little Anton."

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.227 align:middle line:84%
But this new book I just
finished three days ago--

00:39:06.227 --> 00:39:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the name of it?

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: "Lion.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Tiger.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Bear."

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: It is about--

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:84%
it is much shorter, it's much
faster paced, more intense.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But I don't-- unlike
other authors,

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to name names
who kind of wink and nod

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.990 align:middle line:84%
at the truth of our place in
the universe and ET visitation.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.190 align:middle line:90%
I hit the nail on the head.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll probably lose
a lot of readers.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.530 align:middle line:84%
It's really only disclosure
folks who will really

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:35.490 align:middle line:90%
appreciate my books.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Other people are like,
I just don't understand.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:43.400 align:middle line:84%
But I don't-- yeah, I
white wash, no fences.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.617 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wanted
to tap you on.

00:39:45.617 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: I talk about human
trafficking and it's like I was

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:90%
telling--

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.480 align:middle line:84%
the reality we're
living in now is

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
no different from
1,000 years ago

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.030 align:middle line:84%
if you go to a
Middle East bazaar.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: What can you buy?

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.775 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And the answer is
anything you damn well want.

00:40:01.775 --> 00:40:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: What has changed?

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.102 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
the back story.

00:40:09.102 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going on.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And that's
what my book is about.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.790 align:middle line:90%
And that, Amazon?

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Normal places?

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Book sellers?

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:16.434 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yup.

00:40:16.434 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:90%
It will be on Amazon.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.100 align:middle line:90%
I have a website.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Little Anton.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: littleanton.com

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.990 align:middle line:10%
>>WARNER: Dot com.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.
littleanton.com OK.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, we've got a
few minutes left.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to some
of the fun stuff

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.460 align:middle line:84%
because this feeds
right back into it.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So your dad's with
your mom, hippie.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going at
each other because they

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:84%
philosophically
not in alignment.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So then he marries
Elizabeth Taylor.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, they're
not necessarily in alignment

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.830 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:10%
What she was like, because
you actually knew her.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And then also the little story
about her own exposure to UFOs.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.550 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.808 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was
very down to Earth.

00:40:54.808 --> 00:40:55.720 align:middle line:90%
She was a great--

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.680 align:middle line:90%
she was really funny.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And they had that sense of
humor, and they love people.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:40:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:01.812 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And they had a
lot of things in common.

00:41:01.812 --> 00:41:04.060 align:middle line:84%
She really was
this great person.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Prima Donna, the
diva, absolutely.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.960 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of fun.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a
teenager, one night,

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I was with my best
friend, and she came--

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.850 align:middle line:84%
she and dad had an argument,
and she came home early,

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and we were having some beers
and maybe smoking a joint.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.495 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And we
were talking about,

00:41:23.495 --> 00:41:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, "Star
Trek" or something.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.830 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, oh, I love that.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.553 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a UFO when
I was married with,

00:41:30.553 --> 00:41:31.720 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Eddie Fisher.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Eddie Fisher.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Off the
coast of California.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.633 align:middle line:84%
And we were in a
convertible when this thing

00:41:35.633 --> 00:41:39.430 align:middle line:84%
went zigzagging up and boom
out there as fast as the USS

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Enterprise.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.960 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, all right.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my dad
came home and he's

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.670 align:middle line:90%
like, what's going on here.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:51.150 align:middle line:84%
He thought the pot was the
worst thing in human history.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:51.950 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, don't
be such a stuffy old goat.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Sit down and we're
talking about UFOs.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, oh, God.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.108 align:middle line:90%
Not that again.

00:42:02.108 --> 00:42:04.670 align:middle line:84%
He just really was
uncomfortable talking about it.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But she really, she
would dig into him.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:11.570 align:middle line:84%
You're being too stuffy and
conservative and all that.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.755 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
very interesting.

00:42:13.755 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And she and my mother
were good friends

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and they had that
metaphysical side to them.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.827 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:19.827 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: A lot of
people don't really

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:22.670 align:middle line:90%
realize that about Liz Taylor.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.010 align:middle line:90%
She was very open minded.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.090 align:middle line:90%
We just don't hear about it.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:26.900 align:middle line:84%
We're not privy to that
side of information.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:26.967 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: No.

00:42:26.967 --> 00:42:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They always talk about her thing
with AIDS and stuff later on.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And they always say, oh,
she's a diva and the perfume.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.090 align:middle line:90%
She had this side to her.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:38.230 align:middle line:90%
She was very intelligent.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And her memory was
sharp as a tack.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And when she sobered
up and cleaned up,

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I remember visiting her in LA,
and she remembered everything.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%
All the crazy stories,
being arrested.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I was arrested with her
in the Paris airport.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's for
another show, OK?

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: That was
for another show.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.960 align:middle line:90%


00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But she had that side to her
that was very open-minded.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:06.930 align:middle line:90%
She was very sharp.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:09.340 align:middle line:84%
She and I did not care
for the Queen of England.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't--

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there
is a photo where the--

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.807 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: The Mellons and the
Royal Family are very tight.

00:43:14.807 --> 00:43:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And going back to my great
grandfather, Andrew Mellon,

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:21.000 align:middle line:84%
my grandfather was best
friends with Queen Elizabeth.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.650 align:middle line:90%
They were horse racing pals.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And she would come stay with
him at his farm in Virginia.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.815 align:middle line:84%
So would CIA directors
and presidents.

00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:30.690 align:middle line:84%
They would meet out at
my grandfather's farm.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this is
a really busy place.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And he had tons of
security, ex-FBI men

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.100 align:middle line:90%
with machine guns and suitcases.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I used to-- they used
to let me fire them.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: When I was a teenager.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I bet they
served the best tea.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.862 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Yeah.

00:43:44.862 --> 00:43:45.820 align:middle line:90%
But it was interesting.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, he was very
cautious about his quiet image.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.993 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And this does
relate to Liz Taylor

00:43:51.993 --> 00:43:53.730 align:middle line:84%
because my father was
very disappointed.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.770 align:middle line:84%
When he married
Elizabeth Taylor,

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:59.580 align:middle line:84%
my grandfather came up to him
and said, we're best friends,

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.860 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sorry I cannot have
anything more to do with you.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.790 align:middle line:84%
This will bring too
much light onto me.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:07.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very private person.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.600 align:middle line:84%
You know that I'm still
working with the government

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in my own little
ways or whatever.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.260 align:middle line:90%
My dad said, I understand.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It's very disappointing,
but I understand.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And I remember him telling me
that with a tear in his eye.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was very
sad about that.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:24.090 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, Paul Mellon
and he were very close.

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they had a
lot of things in common

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.410 align:middle line:90%
with national security issues.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: But he understood.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Liz Taylor, at the time
she, was the biggest star

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.540 align:middle line:90%
in the world, arguably 1976.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Certainly.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And my grandfather
was just like stay away from me.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be--

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and of course, the press
would write about dad

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:48.410 align:middle line:90%
with the Mellons in it.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It must have driven
my grandfather crazy

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.360 align:middle line:84%
because of the Mellons
are very private people.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And this gives back
to Chris Mellon.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like I'm--

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He seems
like a kind of a shy--

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: He's very--

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:01.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sweet character.

00:45:01.823 --> 00:45:04.715 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Very conservative,
very shy, wonderful family.

00:45:04.715 --> 00:45:05.840 align:middle line:90%
They're really nice people.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And for him to get
at 64, or 65, or whatever.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:15.770 align:middle line:84%
To do this, he must feel
very strongly to do it.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to help him.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:18.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to come out--

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.610 align:middle line:90%
I like him.

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:21.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we were friends.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't email
each other anymore.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.720 align:middle line:90%
That's done.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.660 align:middle line:84%
But I take the total opposite
side that he's taking on this.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just business.

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And who knows
what he's actually

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:38.150 align:middle line:84%
thinking inside versus
what he feels must be said.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I guess we're not going
to know right away.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: I think
he truly believes

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.540 align:middle line:90%
the thin report they gave him.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I think he knows a lot
more than he lets on but--

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and he feels
strongly that that's

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:50.910 align:middle line:90%
the best for the country.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:51.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I think supreme
secrecy and all of this

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:56.540 align:middle line:90%
is a death knell for America.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: It may take 30, 40
years but it will be our ruin.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.300 align:middle line:84%
If we don't start getting
some real disclosure--

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: --some real
cooperation, and stop

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.900 align:middle line:84%
doing these dog
and pony shows that

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.610 align:middle line:90%
don't reveal hardly anything.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that means those
people, those shadowy people,

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:19.430 align:middle line:84%
the puppeteers so to speak,
really the agendas have

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:22.670 align:middle line:84%
to-- that can only happen if the
agenda stops and you let people

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:24.960 align:middle line:90%
advance as a civilization.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You allow their light
and their brilliance

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to start showing
itself and honoring it

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.730 align:middle line:90%
and quit suppressing it.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:33.770 align:middle line:84%
That means much
larger forces have

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.298 align:middle line:90%
to let go of the largest agenda.

00:46:36.298 --> 00:46:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Stopping the growth of
human consciousness.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:38.965 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Absolutely.

00:46:38.965 --> 00:46:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And the other problem
is a very asleep public.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:41.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It distracted--

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: My wife and I
have no family or friends

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.700 align:middle line:84%
that are on board with
what we're talking about.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.750 align:middle line:90%
They don't understand.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.430 align:middle line:90%
They don't care.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who told me
that ignorance is bliss.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, bliss
is only temporary.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:57.960 align:middle line:90%
So what good is your ignorance?

00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.343 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: It's the
kind of thing where

00:47:00.343 --> 00:47:02.310 align:middle line:90%
we have the perfect storm.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.210 align:middle line:84%
We have the mainstream media
behind the Military Industrial

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Complex and the
Black World, and we

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.600 align:middle line:90%
have a largely asleep public.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.770 align:middle line:90%
People say kids are woke.

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Young people are woke.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Woke to what?

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And people fomenting
racism, and inequality,

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and poverty, and
a poor environment

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that we could fix literally
overnight with technology.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Because all those
things are artificially

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.310 align:middle line:90%
stimulated and perpetuated.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:32.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:32.215 --> 00:47:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: I'm
always working with

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:35.190 align:middle line:90%
my African-American friends.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.650 align:middle line:90%
How do we solve these problems?

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
well, I don't know.

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, they don't
understand that these things

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:44.020 align:middle line:90%
are promulgated.

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: And if, oh,
California is waking up.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:52.667 align:middle line:84%
Let's-- some race riots
and/or a war or some--

00:47:52.667 --> 00:47:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
where it has to stop.

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Forest fires.

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:56.273 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do you see that?

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not talking
about those other forces.

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.520 align:middle line:84%
We really didn't spend
any time on that.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:90%
We will at another time.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you see a time where
they finally realize, hey,

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.080 align:middle line:90%
we've done all we can.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.490 align:middle line:90%
We have ours.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Go into hiding for
another 1,000 years

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:13.670 align:middle line:90%
or whatever they have to do.

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And just let people
continue on our journey

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.740 align:middle line:90%
to expand our consciousness.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you see them at a point
where they just give up?

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Let us go.

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: You mean as far
as the deep state and--

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:25.310 align:middle line:90%
The writ--

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: --the negative agenda.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the
deep state as it's

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.400 align:middle line:90%
been characterized recently.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.010 align:middle line:84%
The actual if you want
to call it deep state.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the shadowy forces
are that have enough power

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.310 align:middle line:84%
to run industry and run
a truly fascist agenda

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:38.420 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world--

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.712 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: With unlimited funds.

00:48:39.712 --> 00:48:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --with unlimited
funds, perpetuate wars,

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:84%
stimulate riots, anything they
need to do to keep us in fear

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.400 align:middle line:90%
and divided.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you see them
stopping at any point?

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: I'm sure they
have their defectors.

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But the hard core of them,
it's like you go back

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.180 align:middle line:90%
to World War II, the Nazis.

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.662 align:middle line:84%
No Nazi ever surrendered
from World War II.

00:48:58.662 --> 00:48:59.870 align:middle line:90%
They never signed a document.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:03.290 align:middle line:84%
They all went to Argentina, or
America, or Russia, or a few

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:04.640 align:middle line:90%
in Britain.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.380 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
change their ways.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.980 align:middle line:84%
A psychopath or
sociopath-psychopath,

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.250 align:middle line:90%
they're never going to change.

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.050 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they're
physically unable to.

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:17.870 align:middle line:84%
The people in the
gray areas, sure.

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:19.340 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get defectors.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.990 align:middle line:90%
But the people who are really--

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.367 align:middle line:84%
why do the Royal
Families of the world

00:49:24.367 --> 00:49:26.450 align:middle line:84%
never run out of money or
influence or power ever.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And one thing, this
is esoteric, but it

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.910 align:middle line:84%
is something that has been
occurring to me watching what's

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.650 align:middle line:84%
happening in Germany as well,
which they thought would never

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:35.450 align:middle line:90%
happen again.

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.822 align:middle line:84%
The whole story of
Franco X and all that.

00:49:37.822 --> 00:49:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking about,
and I thought, wait a minute.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.030 align:middle line:84%
If you want to look
at it through the lens

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:44.570 align:middle line:84%
of reincarnation, as we
just mentioned briefly,

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:47.090 align:middle line:84%
it's about time for
those guys to be back,

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.778 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily in your
DNA, but literally souls

00:49:50.778 --> 00:49:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that live from that
era are reincarnating--

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: True.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --sometimes with
the exact same psychopathy

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs and so
forth and now starting

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.220 align:middle line:84%
to express itself like it
looked pre World War II.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.020 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm just tossing it out.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's a matter
of how do you--

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:12.105 align:middle line:90%
no one can topple these guys.

00:50:12.105 --> 00:50:13.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
know who they are.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.855 align:middle line:84%
They don't have faces and they
have unlimited everything.

00:50:15.855 --> 00:50:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: I don't think
there's a way to do that.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: Earth is
a learning school--

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But we can wake up.

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Right.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The whole point
is it takes sleeping masses

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:23.770 align:middle line:90%
to agree to this.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.353 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: If you
wake up enough people

00:50:25.353 --> 00:50:27.850 align:middle line:84%
with a positive sense
of consciousness,

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:30.370 align:middle line:84%
the darkness will
go by the wayside.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: But that's never--
and people are trying to go up

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:34.270 align:middle line:90%
and trying to--

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.645 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not going to work.

00:50:34.645 --> 00:50:37.103 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: We're supposed to
learn from duality in the light

00:50:37.103 --> 00:50:37.987 align:middle line:90%
and dark.

00:50:37.987 --> 00:50:40.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way to
learn hard lessons in life.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WARNER: So we need,
you need the darkness

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:43.640 align:middle line:90%
like the yin and yang symbol.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.920 align:middle line:90%
You need the darkness.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.600 align:middle line:10%
There can't-- the
light cannot exist.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.600 align:middle line:10%
It's where I break
off from Steven Greer.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's-- the minority
of the universe is regressive

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.060 align:middle line:90%
and negative.

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.063 align:middle line:90%
5%, let's just say.

00:50:56.063 --> 00:50:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
need the contrast.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything needs the
contrast for growth.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:50:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: You need that.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: I need growth.

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, meanwhile,
you said, your book

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.250 align:middle line:84%
just finished up so it's
going to be out there shortly.

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:09.880 align:middle line:10%
So people can go to
littleanton.com, right?

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.190 align:middle line:10%
And pick up a copy, right?

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.990 align:middle line:10%
>>WARNER: Yep.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:14.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure
talking with you.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I would like to get together
with you again and have

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.160 align:middle line:90%
another conversation.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Absolutely.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.237 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, John.

00:51:20.237 --> 00:51:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WARNER: Thanks.

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, to enlighten
and entertain yourself

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:25.800 align:middle line:84%
with John's books,
he's already told you,

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.270 align:middle line:84%
this one is a bit
of a tough read.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.850 align:middle line:84%
You can find them
at littleanton.com

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.110 align:middle line:90%
and at major booksellers.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
