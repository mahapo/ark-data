>>REGINA MEREDITH:
As we continue

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:10%
to broaden our view
of ancient history,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:10%
we come to understand
that sacred principles,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:10%
and sites were not isolated
in their characteristics.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sites from
thousands of years ago

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and halfway around the
world from one another

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
had the same symbolism
and function,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
meaning there was a common or
cosmic language being used.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva is with us
today to tie together

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.395 align:middle line:84%
Andean temples and those of
Egypt, which this is a new one.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Absolutely.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:10%
But before we go
into the new one,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:10%
let's go into the newer one.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ooh.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and I were just
talking a few minutes ago

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:90%
off camera.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.536 align:middle line:90%
And you were saying--

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:84%
you were saying
what's so fascinating

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.740 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient information
that's emerging today

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:84%
is exactly these
things, the ties

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
between places that are so
disparate geographically

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:90%
and culturally.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And you said, oh, well let
me tell you about this.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.914 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a tease for
the next interview we do.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But let's just do it
while we're on the trail.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, such a tease.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
In my travels to
New Zealand, which

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
you don't get to hear much about
unless it's "Lord of the Rings"

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
stuff, there was a
culture there called

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:84%
the [INAUDIBLE],, who basically
precede the Maori by thousands

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And they just basically
published their oral history

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and traditions.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do the
Maori say about that?

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Are they OK?

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Do they acknowledge
they've been preceded?

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times
indigenous tribes

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.361 align:middle line:90%
don't like to acknowledge that.

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's a bit
of argy-bargy going on--

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I thought so.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --to do with
reparations, damages.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:84%
The British kind of said
that they would do--

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be the
indigenous people in order

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:90%
to receive those.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And here's the irony--

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's happening in this
country and all over the world.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's the irony
because the Maori actually

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
said that when they got to
New Zealand in about 1,000

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
AD that they actually displaced
another culture there.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.074 align:middle line:90%
So it's weirder and weirder.

00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
not just the Maori.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:90%
It's all indigenous species.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: All over the place.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Except
really Australia

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.180 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the one that
hearkens back the furthest,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.055 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:02:20.055 --> 00:02:20.855 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:84%
The Waitaha were describing
how an account of a time when

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
a big flood
overwhelmed the Earth,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that their culture basically
started off somewhere

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And contrary to popular
perception or even logic,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
they actually went
westwards through Europe.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
They ended up
across the Atlantic,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
ended up moving
into the Yucatan,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:84%
founded some temple
cities there.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Went down to Peru,
founded some things there,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:84%
then made their way across
to Easter Island, which

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
is not exactly an
easy place to find,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:90%
which is only 19 miles wide.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And then they
ended up in New Zealand,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:90%
up in Easter Island.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
That's where they bumped
into another bunch of sort

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
of godlike people that
had made a shorter journey

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
eastwards across Indonesia,
or what is today Indonesia.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Back then there was
a bigger land mass.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were master
navigators and star walkers.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And they had complete
understanding of the tides,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.164 align:middle line:84%
not just of the Earth
but of the heavens.

00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And they said that they
came from another time

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:90%
beyond time and space.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Also associated
with Orion, which

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
is a very Egyptian
concept as well.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So we don't give
these people enough credit

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.489 align:middle line:84%
that they got around much
more than we believe.

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, this is--

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what sparked that
conversation, as we're having--

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Suzanne, our lovely
makeup artist

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
was making and
fluffing our faces

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:90%
up with powder and everything.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
the fact that if you

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
take-- if you start really
expanding the viewpoint, which

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I think because of
shows like Deep Space

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that we have now and others,
and other cosmological

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:84%
perspectives, that the notion of
flight has been around forever.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
We're a relatively new
species in the universe.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Our technology has been
far greater in the past

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:84%
than it is now, and
look what we have now.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think if we just
consider that flight

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
of one kind or
another has always

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
been available to
the human species,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:84%
except for maybe little windows
of time in certain places,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.095 align:middle line:84%
then all of this starts
making a lot of sense.

00:04:15.095 --> 00:04:15.445 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're talking
about star species navigating

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
from Orion, from Sirius,
and so forth, then we

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
can see how you can actually
take a species of people

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.667 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, pick them up and
relocate them as well, right?

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:84%
If we actually look at the
very, very ancient texts

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
of for example the Tamil
culture of southern India,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
they go back 100,000,
200,000 years.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.767 align:middle line:84%
And these people just
didn't have an imagination.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
They actually were writing
about actual physical events.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.230 align:middle line:84%
This stuff is so
well documented,

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard to actually
make this stuff up.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.215 align:middle line:84%
And they do describe
the vimana craft.

00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:53.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:55.056 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They do describe
flight through the air.

00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:59.930 align:middle line:84%
We've found models of Egyptian
planes in Egyptian tombs.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And so of course this
stuff was pretty much--

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, they were just
describing what they saw back

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:84%
in the era before a big
flood wiped the slate clean

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and then we had to go
and start doing things

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.849 align:middle line:90%
like getting around by boat.

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's where a lot of
the cultures come from.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Always across
the ocean by boat.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
we're stuck archaeologically

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and historically,
unfortunately, so it

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:90%
keeps slowing the story down.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
We can't-- in the
world of academia.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the world
of mainstream media,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
the story's slowed down,
because they can't acknowledge

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
these things, even though
it's not even hiding

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:90%
in-- it's not even hiding.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
It's in plain sight, like the
helicopter glyph, for example,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.025 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt and many, many others.

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:84%
People use that a lot,
because it's an easy target.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, it does
explain this kind of movement.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So then the question becomes,
who, and why, and when?

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So that leads us into the story
we're going to now, right?

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.395 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.376 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean, so
many of the cultures

00:05:56.376 --> 00:06:00.240 align:middle line:84%
have so many overlaps of
construction, myth, symbology.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And when they're 180 degrees
opposite each other on the face

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, you've
got to wonder, A,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.520 align:middle line:84%
did they just
hallucinate this stuff?

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:84%
2, did they take
on some narcotic

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
where they tapped into an
astral reference library?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.645 align:middle line:84%
Or did they get around much more
than we give them credit for?

00:06:16.645 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And we start looking
at the linguistics

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:90%
and the etymology of things.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I mean, there
are Egyptian phrases

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:84%
that appear in Central American,
South American, Easter Island,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:84%
not exactly an
easy place to find

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the Pacific.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And you also find these things
now in the original culture

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:90%
of New Zealand.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.867 align:middle line:84%
So they obviously got
around much, much more.

00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Obviously.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And Easter Island is said to
be the remnant of the Lemurian

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the last remnants.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They mentioned
that back then the island

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:90%
was much bigger.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They had to actually go
around a certain landmass that

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:90%
no longer exists.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And they actually talk
about this, the Waitaha.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
They claim that a
lot of these people

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that were master
astronomers and sailors,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
they were finding islands all
over the place in the Pacific.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And they said that most
of these no longer exist.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So that's
a time when the sea

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:90%
level rose dramatically.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And that puts us in a timeframe
of about 9000 BC, which

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.510 align:middle line:84%
is about the time when we
get hit by the disintegrating

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:90%
fragments of a very large comet.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And what you brought
up a moment ago

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.400 align:middle line:84%
is interesting, because I
think in some cases too much is

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:90%
being laid on it.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is the notion of doing
induced states of consciousness

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.790 align:middle line:84%
via sacred roots and drugs and
so forth, ayahuasca and others.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that story
maybe has co-opted

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
some of these other truths,
that these people were

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.932 align:middle line:84%
hallucinating and able
to travel mentally.

00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:90%
What about the obvious?

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.107 align:middle line:90%
They just traveled, you know?

00:07:44.107 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They actually traveled.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
actually traveled.

00:07:46.405 --> 00:07:47.205 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
actually left deposits.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:90%
They left artifacts.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
They left messages
for the future,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:84%
in fact, within those artifacts
for future civilizations,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:84%
because some of them also
were tapped in psychically

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.165 align:middle line:84%
to the point where they did
know the deluge was coming,

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.086 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there
were things that were

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:90%
preserved for future times.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, in
the various catastrophes

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis and so forth,
they had advance knowledge

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:90%
when these were going to happen.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So people were taken off
and put around the globe

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:90%
with knowledge.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And to me, if we just start from
that place, then all of this

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
becomes really not only
interesting, but logical.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look at so
many of the sacred sites,

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:84%
the really ancient sites where
they use ridiculously sized

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.886 align:middle line:84%
rocks just to measure the
movement of the seasons,

00:08:33.886 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
you and I can just go in our
backyard and take small tree

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.684 align:middle line:84%
trunks and do that much easier
than holding a 1,000-ton piece

00:08:39.684 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
of rock and putting
it here, and there,

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and make a circle out of it and
then figure out the procession

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.350 align:middle line:90%
of the equinoxes.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.825 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're obviously
tracking something

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:49.394 align:middle line:90%
along a long distance of time.

00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And why would it
matter to them, anyway?

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they would have
been long dead anyway

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.870 align:middle line:90%
within the first generation.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.071 align:middle line:90%
Why would it matter?

00:08:55.071 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
The only reason
that makes any sense

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:84%
is the fact they were
attracting deep space objects.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.908 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They knew
that time is cyclical.

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:84%
They knew that the Earth crosses
certain belts and pathways

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:84%
of objects flying through
all the time, which

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.485 align:middle line:84%
is why NASA nowadays takes
a very important interest

00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:11.285 align:middle line:90%
in asteroids--

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.135 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --and the detection
of deep space objects.

00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:90%
They know about these stories.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.924 align:middle line:84%
And they went to figure out that
people were going to survive.

00:09:19.924 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Some people would die.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Some would survive.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So they built these places
to last for another culture

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:90%
to pick that up.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because it was
important for humanity

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:84%
to know its place in the
universe and to know itself.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.735 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And once
you know that, you've

00:09:31.735 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:90%
got some degree of control.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And you also come under the
idea that, yes, not all of us

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:90%
are here to be here forever.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:84%
That's part of what
being human is all about.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I think we've become
attached to this concept

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
that somehow we have to
go through life from birth

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and survive the full 86 and 1/2
years that we have to by law

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
to be here, not a
day sooner than that.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, that's
not how it works.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
We all have our given time
and place and everything.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.956 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they
understood this.

00:09:57.956 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
They understood that
we have a bigger part

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:90%
to play in the bigger picture.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And the more ancient, the
more refined the knowledge.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have de-evolved on
a scale of consciousness more

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
or less to what we
are now, which is--

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.630 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to
pop back up a bit.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But just
a bit, really.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.830 align:middle line:90%
And, you know--

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And building
periods as well.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you look at--

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: One of the things
I do with people on tours

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
is that I say, well, group,
how old is this site?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's got to be about
2,000 years, 3,000 years old.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you
look at the stone.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.440 align:middle line:84%
The bigger the stone and the
more well-fitting and the less

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
mortar, the older it is.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the-- and
Peru's a good example,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
because you look at the
original sites down there,

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:84%
they have massive megaliths,
beautifully fitted,

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:90%
no mortar whatsoever.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Then something happens.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
There's like a 1,000- 2,000-year
period where another society

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:84%
comes along, builds things
on top, even more refined,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
smaller stones, but still
big nevertheless, no mortar,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
almost chiseled into
place by a lathe.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:90%
And then something happens.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Another person comes
along and you get smaller,

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:90%
the stones get smaller.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.560 align:middle line:90%
There's more mortar.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:90%
There's more ill-fitting.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Then the odd earthquake
appears and the recent stuff

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:90%
gets destroyed.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the
old stuff stays.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good point.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.095 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's my way of
figuring out how old is it.

00:11:10.095 --> 00:11:12.094 align:middle line:84%
If it's really big
and it's machined,

00:11:12.094 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be
really, really old.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.852 align:middle line:84%
And machined, again,
same thing as flying.

00:11:16.852 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
There have always been device
to be able to cut stone

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the same
thing goes culturally,

00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people get
hung up over the notion,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:84%
for example, that
the Mayan culture--

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.680 align:middle line:84%
thinking, oh, no, it was
such a bloody culture.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:84%
What these people did
and the sacrifices

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.701 align:middle line:84%
of children and virgins at
these pyramids and such.

00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, that wasn't-- those aren't
the people that constructed

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:90%
those edifices.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.249 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are
late-comers that had devolved

00:11:42.249 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:90%
in their consciousness by then.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it
wasn't even the Maya.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:90%
It was the Aztecs.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: People confuse the two.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.701 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You get to
Maya lands, or Yucatan,

00:11:48.701 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:84%
which is a very different
feel to the rest of Mexico,

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.990 align:middle line:84%
you talk to the
local wisdom-keepers,

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and none of this stuff ever
gets its way into English.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:90%
It's always kept in here.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.236 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they'll
say the same thing.

00:11:59.236 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they lost
the plot up north,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.810 align:middle line:84%
because they took these
spiritual concepts

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:84%
about the decapitation
of the body

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.022 align:middle line:84%
and the flaying of the self,
but those are spiritual ideals.

00:12:10.022 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:84%
It's about removing your
physical self in order

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
to cross into another
level of reality.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.875 align:middle line:90%
It's the path of the initiate.

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And they took this literally,
because they lost the plot.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.791 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
were killing people

00:12:19.791 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:90%
in order to appease the gods.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:84%
In the Maya culture, which
goes back much way further

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.865 align:middle line:84%
back than we think, in fact,
the earliest surviving culture

00:12:27.865 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
of the Maya is called
the Itz culture, I-T-Z.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones that came
from a sinking continent called

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Atitlan.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:84%
They moved to the Yucatan,
founded the Temple [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I was just there at the
center of the Itz culture.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's in a place called
Lake Atitlan land in Guatemala.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.233 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's still there.

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:49.246 align:middle line:84%
They still have their
sacred mound and the--

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:84%
they basically
wanted to recreate

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.605 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis in their image
and their own time.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.105 align:middle line:84%
They found a big lake where
they could kind of feel at home.

00:12:55.105 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So it's all there.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and we
talked about some of this,

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:84%
again the rites and
practices and knowledge,

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.160 align:middle line:84%
not just the edifices, but the
practices and knowledge that

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
devolved through time to what
we see today by way of secret

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
handshakes and, you
know, painful rituals,

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.150 align:middle line:84%
which really had no bearing
on what was initially-- yes--

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.660 align:middle line:84%
on what was initially
practiced in the higher times.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reminded of one-- it
just passed through my head

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:28.950 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the royal
children having dangles--

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.570 align:middle line:84%
having items dangled
in front of them

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
when they were very little to
cross the eyes of the royalty,

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
That became a later
concept, right?

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In-- was that among
the Aztecs or the Mayans?

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.132 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was
among the Aztecs.

00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've think it filtered
through to the Olmec

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:90%
and the Maya in a certain way.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
To cross the eyes
of the children.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And one day, it was
occurring to me--

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I was crossing my eyes,
right, in meditation.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, well, but look.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:84%
That creates an
interesting synaptic jump

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
between the hemispheres
of the brain

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and opens it up
for communication.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So at one time, they
communicated freely.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.465 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, this is
being forced and perpetuated

00:14:04.465 --> 00:14:07.240 align:middle line:84%
in an artificial way
that may never meet that.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And by the time a few hundred
years or 1,000 years passes,

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
no one knows why the baby's
eyes are crossed anymore.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is typical.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.215 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's like the
elongated skull story.

00:14:15.215 --> 00:14:16.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:16.015 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If you go
to Peru, there's

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:90%
different types of skulls.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.419 align:middle line:90%
There are ones which--

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:90%
well, they look like coneheads.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.807 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they do.

00:14:23.807 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Someone just literally
just wrapped the head up

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.417 align:middle line:84%
with boards and it looks really
bizarre and actually funny.

00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But there are the other ones
that look actually unusual,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
but they have an
elegance about them.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, those are the real
what they call the gods.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day, a god was
essentially a force of nature.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But they were
physical people that

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:90%
epitomized the force of nature.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.153 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
think you're talking

00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:44.485 align:middle line:90%
about Akhenaten, Nefertiti.

00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And their
offspring, for example.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That came from
that particular lineage.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.416 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And these were
people that basically,

00:14:49.416 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:84%
that the fathers and the
mothers wanted the children

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:84%
to grow up to look
like the gods,

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:54.553 align:middle line:90%
to resemble like the gods.

00:14:54.553 --> 00:14:57.437 align:middle line:84%
But nobody knew what was going
on back in the historical era,

00:14:57.437 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:84%
because this information
goes back to pre-history.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's part
of an old culture

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:90%
that survived the flood.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's written in
the Egyptian texts

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
about the very tall followers of
Horus that survived the flood.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And they had the
knowledge of the gods.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
rebuild, and I quote,

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
"the former mansions
of the gods,"

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
because these fell
under the waves.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
places that became

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.939 align:middle line:84%
the foundations of the
temples that we see today.

00:15:20.939 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's a story that
happens around the world.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you do find
some of the examples

00:15:24.855 --> 00:15:26.441 align:middle line:90%
of the natural elongated skulls.

00:15:26.441 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Tell us where in the world
they've found these so far.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.546 align:middle line:84%
It's not just in
18th dynasty Egypt.

00:15:31.546 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Where else?

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.534 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Peru, in a
place called Scythia,

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
which is around
the Black Sea, one

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
of the oldest cultures on Earth
that nobody knows much about.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:84%
They eventually
migrated to the Sumeria.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:84%
They created the
Sumerian culture.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The main caste of the
Scythians were the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:84%
the followers of the goddess
Ana, the mother of the gods.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually morphed all
the way north through Norway

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.554 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the
Scottish islands,

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
where we have giant's graves
there to this very day.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.588 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So that's
the story there.

00:15:59.588 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, of course, there
were the same people,

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:84%
called the followers of
Horus or the Akhu Shemsu Hor.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And that they eventually--
when they built the foundations

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:84%
for the temples
we see today, they

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
said that then we traveled
to the hinterlands,

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to the northern lands,
to build temples there.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And we find the original site
for Stonehenge at 8000 BC.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's carbon-dated now.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Not that many people
actually admit that.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.227 align:middle line:84%
But it's carbon-dated
to 8000 BC.

00:16:25.227 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's the right
time period when people

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:90%
would have moved from Egypt.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have that story there
through the Druidic culture

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.987 align:middle line:84%
that say, yes, we had
elongated-- had people here.

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:90%
They were very tall.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we call
these mounds in which they

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:90%
buried in giant's graves.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I used to live right next
door to a couple of them.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I--

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In England?

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I used to have
a sandwich and cup of tea

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:90%
every other day.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talking
with the elders.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
That's where most of my
information comes from.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Didn't you know?

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I know
some of it does, actually.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:90%
So on that--

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, on that, let's start
migrating into the Peruvian

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
story, and then the gods
that connect the two--

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
what are called
gods, because we--

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that's a really loose
term, honestly, the gods.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
talking about forces.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:90%
You're talking about energies.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.540 align:middle line:90%
You're talking about cosmology.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It's really such
a complex picture

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
of what is distilled
down to the gods.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take it from
your perspective of Osiris

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:90%
and Isis.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.993 align:middle line:84%
And later, we're going to
get into their offspring,

00:17:25.993 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
because it seems that these
same entities, forces, gods

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:84%
are showing up in Peru, in
the artifacts in Peru as they

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:90%
did in Egypt.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:90%
It was the strangest thing.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Not much is known about
the places in Peru,

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:84%
because so little
was written down.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And what little was written
down was basically eviscerated

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:90%
by the conquistadors.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.086 align:middle line:84%
But when I went on
my trips there--

00:17:49.086 --> 00:17:50.585 align:middle line:84%
and it's the funny
thing about Peru,

00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:52.084 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's the
high altitude that

00:17:52.084 --> 00:17:54.294 align:middle line:84%
allows you to see and
hear much more clearly,

00:17:54.294 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:90%
because the sites are alive.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.376 align:middle line:90%
They're living beings.

00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
They talk back to you if
you have the right intent.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about something
and I'm hearing information

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:90%
coming in on this side.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.323 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, I hope I can
remember this stuff.

00:18:04.323 --> 00:18:05.744 align:middle line:90%
This is really good material.

00:18:05.744 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly
realized, you know,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.659 align:middle line:84%
if I was an ancient Egyptian
traveling through Peru,

00:18:09.659 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and knowing what I know
about ancient Egypt

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and their initiation practices,
I applied the same methodology

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:84%
to the temples, and it
all fit in perfectly.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And one of the places
that I really admire

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
is Saksaywaman,
which actually means

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
"the place of the
satisfied falcon."

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.258 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I'm
thinking, wait a minute.

00:18:27.258 --> 00:18:30.440 align:middle line:84%
The falcon does not feature
in Andean mythology.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, the condor does,
but not the falcon.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If I was an
Egyptian, the falcon--

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
the phrase "the
falcon is satisfied"

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:84%
relates to Horus, who is the
reborn image of the risen god

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Osiris.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, my god.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Could it be true that
the principles of Osiris,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and Horus, and Isis
were brought here?

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of that thing
was to do with initiation.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, initiation means
to become conscious.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And the story of
Osiris and Isis really

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.090 align:middle line:84%
is about the initiate who
travels out of body while alive

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and crosses into
the other world.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And his idea is to meet
up with his divine bride

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:90%
or the divine virgin.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We know the story in the
medieval era as the holy grail,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:90%
not a physical object at all.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that-- and this
is how the ancients thought--

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:84%
that all the wisdom
in the universe

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:84%
resides in a hollow space
in the darkness of space,

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:90%
before even God was created.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Primal.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Everything that
was known about everything

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.025 align:middle line:84%
resides in the darkness
before light was created.

00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The hidden
logos and prima materia.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.744 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That creates all.

00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they embodied this
into a creative personality

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
which they said, well, it has
to be a woman, because it's

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:90%
a creative personality.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, all
wisdom is embodied

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.697 align:middle line:84%
in a divine virgin,
which is a concept that

00:19:49.697 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:90%
survives to this very day.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Using the material
properties of reality.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So the idea was, first
of all on a metaphorical level,

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.803 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
take the invisible

00:19:57.803 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and try to physicalize this
so you can understand it

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:84%
as a mental construct, is
to say Osiris represents

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:84%
the initiate who crosses
into the other side,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle line:84%
comes into contact with the
world of the gods, which

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:84%
is the forces of
nature and the cosmos.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
He understands the
information and knowledge.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why he marries this
divine bride called Isis.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.810 align:middle line:84%
There's the chemical
marriage of the masculine

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and the feminine, the
physical and the invisible.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And then he returns into his
body, risen as a palm tree,

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
which is why Jesus
took on the symbol

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:84%
of the resurrected god-man as
the palm tree, as a symbol.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:90%
But that's another story.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And then he basically resurrects
in his symbol as Horus,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:90%
as the resurrected falcon.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why the falcon is very
happy and very satisfied.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Horus is
directly linked with the sun,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.400 align:middle line:90%
the realm of the sun.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if
you look at it more

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:84%
cosmologically,
then how would you

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
take that outward
into cosmology,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Isis, Osiris, the
sun, the sun that

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:90%
gives life and birth to itself.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:84%
The marriage of the
sun and the moon.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:84%
The sun would be
the solar principle.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.502 align:middle line:90%
This is not gender-based.

00:21:02.502 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is about--

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, any guy can
do a feminine role

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and anybody can do the
vice-- it's not a gender.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But this masculine and
feminine principles.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The principles are.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Kind of like
an electricity socket,

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
you have your positive and
your negative polarity.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So the sun is usually masculine,
because it's very powerful

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.690 align:middle line:90%
and it bursts things out.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.010 align:middle line:90%
The moon is more receptive.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the reflection of
the sun, so it's feminine.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the marriage
of the sun and the moon.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.156 align:middle line:84%
And in order to be that
in your physical self,

00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
there were people
that would take

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle line:84%
on the properties of Osiris, and
they would try to imitate that

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.259 align:middle line:84%
by undergoing a ritual
where they actually

00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:84%
did leave the body, came back
into their physical self.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.904 align:middle line:84%
They came back having
married a divine bride.

00:21:40.904 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:90%
And then that would become--

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.861 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would they
go into the sun realm,

00:21:43.861 --> 00:21:45.111 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, in these rituals?

00:21:45.111 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:84%
They would become the reborn
sun, much brighter than before.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was
symbolized, ironically,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.670 align:middle line:84%
by the rising of Venus before
the sunrise at the equinox,

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.227 align:middle line:84%
because the equinox
basically is the balance.

00:21:57.227 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Most people seem to
associate the fact

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:84%
that when you become
very knowledgeable,

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:01.520 align:middle line:90%
you are the light.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
But you also have to
understand the dark.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
The symbol of the
risen initiate,

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.555 align:middle line:84%
the resurrected person,
has to be the balance.

00:22:08.555 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
You have to know the
balance between the two.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why the spring
equinox was always

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:90%
the time of initiation.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So the initiate
would be taken out

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.094 align:middle line:84%
of his sarcophagus, or
his cave, or his pyramid.

00:22:19.094 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:90%
He would stand on the mound.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And he would look at Venus as
the morning star, the brightest

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.180 align:middle line:90%
object before the reborn sun.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think in biblical code, so
to speak, we need to start at--

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:84%
people that are maybe not
scholars per se of the Bible,

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:84%
but study the Bible,
it's good just

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.500 align:middle line:84%
to start substituting one
thing, start looking at the word

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:84%
"sun," S-U-N and
S-O-N, and look at them

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:84%
almost in interchangeable
ways in certain areas.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a lot
of interesting and beautiful

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:84%
information that
is embedded there.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, it's all metaphors.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all metaphors.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Once you start taking
this and intellectualizing it,

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.862 align:middle line:90%
you get totally lost.

00:22:54.862 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
This is why we end up
with skewed religion.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:84%
They take things literally
that should be metaphoric.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.965 align:middle line:84%
So the sun and a son
are essentially--

00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
you have to be a mirror
of the cosmic forces,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.540 align:middle line:84%
because back in the day, they
recognized that everything

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, it's perfect.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But you come under the influence
of material forces, which

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:90%
are degenerative by nature.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.079 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we are born.

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
From that moment, we're
really degenerating

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:90%
towards death, oddly enough.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.775 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.775 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:90%
And so it's an imperfect world.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And in order to become a
perfect being in this lifetime,

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:84%
or at least try to
portray that, you

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.570 align:middle line:84%
have to be a mirror
image of the perfection

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
of the heavens, which cycle
it around in perfection.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.590 align:middle line:84%
They're accountable to
mathematics and geometry.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Therefore, to take
that perfect heavenly abode,

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and replace it on Earth
and play it out on Earth

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
was the ultimate aim of
the initiates, so the sun

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and the son become
mirrors of each other.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The marriage of spirit
and matter, mater, mother.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we are,
the marriage of the two

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:90%
inside each of us.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
learning to contend

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
with that on any kind of
level of mastery really

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.422 align:middle line:84%
is what this journey
is all about.

00:24:00.422 --> 00:24:01.504 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Well, exactly.

00:24:01.504 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very,
very old journey.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:90%
It goes back thousands of years.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I found the initiation
concepts of the initiate

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
crossing to the other
world, coming back, marrying

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:84%
his divine bride, and
carrying on his daily duties

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:84%
going back to 6000 BC,
the cult of Mithra,

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
which then becomes the
cult of Jesus, same guy.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.316 align:middle line:84%
They just took out
Mithra, put in Jesus.

00:24:20.316 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:84%
If you look at those
same birth dates

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, they're the
same with, oh gosh, probably

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:84%
a dozen of the
historical figures

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.070 align:middle line:84%
we know as religious
or spiritual leaders.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the same story.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.349 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were just
replaying the concept

00:24:36.349 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:90%
or the metaphor as real people.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're call god-men.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it actually
answers a lot

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.390 align:middle line:84%
of problems that don't make any
sense in places like the Bible,

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.145 align:middle line:90%
where Jesus is the son of God.

00:24:45.145 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Gnostics were
saying, well, no, we're

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.322 align:middle line:90%
all sons of God.

00:24:48.322 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And even the women
are sons of God.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.770 align:middle line:90%
There was no gender thing.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.571 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:51.571 --> 00:24:53.611 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because it actually
reveals your highest

00:24:53.611 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:90%
level of initiation.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You join as a
neophyte as a son of a woman.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.950 align:middle line:84%
That's when you enter
the mystery secrets.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And you graduate, and you
graduate as a son of a man.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.720 align:middle line:84%
If you care to keep going
for another few years

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and learn more weird stuff, then
you become a son of the gods.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you go for the
final initiation of being

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
in the cave or the
sarcophagus and then

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
rising from the
dead metaphorically,

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.187 align:middle line:90%
you become son of God.

00:25:17.187 --> 00:25:19.645 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually revealing his
highest level of initiation.

00:25:19.645 --> 00:25:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.496 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So Jesus, Osiris--

00:25:22.496 --> 00:25:23.296 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mithras.

00:25:23.296 --> 00:25:25.296 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Zoroaster, Mithra,
all of these people,

00:25:25.296 --> 00:25:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Shiva, it's all the same person.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.253 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because
they're fundamentally

00:25:29.253 --> 00:25:30.094 align:middle line:90%
following concepts.

00:25:30.094 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:84%
This is where we begin to
intellectualize it and get

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:90%
it wrong and very confused.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:35.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
into the various sites.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.076 align:middle line:84%
And we have some beautiful
photos that you've taken,

00:25:39.076 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:90%
because you do that as well.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
really lovely.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I was so happy to
see these photos.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Well, thank you.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go
to the very first one.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:90%
You say it.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.984 align:middle line:84%
You say "sexy woman," but that's
not the real pronunciation.

00:25:52.984 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You know,
at high altitude,

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very hard to
speak any kind of language.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you
sort of go [MUMBLES]..

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can't pronounce it.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:00.775 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, the local guides
say, if it's difficult for you,

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.960 align:middle line:90%
say "sexy woman."

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.304 align:middle line:90%
It's actually Saksaywaman.

00:26:05.304 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Saksaywaman.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.598 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This is why you
chew the coca leaf every day

00:26:09.598 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:84%
up there, is to keep the
oxygen flowing apparently.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Saksaywaman
was a huge revelation.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it features the
most incredible megalithic

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.067 align:middle line:84%
structures anyone's ever seen,
beautiful interlocking stones.

00:26:21.067 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
suddenly begun to realize

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:90%
the connection with Egypt.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.710 align:middle line:84%
They came from the understanding
of the name, "the place

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:90%
of the satisfied falcon."

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, if
this is a ritual complex,

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:84%
there have to be certain
solar alignments that

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:90%
would make sense.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you go to
the top of Saksaywaman

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:40.294 align:middle line:84%
and there's a big sort
of circle on the summit.

00:26:40.294 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:10%
And if you actually care
to do the alignments,

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.470 align:middle line:10%
the backbone of the
entire site actually

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.744 align:middle line:10%
does look at Venus
rising on the equinox.

00:26:47.744 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only place
you can see it from,

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:84%
on that particular
brow of that hill.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually take
the entire site from the air,

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.520 align:middle line:84%
which you can do now thanks to
Google Earth, back in the day,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.220 align:middle line:84%
before the Spaniards
destroyed half of it,

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.080 align:middle line:84%
the walls on one
side, which looked

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:84%
like a complete jagged zigzag,
when you see it from the air,

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.399 align:middle line:84%
they actually look
like a wings of a bird

00:27:07.399 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:84%
when you complete the other side
and you put the other side--

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:90%
and rebuild the other side.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: And when you
actually take the alignment,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:10%
you actually do find that the
walls of the original temple

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.410 align:middle line:10%
do set the winter solstice
and the summer solstice.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
initiation positions

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to do with this cult of
Osiris, and the cult of Horus.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So it made a lot of sense,
just from that point.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because the
association with the wings

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:90%
was Horus.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:27:31.005 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's why the place
is "the place of the satisfied

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:33.525 align:middle line:90%
falcon."

00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You are
growing your wings,

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:84%
so you have metaphor upon
symbolism taking place.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.370 align:middle line:84%
It is a place where
you can lift yourself,

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.681 align:middle line:90%
you can fly into the heavens.

00:27:40.681 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think
that just from what

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:84%
you were able to see even
intuitively there and some

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.300 align:middle line:84%
of the people that were
with you on your tour,

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:84%
was it similar
types of practices?

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Or does each region
that embodies

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:84%
this energy, these
edifices and so forth,

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:00.129 align:middle line:84%
do they have each their
own brand of initiation?

00:28:00.129 --> 00:28:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was
pretty much the same.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was it?

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's what's
amazing about this.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to what we
were saying earlier about

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.210 align:middle line:84%
how this stuff got
around much more

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.575 align:middle line:90%
than we give it credit for.

00:28:08.575 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
surprised me, whether I

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:84%
was in Peru, or Central
America, or in the Pacific,

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:84%
or in Ireland, or Scotland,
or central Europe, Egypt.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much it
was the same idea.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.440 align:middle line:84%
The idea was that
you took a path

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
where you try to
mimic the soul's

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:90%
journey in the other world.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And you came back
into your body.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:84%
No one actually died or
got nailed to a cross.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:90%
These are just metaphors.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Even the gnostic
Christians describe

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.700 align:middle line:90%
this in their banned gospels.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.350 align:middle line:90%
That's why they were banned.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And in fact,
there's a big plaza,

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:84%
a big oval on the
side of Saksaywaman,

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.282 align:middle line:84%
which few people actually
give it much notice.

00:28:42.282 --> 00:28:43.865 align:middle line:84%
And that there's a
little sort of room

00:28:43.865 --> 00:28:47.350 align:middle line:84%
or what's left of it on the
west side, which perfectly

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.990 align:middle line:90%
matches these equinox sunsets.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're an initiate
and you know the language,

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.161 align:middle line:84%
you actually start
in the sunset,

00:28:54.161 --> 00:28:56.410 align:middle line:84%
because you're following the
path of the ascending sun

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:90%
into the other world.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And there is a
tunnel there in Saksaywaman,

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.402 align:middle line:84%
where you go through
the actual earth.

00:29:03.402 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is destroyed
because the Spaniards, we know,

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:90%
did blow a lot of this up.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But enough of the
actual system remains

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
where you come
through these tunnels

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and you exit exactly to
face the equinox sunrise.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.900 align:middle line:90%
That's an initiation position.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that you'd
go into the underworld

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:84%
to actually mirror the actual
way the soul is completely

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:84%
discombobulated, doesn't know
its way around that dark.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you come
back out of it safely,

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.176 align:middle line:84%
you come back to
the light, which

00:29:31.176 --> 00:29:33.466 align:middle line:84%
is what the whole point of
learning about the mysteries

00:29:33.466 --> 00:29:34.310 align:middle line:90%
is all about.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's just that one
part of Saksaywaman.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.750 align:middle line:84%
There's all of
these symbols still

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.330 align:middle line:84%
there that pretty much
reveal one of the reasons

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.254 align:middle line:90%
why it was there.

00:29:41.254 --> 00:29:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's also, of course,
the sacred mount, which

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.647 align:middle line:90%
no one pays any attention to.

00:29:45.647 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:84%
They all want to go to
the top of the mount.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.271 align:middle line:84%
They want to go and
look at the big stones.

00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:51.400 align:middle line:84%
But while you're
actually standing on it

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and looking back
upon it, it becomes

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.865 align:middle line:84%
obvious when you see the
symbolism in the layers, which

00:29:57.865 --> 00:30:00.790 align:middle line:84%
are still built. And
this central mound

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.130 align:middle line:84%
is based on nine
layers of information,

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:84%
nine layers of
stones, which again

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:84%
from the symbology
point of view,

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.100 align:middle line:84%
it's about the nine
levels of perfection

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.260 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
achieve as an initiate.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So each level of this
man-made pyramid,

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:84%
which is literally built
around the natural mound,

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.930 align:middle line:84%
is telling you that you have
to rise upon each level of nine

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:84%
to get higher and closer
to the realm of the gods.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.426 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
primordial mound in Egypt.

00:30:25.426 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:84%
All the temples
are built on what

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.440 align:middle line:84%
they call primordial mounds that
were the first lumps of rock

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.080 align:middle line:90%
to escape the flood.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the bird,
the Bennu bird perches.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's where knowledge
becomes inherent in that mound.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.022 align:middle line:84%
And again, as an
Egyptian at Saksaywaman,

00:30:41.022 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought,
that's exactly what

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
we have at Heliopolis
in Egypt as well.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:90%
It's the same story.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, part of that mound
at Saksaywaman has bare rock.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And it actually looks like water
cascading down the actual hill.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So the site was specifically
chosen for the composition

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.099 align:middle line:90%
of the stone as well.

00:30:57.099 --> 00:30:58.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And always
sunrise and sunset.

00:30:58.765 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be in all of
them, which is metaphorical also

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.010 align:middle line:90%
for the journey of the soul.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.850 align:middle line:84%
We often think,
oh, sunrise, birth.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:05.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Often it meant
exactly the opposite.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Sunrise was the release
from the physical realm

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:90%
back to the other realms.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And then going back
into the darkness

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.885 align:middle line:84%
was reincarnation,
incarnating once again.

00:31:17.885 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it was
always the balance.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:19.928 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:19.928 --> 00:31:21.511 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You have
to know the balance.

00:31:21.511 --> 00:31:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go into the
dark of forgetting again

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:84%
into a new life to have to
remember and start again

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.600 align:middle line:84%
is the cycle of the darkness
in many of these traditions.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.930 align:middle line:10%
No amount of learning
about the light

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.250 align:middle line:10%
will compensate for
the fact that you have

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:10%
to understand the dark as well.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.180 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: You have a barometer.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.480 align:middle line:10%
We keep going back to
the story of "Star Wars"

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.360 align:middle line:10%
and how it so
epitomizes this concept,

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.210 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of people
say, yes, Han Solo

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.040 align:middle line:10%
and Luke Skywalker, yeah.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But the real story
is about Anakin.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:84%
He is a guy who's
learned to be a Jedi.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:90%
He's gone into the light.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.510 align:middle line:84%
But then he gets
seduced by the dark.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.950 align:middle line:84%
But at the very end, he
understands the mistake

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:90%
he's made.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.100 align:middle line:90%
That's the path of the initiate.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:84%
He's come to understand both
and he's now harmonized himself.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there it is
right in front of you

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:84%
in popular culture,
the actual sort

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.330 align:middle line:84%
of path of the
initiate who learns

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.250 align:middle line:84%
to blend both within
himself and understands

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:90%
that, OK, I understand both.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:15.970 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to not ride
the knife edge, which

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.130 align:middle line:84%
is why the equinox,
spring equinox is so

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.380 align:middle line:90%
important to these mysteries.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is the beauty of
the human, the human journey.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
texts that say,

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.960 align:middle line:84%
a human being that has gone
through these rites of passage

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:84%
who has developed themselves,
and created refinement,

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and discipline,
and understanding,

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and a loving heart, and
so on, is greater than all

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.510 align:middle line:84%
of the angels flapping their
wings above who do not have

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:90%
such challenges to rise to.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:90%
And I happen to agree with that.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I think the human being
is an amazing species.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And these sites are dedicated to
the upliftment of human beings.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.614 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Absolutely,
without exception.

00:32:52.614 --> 00:32:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, a lot
of the stuff that you

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:84%
hear from renowned psychics,
people who actually work

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.830 align:middle line:84%
with the police
to resolve crimes,

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.900 align:middle line:84%
they'll say through
their connections

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.970 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the
teachings talk about how

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.860 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people in
this kind of world

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:84%
who've had so many incarnations,
they are envious of anyone who

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.690 align:middle line:90%
has the courage and tenacity--

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:90%
To come here.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --to go
into a physical body.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because
you're so limited.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.768 align:middle line:90%
And they know the challenges.

00:33:14.768 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well,
please ask us for help.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.676 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're here.

00:33:17.676 --> 00:33:18.507 align:middle line:90%
We're bored.

00:33:18.507 --> 00:33:19.307 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:19.307 --> 00:33:21.348 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We actually want
to help you, so listen.

00:33:21.348 --> 00:33:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Ask us for help and
then learn to hear.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Get out of your
thinking mode, and just

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:84%
be at the sacred space, or
make your own sacred space

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.240 align:middle line:84%
your own temple the
place where you can be.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.990 align:middle line:84%
This is why meditation
is so important.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.455 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You don't actually
need to go to the temple,

00:33:34.455 --> 00:33:35.577 align:middle line:90%
although it's fun.

00:33:35.577 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:90%
You can be with your own temple.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.320 align:middle line:90%
You know, even Jesus said that.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.365 align:middle line:84%
The temple of God resides within
you, so learn to still that,

00:33:41.365 --> 00:33:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
important information.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So these places were built
so that we would remember

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.812 align:middle line:90%
when we forget the plot.

00:33:47.812 --> 00:33:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So these sites
one could say were

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.005 align:middle line:84%
selected by the gods,
the ones with knowledge

00:33:55.005 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:84%
once upon a time that walked
the face of the Earth,

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:84%
being informed from
higher realms as well.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I assume these were identified
by more aware individuals

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.281 align:middle line:90%
in the incarnate realm, right?

00:34:05.281 --> 00:34:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these structures
were then constructed.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.700 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a two-way
exchange going on then, right?

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
just that the human

00:34:16.083 --> 00:34:19.960 align:middle line:84%
can go to these telluric
regions, these two tellurically

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:90%
energized regions and tap in.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But it must allow
for the other beings

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.386 align:middle line:84%
to be able to also reach
through those frequencies

00:34:27.386 --> 00:34:28.719 align:middle line:90%
to the humans who show up there.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
some of your own experience

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.524 align:middle line:90%
in that as well.

00:34:32.524 --> 00:34:33.324 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Whoo.

00:34:33.324 --> 00:34:34.280 align:middle line:90%
We'll be here for an hour.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.071 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, because
I love these stories.

00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:37.120 align:middle line:90%
This is two-way.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It all comes
from personal experience.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:39.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:41.722 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This is why it takes
me so long to write books.

00:34:41.722 --> 00:34:43.600 align:middle line:84%
No, actually in the
Native American culture,

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.159 align:middle line:90%
actually, they say it very well.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:90%
They talk about these reeds.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:84%
The original sacred sites were
actually landscaped temples.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Back then we could see easily.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:53.613 align:middle line:90%
We could see energy.

00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:90%
We could feel it.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:84%
You just had to
stand on it and go,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is a point
in the Earth's surface

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:84%
where the laws of physics are
so they enable the veil to be

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.430 align:middle line:90%
a little bit thinner.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:84%
As we began to forget
where these places are,

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.540 align:middle line:84%
when we stopped
seeing them, we had

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.630 align:middle line:84%
to build temples on top of them
to remind us of where to go.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.142 align:middle line:90%
It's a very simple concept.

00:35:12.142 --> 00:35:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But in the Native
American culture,

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:84%
they have, if you go
into a kiva especially,

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.130 align:middle line:84%
there's a big sort of
hearth in the center.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:19.870 align:middle line:84%
No one pays attention
to the little hole

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.630 align:middle line:84%
next to the hearth, which
is called the sipapu.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they say
there's a reed of heaven that

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.220 align:middle line:84%
comes from the sky
into the ground

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.079 align:middle line:84%
and it allows our spirit
to go into the heavens.

00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But it allows the spirit world
to come into the room as well.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-way exchange.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I found the same story
in Persia in 3500 BC,

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.770 align:middle line:84%
that they said, yes,
that's why we choose

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:44.486 align:middle line:84%
certain mountains above
others to be sacred mountains,

00:35:44.486 --> 00:35:46.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's where the
reed of heaven comes down.

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.866 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It allows the
information to come in.

00:35:48.866 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to
connect more easily.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I found the same story
also in Central America,

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:90%
and also in South America.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.240 align:middle line:90%
It's all around the Earth.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the funny part.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.830 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, NASA made this
extraordinary discovery,

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.820 align:middle line:84%
because we now have
the technology.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:84%
They said, and I
quote, I believe

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.090 align:middle line:84%
it's every 18 minutes,
don't quote me on this one.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But every 18 minutes
portals, magnetic portals

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.130 align:middle line:84%
open between the
Earth and the sun.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And information is
exchanged between the two.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering, where
exactly would these portals be?

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't had any
response from them yet.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.538 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I am pretty certain
that I know exactly where they

00:36:26.538 --> 00:36:29.310 align:middle line:84%
are, because it tells you
exactly these sacred places

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.730 align:middle line:84%
were exactly these portals
that the ancients were talking

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:30.810 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was oriented toward
the sun to begin with, right?

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.337 align:middle line:90%
Or the pole star.

00:36:36.337 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or the pole star, yes.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Here's a little
plug for Sedona, OK?

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I've never talked about
this publicly, actually.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.543 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it's just fair to
share, because a lot of people

00:36:44.543 --> 00:36:46.190 align:middle line:84%
come to Sedona now
on their vacation.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
entity that I just

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:52.430 align:middle line:84%
call the big genie, who lives
in this one particular cave that

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.550 align:middle line:84%
has been there for thousands,
and thousands of years, all

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.440 align:middle line:84%
through the various
indigenous tribes'

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:84%
inhabitation of this
area, called Palatki.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:10%
And you can see--

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.280 align:middle line:10%
you've been to Palatki, which
has stone drawings on it

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.130 align:middle line:10%
that they recognize to be
at least 10,000 years old,

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:10%
and all the way up to 500 years
old as the different tribes

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.030 align:middle line:10%
came through.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But in the ceremonial
cave at Palatki

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:84%
where there's that little water
pond at the base of it, that's

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.880 align:middle line:84%
where the big guy lives,
the big genie lives.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And this being-- what's
interesting to me

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.790 align:middle line:84%
is people look
around at the beauty

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're intrigued with
the remnants of the housing

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:31.760 align:middle line:90%
and so forth on the hillside.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
they're standing

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.960 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of an amazing
being who is literally

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.580 align:middle line:90%
there at their beck and call.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I'm glad you said
that, because I was there

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.941 align:middle line:84%
years ago when I was first
learning this material

00:37:40.941 --> 00:37:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and I felt drawn to
this particular area.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the ruins are nice, but
I want to be by this pool,

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:90%
because there's something--

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I feel like
I'm being watched.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the big guy.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And he lives there.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:90%
He's there all the time.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:57.190 align:middle line:84%
He's there for anyone that
has a request to begin anew.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.420 align:middle line:84%
That being is very good,
because so many people come

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.100 align:middle line:90%
to start a journey in Sedona.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:84%
That being just happens to be
perfectly attuned to helping

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:05.650 align:middle line:90%
one begin anew.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I just thought
I'd say that for anybody who

00:38:08.695 --> 00:38:09.990 align:middle line:90%
might be going to Sedona.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:11.115 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Now I feel better.

00:38:11.115 --> 00:38:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't forget
the big guy, the big genie

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.679 align:middle line:90%
in the grotto I call him.

00:38:14.679 --> 00:38:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they actually
didn't look at these temples

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:19.260 align:middle line:84%
as being physical
objects back in the day.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.210 align:middle line:84%
They actually described
them as being living,

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.044 align:middle line:90%
breathing organisms.

00:38:22.044 --> 00:38:22.843 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:22.843 --> 00:38:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And whether that's just
because of the spirit of place

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.990 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's because of the
combined experience of people

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.737 align:middle line:84%
over time, it ingrains
itself in the type of stone

00:38:30.737 --> 00:38:32.570 align:middle line:84%
that's at these places,
because the stone is

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:34.310 align:middle line:90%
different to other sites.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of quartz, so it
makes the site piezoelectric,

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.300 align:middle line:90%
by pressure.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of magnetite,
which tends to remember things.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And it acts also upon you,
because we are made of quartz.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.440 align:middle line:90%
We're silica in our bones.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.560 align:middle line:84%
We have magnetite flowing
by the billions of pieces

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.740 align:middle line:90%
in our brains.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So the temple is actually
a mirror of the human body,

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.530 align:middle line:84%
so it makes the connection
that much more easier.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.515 align:middle line:84%
And we now can also measure
the fact that in the morning--

00:38:57.515 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of these were
done at Avebury in England,

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.879 align:middle line:84%
and also in the
Carnac in France.

00:39:01.879 --> 00:39:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They actually planted
electrodes into the ground,

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and found that at sunrise,
or just before sunrise,

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:84%
the solar wind
suddenly vectors itself

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:13.010 align:middle line:84%
into the ground at these sites,
and like a big portal just

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:14.960 align:middle line:90%
opens at the entrance.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
called an en-trance.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Took me a while to
figure that one out.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.260 align:middle line:84%
The energy goes
through the en-trance,

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and it literally sucks all
the electromagnetic frequency

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:27.050 align:middle line:84%
of the surrounding landscape,
and circles it around the site.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And then at sunrise, it goes
right to the very center,

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:90%
the altar.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:31.650 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's called an altar.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So the site is living.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps breathing
throughout the day.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.781 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And just
like us it runs out

00:39:36.781 --> 00:39:38.840 align:middle line:90%
of energy towards the sunset.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And in the evening it
has a little lie-down.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.130 align:middle line:90%
It goes back to sleep.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.762 align:middle line:84%
And at sunrise, it
repeats the process.

00:39:45.762 --> 00:39:48.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I see that when I
am out walking in the rocks,

00:39:48.095 --> 00:39:51.260 align:middle line:84%
because I live not far from
Cathedral Rock in Sedona.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Going out on early morning
walks, especially walks

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.450 align:middle line:84%
in the summer, 6:30, 7
o'clock in the morning,

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the energy
that you're speaking of,

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.160 align:middle line:90%
the prana raining down.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's literally like
a shower of white particles

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.220 align:middle line:84%
pouring down into
the Earth, which is

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.996 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful, energizing time.

00:40:08.996 --> 00:40:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
taking that force--

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.369 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming that's what
you're speaking about--

00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and then concentrating it
into a very specific temple

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:19.480 align:middle line:84%
or natural site, that's
incredibly powerful.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've got
an actual diagram.

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It's actually of a
magnetometer survey.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a $40,000
piece of equipment that

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.230 align:middle line:90%
gets dragged along the ground.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was a stone circle in
England called the Rollright

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Stones.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.940 align:middle line:90%
This was back in 1973.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And the diagram actually
shows the three stones

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that are set aside
from the actual stone

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.504 align:middle line:84%
circle forming an entrance
barely perceptible to the eye.

00:40:41.504 --> 00:40:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It shows how the
energy is dragged

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:84%
from the local landscape and
it comes into the actual circle

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and starts going like a
spiral down to the center,

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:52.870 align:middle line:84%
like a big Alice in Wonderland
kind of rabbit-hole kind

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.040 align:middle line:90%
of experience.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is an actual
machine that actually

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.374 align:middle line:90%
shows this on a piece of paper.

00:40:58.374 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So the ancients
weren't making this stuff up.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:90%
This is what they were seeing.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.331 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
make sure that you

00:41:03.331 --> 00:41:05.495 align:middle line:84%
know where these places
for times when you forget.

00:41:05.495 --> 00:41:06.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:06.295 --> 00:41:08.020 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need
machines to perceive it.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Of course not.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:08.650 align:middle line:90%
They are the machine.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.983 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were the machine.

00:41:09.983 --> 00:41:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And we are too.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Is it called Kinka?

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Kenka?

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Kenko.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kenko.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:15.467 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I love that place.

00:41:15.467 --> 00:41:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about Kenko.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.135 align:middle line:84%
So we have so many
beautiful images.

00:41:18.135 --> 00:41:18.935 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:41:18.935 --> 00:41:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yes.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, Cusco, putting
this into context,

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:24.820 align:middle line:84%
the sites are
usually triangulated.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have Cusco, which so
many people are fascinated by,

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.360 align:middle line:90%
and they should be.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:84%
You have Saksaywaman
1,000 feet above.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
third site called Kenko.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And the three form
a perfect triangle,

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and I mean absolutely
perfect once you figure out

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.090 align:middle line:84%
where the original
portion of Saksaywaman is,

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:90%
because it's a very big place.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And this enormous
sandstone limestone butte

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.879 align:middle line:84%
has been hollowed
out from the inside.

00:41:47.879 --> 00:41:49.420 align:middle line:84%
On the outside,
there's a whole bunch

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.074 align:middle line:90%
of ledges that are carved.

00:41:51.074 --> 00:41:52.240 align:middle line:90%
And these stairs go nowhere.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.040 align:middle line:90%
There are altars.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.220 align:middle line:90%
There are basins.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.110 align:middle line:84%
But it looks like a big
piece of LEGO that's

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.210 align:middle line:90%
suddenly been amalgamated.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But there is a big
cut in the rock that's

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.870 align:middle line:90%
been deliberately sliced.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:03.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, hmm.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Compass comes out.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's the equinox sunset.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.210 align:middle line:90%
What am I getting myself into?

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And you follow the path
through the equinox sunset.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You turn right in a
big sort of S shape.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great
big altar that's

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.730 align:middle line:84%
carved out from the inside
of the boulder, where

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.280 align:middle line:84%
a person could spend a very
comfortable night or three

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.815 align:middle line:84%
inside having a small
out-of-body experience.

00:42:23.815 --> 00:42:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, because
it's not so regulated.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Not like Egypt.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And then, after this,
after you're in this womb,

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.570 align:middle line:84%
you basically come out
through another S shape.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.414 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, why not
just do a straight line?

00:42:37.414 --> 00:42:39.580 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to cut
this out of living rock?

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.663 align:middle line:90%
Why not just make it easy?

00:42:40.663 --> 00:42:41.702 align:middle line:90%
Make it a straight line.

00:42:41.702 --> 00:42:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, they had it
more in the S shape

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:45.035 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
energy that's there.

00:42:45.035 --> 00:42:46.432 align:middle line:90%
The energy follows that path.

00:42:46.432 --> 00:42:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, you come out

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.830 align:middle line:84%
into another specifically
cut courtyard.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:54.430 align:middle line:84%
They've completely chiseled
entire facades of rock

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:58.560 align:middle line:84%
to allow the equinox sunrise
to flood that courtyard,

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.140 align:middle line:84%
but also the rising of Venus,
only happens once every eight

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.050 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.091 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this beautiful
alignment like this.

00:43:05.091 --> 00:43:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, why would
they cut a rock like this?

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if you actually
do the mathematics,

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Venus actually follows that
trajectory of the rock.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.865 align:middle line:84%
That's what I call
bloody clever.

00:43:13.865 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is clever.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So it is
an initiation site.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And I found the same thing
in Tintagel in England.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.790 align:middle line:84%
There's also the same chamber
aligned to the same equinox

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:24.600 align:middle line:84%
positions, also carved
in the shape of an S.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you
stay overnight there?

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Too much of a work.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask if
you had an out-of-body--

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.436 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I've got
pressures on me.

00:43:31.436 --> 00:43:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --experience
while you were there.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:35.352 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I usually go there
just to acclimate well

00:43:35.352 --> 00:43:36.190 align:middle line:90%
to the altitude.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So I go there before people
show up for the tours

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and before other
tour groups happen.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.445 align:middle line:84%
And just 15 minutes
is enough for me,

00:43:43.445 --> 00:43:45.070 align:middle line:84%
because I'm so attuned
to these things.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:48.250 align:middle line:84%
After years of doing
this, it's second nature.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.002 align:middle line:84%
It becomes very easy to
do this once you just

00:43:51.002 --> 00:43:52.710 align:middle line:84%
take your breathing
right down rate down.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Just pop in.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Pop in and out.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And I come back down to
Cusco and I feel fine.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.330 align:middle line:84%
After 15 hours on a
plane, I feel really good.

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Who needs drugs?

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.290 align:middle line:90%
This is much better.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, when you have
such a saturation of energy.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:03.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:05.880 align:middle line:84%
I can't pronounce the
next one either, Freddy.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.680 align:middle line:90%
"Kill-ar."

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [INAUDIBLE] .

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.775 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is it?

00:44:08.775 --> 00:44:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That one.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: At least that's
what my guide said it.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.410 align:middle line:84%
That is the most
fascinating place.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit off the tourist
trail, which is good.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:23.255 align:middle line:84%
And I went there for the first
time not knowing much about it.

00:44:23.255 --> 00:44:25.130 align:middle line:84%
My guide actually
suggested that we go there.

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, I want
to learn something new.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.779 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
this, that, and the other.

00:44:29.779 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you
know, again, if I'm just

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.090 align:middle line:84%
an Egyptian standing here,
this makes a lot of sense.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.660 align:middle line:84%
We have the remains of
a beautiful small temple

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.690 align:middle line:84%
through which flows a
stream that's been diverted

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:42.097 align:middle line:90%
specifically to that location.

00:44:42.097 --> 00:44:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, well,
this is the best way

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:47.020 align:middle line:84%
to do ritual baptism and you
have the cleansing process.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a big
rock, massive monolith.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's a freestanding place.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And they've carved on the side
of this arc into the rock.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:58.610 align:middle line:84%
It's still so perfectly machined
that after thousands of years

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.490 align:middle line:90%
it has not eroded one bit.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
why is this here?

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So you take your
alignments, you do angles,

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and then you get your computer
out and figure it all out.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And you realize,
it's actually aligned

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.670 align:middle line:84%
to the complete phase of the
moon, which takes 19.47 years--

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.770 align:middle line:84%
sorry, 18.5 years to
complete the full northern

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.090 align:middle line:90%
to south cycle.

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So the actual angle takes in the
perfect position of the moon.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lunar site, and
it's also aligned perfectly

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.320 align:middle line:84%
to the rising of the equinox
and Venus and Sirius, which

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.670 align:middle line:84%
of course is the Egyptian
star of knowledge.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I'm going, a water
temple, the water, the moon.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:38.800 align:middle line:84%
This is an Isis temple,
if I was an Egyptian.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So if that was true, I would
then go to the top of the hill

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.090 align:middle line:84%
where there should
be a cave, where

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:44.430 align:middle line:90%
you do your final initiation.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.470 align:middle line:90%
It turns out actually there is.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So again you have
that mirror image,

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.270 align:middle line:84%
180 degrees opposite each
other on the face of the Earth,

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.870 align:middle line:84%
transplanted from Egypt
to Peru and back again.

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Same concept.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It's as though they're
writing from the same manual.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Looking from your
perspective, bringing Sirius

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:07.320 align:middle line:84%
up here, do you believe
Walter Cruttenden's work

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.489 align:middle line:84%
that Sirius is the binary
star companion to our sun?

00:46:11.489 --> 00:46:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I think it's possible.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah?

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: All things
being equal, why not?

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Because he's saying that's why
it might figure so prominently

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.730 align:middle line:84%
certainly in the Egyptian
mystery teachings.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And also, a lot of the
traditional cultures--

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of the
oldest cultures on Earth,

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:29.540 align:middle line:90%
they have specific stars.

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Orion always seems to
feature in everything.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:31.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:31.765 --> 00:46:33.796 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Again, going back
to Osiris and his association

00:46:33.796 --> 00:46:34.800 align:middle line:90%
with Orion.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Venus is very prominent.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Sirius is also a very prominent,
even in Native America.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.122 align:middle line:84%
So that's more than
just coincidence.

00:46:43.122 --> 00:46:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these people
obviously must

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.590 align:middle line:84%
have felt that there was
an importance to this.

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the
fact that shared

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.990 align:middle line:84%
across different cultures is
the association between Sirius

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and ancient knowledge
and the cult of Isis,

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:57.750 align:middle line:84%
or the divine virgin with
whom the initiate goes

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.292 align:middle line:84%
to marry when he crosses into
the other world and comes back.

00:47:00.292 --> 00:47:01.091 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:01.091 --> 00:47:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So there
are overlaps here,

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.660 align:middle line:84%
which seem to be more
than idle conjecture.

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And another connotation
of the moon's function

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.410 align:middle line:84%
is a place that receives
souls between incarnations

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:15.880 align:middle line:84%
while they're still on
Earth incarnation path

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.690 align:middle line:84%
until they're free to go
elsewhere, or go to the sun

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:20.590 align:middle line:84%
realm, or whatever
they've worked toward.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
these initiations

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.470 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about, as
seen through that lens

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of the place between
incarnations,

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:29.790 align:middle line:90%
would that makes sense?

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:30.889 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.180 align:middle line:90%
It's also the cleansing ritual.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, which
would be that as well.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.021 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because you
have to either cleanse

00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:37.790 align:middle line:84%
your body, in other words, the
idea of chopping up the person,

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:84%
which is why the
Aztecs got it so wrong.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to cut someone up
before they can transform

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.050 align:middle line:90%
to another level of reality?

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:44.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.641 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to remove
your physical self.

00:47:46.641 --> 00:47:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a flaying of the
self metaphorically

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.530 align:middle line:84%
so you can allow the spirit
to get out of the body.

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Leave this thing behind.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Get out of the body
as much as you can.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
initiation concept

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.500 align:middle line:84%
was also the
cleansing, the ritual

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.830 align:middle line:84%
of the moon presiding over
so many temples associated

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.870 align:middle line:84%
with the ritual
initiation, because you

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:05.070 align:middle line:90%
had to cleanse yourself.

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:08.079 align:middle line:84%
And the water usually was
very potentized, apparently.

00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:09.120 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just any water.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.840 align:middle line:90%
They called it living water.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.750 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about the actual energy

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:15.240 align:middle line:84%
of the water, where it
was or its relationship

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.580 align:middle line:84%
to the local geology, which
is why the temple is not

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.380 align:middle line:90%
over there.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It's here because that
geology is no good.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:22.165 align:middle line:90%
This geology is much better.

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
specific about this.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when you go to
holy wells and sacred springs

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.670 align:middle line:84%
in Europe and you take the
water from these places--

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:32.130 align:middle line:84%
which unless they're somewhere
in the middle of a city

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:34.070 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, it doesn't
really work anymore.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But out in the countryside
when you take the water,

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:38.077 align:middle line:84%
and you compare it
to normal tap water,

00:48:38.077 --> 00:48:39.410 align:middle line:90%
this water is highly potentized.

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.399 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's spinning with
millions of little vortices

00:48:42.399 --> 00:48:44.190 align:middle line:84%
going around in very,
very agitated states.

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So when you're drinking
this water, you, a being who

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.440 align:middle line:84%
is made of 2/3 water,
and you come there

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.690 align:middle line:84%
to a sacred site with
all your problems,

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:53.730 align:middle line:84%
well, now you're
already being energized.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.610 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
idea behind baptism

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and why the idea
of so many gods--

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that's going back
to Sumeria-- were

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:03.010 align:middle line:84%
portrayed as fishermen
or people who

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:04.530 align:middle line:84%
were associated
with gods of water

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:07.020 align:middle line:84%
were very fundamental to
the concept of the temple.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.850 align:middle line:84%
That was the foundation
of everything.

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And we end up finding this
traveling through, say, the god

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Oanna or Oannes--

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --who eventually
becomes the Greek version,

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.060 align:middle line:84%
which is John, as we would know
it in the Christian world John

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.049 align:middle line:90%
the Baptist.

00:49:21.049 --> 00:49:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
speaking of that,

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:23.890 align:middle line:90%
I had one of my most far-out--

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:24.870 align:middle line:90%
I've said this before--

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.810 align:middle line:84%
experiences in my life
at the little cave,

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:32.375 align:middle line:84%
in the little cave right above
the baptismal well, the John

00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:34.940 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist well,
which is now surround

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.950 align:middle line:90%
and protected by a monastery.

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm assuming
whatever was going on in

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that cave was also the same
substance that was potentizing

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.210 align:middle line:90%
his baptismal water.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:46.010 align:middle line:90%
That was something.

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And the sacred springs also,
as we now know in science,

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.067 align:middle line:90%
they also attract magnetism.

00:49:50.067 --> 00:49:50.866 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:50.866 --> 00:49:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:53.638 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And NASA also
came up with this.

00:49:53.638 --> 00:49:56.280 align:middle line:84%
They said, whenever we try
to look for magnetic lines

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.590 align:middle line:84%
of energy-- and
an actual quote--

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:00.750 align:middle line:84%
we first look for
underground springs of water,

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.030 align:middle line:84%
because the water is
attracting the magnetism.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:04.784 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And again,
it answers it

00:50:04.784 --> 00:50:06.270 align:middle line:84%
perfectly why some
of these places

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:07.939 align:middle line:90%
are really hard to get to.

00:50:07.939 --> 00:50:09.730 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just the fact
that as an initiate

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:11.396 align:middle line:84%
you can't just have
things given to you.

00:50:11.396 --> 00:50:13.375 align:middle line:90%
You have to work for it.

00:50:13.375 --> 00:50:16.091 align:middle line:84%
Unlike texting, you have
to work hard at this stuff.

00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No instant
gratification on that path.

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:20.400 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do the work.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it's too easy.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So these places
were specifically

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:24.754 align:middle line:84%
chosen because the
conditions were just

00:50:24.754 --> 00:50:26.951 align:middle line:84%
right to induce that
state of affairs.

00:50:26.951 --> 00:50:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now one of
them is really easy access,

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.602 align:middle line:90%
you know, famous water.

00:50:30.602 --> 00:50:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to ask
your opinion on this.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:37.960 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel about the water
at Chalice Well in Glastonbury?

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The one inside
the garden is wonderful.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inside the garden.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Not the other one.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, the one inside
the garden, the little one.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:45.470 align:middle line:90%
The little one in the garden.

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.742 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The other one
has been really, really--

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: City water?

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:49.986 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's
a fight about it.

00:50:49.986 --> 00:50:50.870 align:middle line:90%
There's two springs.

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:middle line:90%
There's a one spring.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying is the other
one essentially city water?

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Well, no.

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.290 align:middle line:90%
The other one is part of a--

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:00.675 align:middle line:84%
it's like a symbiotic
relationship between these two

00:51:00.675 --> 00:51:02.300 align:middle line:84%
springs that come
from the same source.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:02.404 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:51:02.404 --> 00:51:02.825 align:middle line:90%
I only know the one.

00:51:02.825 --> 00:51:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But one's on the
other side of the street

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.569 align:middle line:90%
and doesn't feel right.

00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The one in the garden
looks very different.

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.675 align:middle line:84%
And the fact, all you
have to do is sit there

00:51:08.675 --> 00:51:09.633 align:middle line:90%
and drink a little bit.

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.090 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop drinking it.

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And it has a high
content of iron.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
hill of Glastonbury

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:17.384 align:middle line:84%
is a big coil of energy,
so that acts on the water.

00:51:17.384 --> 00:51:18.800 align:middle line:84%
It goes through
the geology, which

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.120 align:middle line:84%
is limestone, which creates an
electromagnetic effect anyway.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.010 align:middle line:84%
We know that in
science to be true.

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So that energy goes
into the water.

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.697 align:middle line:84%
The water creates
vortices in it.

00:51:29.697 --> 00:51:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's what allows the
water to remember everything.

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So if you go there
with the right action,

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.920 align:middle line:84%
your prayers are memorized
and the next person

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.135 align:middle line:84%
drinks those prayers and they
add their two cents' worth.

00:51:40.135 --> 00:51:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Next person-- well, you see
the process repeating itself.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You go next
door, across the street,

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:46.733 align:middle line:84%
and people go there to do
all kinds of weird stuff

00:51:46.733 --> 00:51:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't feel right.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't even
know about the other one.

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I just knew the
one in the garden.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Forget about it.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't planning
to go there, OK?

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:55.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:58.040 align:middle line:84%
You just mentioned iron
and back to Sedona,

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.160 align:middle line:84%
all the vortices and the
huge amount of iron--

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Sandstone.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.043 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --which is why--

00:52:02.043 --> 00:52:03.380 align:middle line:90%
yeah, sandstone, iron.

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:05.614 align:middle line:84%
And so again, what
would that be offering?

00:52:05.614 --> 00:52:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, when the water
percolates through something

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.590 align:middle line:84%
like limestone or
sandstone, and especially

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.430 align:middle line:84%
if it has a lot of iron
packed in it, or iron oxide,

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:15.710 align:middle line:84%
it creates a process
called adsorption

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and it creates an
electromagnetic charge

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.400 align:middle line:90%
in the local landscape.

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And it only takes
a small change in

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:25.730 align:middle line:84%
the local electromagnetic field
for your DNA to react to it.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to say,
well, wait a minute.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a different
bit of information here.

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they chose
these sites, because there's

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.900 align:middle line:84%
information that's
been packed there

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.750 align:middle line:84%
since God knows how
long ago, 10,000,

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:37.670 align:middle line:90%
20,000, 50,000 years ago.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:39.595 align:middle line:84%
The information is
hard-wired into the sites,

00:52:39.595 --> 00:52:40.970 align:middle line:84%
which is why
they're still sacred

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.470 align:middle line:90%
and why we like going there.

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So this small alteration of the
local electromagnetic field,

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:48.490 align:middle line:84%
which is partly defined by
natural characteristics,

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.640 align:middle line:84%
but reshaped by
people, is why you

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.210 align:middle line:84%
are attracted to there,
to receive information,

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.020 align:middle line:84%
which your DNA then
picks up and says,

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.300 align:middle line:90%
ooh, I need to remember this.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
come out of these sites

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:02.046 align:middle line:84%
a slightly different person
than when you went in.

00:53:02.046 --> 00:53:03.920 align:middle line:84%
There's actually physics
now to back this up,

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.450 align:middle line:90%
that you're not making this up.

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:06.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not psychosomatic.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.480 align:middle line:84%
It can be if you want, but
that's not half the fun.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.613 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It actually is
changing something inside of you

00:53:12.613 --> 00:53:13.635 align:middle line:90%
on a molecular level.

00:53:13.635 --> 00:53:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Real magic.

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Practical magic I call it.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, to me one of
the most exciting experiences

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:24.140 align:middle line:84%
period is to be in
a magnetic storm,

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and also in the monsoon
season in Sedona.

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:28.400 align:middle line:90%
I like to be--

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I'll go right out
in the middle of it.

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:32.600 align:middle line:84%
When you have all
of the lightning

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and the rain and the red rocks
and the exchange of energy

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.760 align:middle line:84%
between the rocks and that,
there's nothing like it.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, god no.

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
sacred site north

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:46.370 align:middle line:84%
of Santa Fe called
Aguascalientes, used

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:47.650 align:middle line:90%
to be an Anasazi sacred site.

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:50.450 align:middle line:90%
And I like the Anasazi a lot.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And now there's a big sort
of natural spring with lots

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.350 align:middle line:90%
of lithium pools and things.

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like a spa.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
afternoon when you

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.360 align:middle line:84%
get that obligatory
thunderstorm that

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:02.560 align:middle line:84%
comes through New Mexico that
always lasts 5 and 1/2 minutes.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.224 align:middle line:84%
And they're screaming for
people to go in, because there's

00:54:05.224 --> 00:54:06.140 align:middle line:90%
lightning and thunder.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:07.209 align:middle line:90%
I like going out in it.

00:54:07.209 --> 00:54:08.008 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:54:08.008 --> 00:54:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I just covered
myself in hot mud.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm lying there and
I'm going, lightning.

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.319 align:middle line:84%
And at that altitude, rain
comes at you with drops

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:16.985 align:middle line:84%
that big and they
look like ice crystals

00:54:16.985 --> 00:54:18.290 align:middle line:90%
and they're pounding your body.

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:21.039 align:middle line:84%
And you've got this hot mud
and you've got these icicles.

00:54:21.039 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, this is nirvana.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I'm saying, you
know, I don't-- in England,

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.560 align:middle line:84%
we don't sue people,
so I'll write a waiver.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.579 align:middle line:90%
Just leave me out here.

00:54:28.579 --> 00:54:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only person
out there in the middle

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.970 align:middle line:90%
of a lightning storm.

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching these
people in the inside hiding

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.930 align:middle line:90%
from the rain.

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, didn't
we come here to get wet?

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a spa.

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:40.550 align:middle line:90%
The irony was kind of funny.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:41.383 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:54:41.383 --> 00:54:45.780 align:middle line:84%
It is so incredibly energizing
and cleansing-- cleansing too.

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:46.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Now we have Naupa Iglesia.

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Did I kind of almost
say that one right?

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Naupa Iglesia?

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Or as the locals
call it, Naupa Huaca.

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.585 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Which
kind of translates

00:54:57.585 --> 00:55:00.564 align:middle line:84%
into sort of a portal of
the gods, which tells you

00:55:00.564 --> 00:55:01.730 align:middle line:90%
everything you need to know.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:02.800 align:middle line:90%
It's the strangest place.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Aligns with
the Giza pyramids, right?

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in terms of
its function and--

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh That was
a weird discovery,

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:10.490 align:middle line:84%
because it's built
up-- you've got

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:13.580 align:middle line:84%
to understand that first of
all, it's really hard to get to.

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Then when you get
there, you find yourself

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:20.390 align:middle line:84%
in a very steep U-shaped
valley, and I mean really steep.

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I actually tell people
that come on my tours

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that unless you're really fit,
you don't want to go there.

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So you go up to the top
and middle of this cliff,

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly some local
crazy person a long time

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.520 align:middle line:84%
ago cut their way into
the actual mountain,

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and has this sort of
bluestone-shaped rock

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.041 align:middle line:84%
with three altars
carved into it.

00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It's the most beautiful thing.

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And there's like hot seats.

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that stands
there for just 10 minutes,

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:47.300 align:middle line:90%
you get this energy.

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.250 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what's important.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:51.850 align:middle line:84%
The connection to Egypt with
this sort of natural cave

00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:54.200 align:middle line:84%
that's been artificially
shaped is the fact

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that you have, first of all,
on the wall, a spirit door.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's a doorway
that's designed

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:03.180 align:middle line:84%
to the musical notation,
which is an Egyptian concept

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:07.010 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, not just
any haphazard dimension.

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a
door that goes nowhere.

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.960 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, those are called ka
doors, that's k-a, not c-a-r.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not car,
with your accent.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's a
joke there somewhere.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I haven't quite
figured that out.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.010 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians were
notorious punsters.

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.320 align:middle line:90%
They like puns.

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.537 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's literally a
doorway that goes nowhere.

00:56:22.537 --> 00:56:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And you think, what's the point?

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:24.920 align:middle line:90%
There was no statue here.

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.170 align:middle line:90%
There's no space for a statue.

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this is a
beautiful representation of it.

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place, if you
get your equipment out,

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:32.420 align:middle line:84%
there is an energy line
that goes right through it.

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Why, it's a spirit door.

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.454 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to travel
into another dimension.

00:56:36.454 --> 00:56:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was fun
until I look up at the ceiling.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.536 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this
natural alcove, which

00:56:40.536 --> 00:56:42.820 align:middle line:90%
has been shaped by human hands.

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.792 align:middle line:90%
And it has two unusual angles.

00:56:44.792 --> 00:56:47.000 align:middle line:84%
One of them is 60 degrees,
which to a builder, that's

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.390 align:middle line:90%
not unusual.

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:50.390 align:middle line:90%
The other one is 51 degrees.

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:54.470 align:middle line:84%
That is not a building angle,
unless if you're a traveling

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian and you
stand there and you

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:59.480 align:middle line:84%
go, 51 degrees and
60 degrees, why,

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:03.130 align:middle line:84%
that's the two slope angles
of the two big pyramids

00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:04.340 align:middle line:90%
on the Giza Plateau.

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly the same.

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was lost for
words at that point.

00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:11.577 align:middle line:84%
What is this doing here in
the middle of the Andes?

00:57:11.577 --> 00:57:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And why
do you say that this

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is built in accordance with
the principles of Osiris

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:16.940 align:middle line:90%
in particular?

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because so much of the
principles of the false door,

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:22.370 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions of
the actual space that

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:25.490 align:middle line:84%
show that the Earth energy
passes through that site, these

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:27.590 align:middle line:84%
are all initiation
principles that

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.990 align:middle line:84%
were hard-wired in
places like the pyramids

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:32.660 align:middle line:90%
or the Osireion in Abydos.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just shaped
in a different way.

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.860 align:middle line:84%
They were built exactly
to the same recipe,

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:37.970 align:middle line:90%
for the same purpose.

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're also
associated with Osiris,

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.880 align:middle line:84%
which again is the embodiment of
the natural law of the initiate

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.070 align:middle line:84%
crossing into the
other world, meeting

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:49.550 align:middle line:84%
the divine knowledge of the
gods, the laws of nature.

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:52.850 align:middle line:84%
You marry the divine virgin,
which embodies that concept,

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and you bring it back
into your daily life,

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:56.240 align:middle line:90%
and you carry on as normal.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I believe that
you had to basically follow

00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:01.562 align:middle line:90%
the trajectory.

00:58:01.562 --> 00:58:03.020 align:middle line:84%
In the place where
they built this,

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:06.080 align:middle line:84%
which was halfway up a cliff,
you have to go from the bottom

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:06.910 align:middle line:90%
to the top.

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:07.910 align:middle line:90%
You're raising yourself.

00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:10.130 align:middle line:84%
You go into the womb
and you come back down

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:11.385 align:middle line:90%
as a risen person.

00:58:11.385 --> 00:58:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So again the concepts are
very, very similar to something

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.110 align:middle line:90%
that I would find in Egypt.

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:19.082 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One final one,
the Sillustani and Cutimbo?

00:58:19.082 --> 00:58:20.416 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Sillustani and Cutimbo.

00:58:20.416 --> 00:58:22.665 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These were the
raising of the dead chambers?

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.410 align:middle line:84%
We only have like two
minutes left, so--

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ooh.

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, oddly enough,
they kind of look like this.

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:30.920 align:middle line:84%
The towers or the chullpas
of Cutimbo and Sillustani,

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.290 align:middle line:84%
orthodox view, they're places
where you bury the dead,

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:35.120 align:middle line:84%
except there's no one
really buried there.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And the few burials
were actually intrusive.

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:39.047 align:middle line:90%
They were built in Inca times.

00:58:39.047 --> 00:58:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And the local historians
say the same thing.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.546 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were built
for other reasons,

00:58:42.546 --> 00:58:45.200 align:middle line:84%
because the name that they
gave them before the Inca ever

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.940 align:middle line:84%
showed up was a place of
the soul, not for the soul,

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.100 align:middle line:84%
but of the soul, so it's
a place of facilitation.

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And the entrances to these
were very narrow, very tiny.

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.185 align:middle line:84%
They're about so
big, which means

00:58:57.185 --> 00:58:58.310 align:middle line:90%
you have to crawl in there.

00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Even as a tiny person, you
would have a hard time.

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.052 align:middle line:84%
Why would you need an
awkward entrance for a place

00:59:03.052 --> 00:59:04.010 align:middle line:90%
where someone's buried?

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.880 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make any sense.

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's a tiny
gap where light,

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:08.990 align:middle line:84%
a bit of light and
some air can go

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:12.170 align:middle line:84%
in there, which means it's built
for someone who wants to spend

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:13.730 align:middle line:90%
a few days locked inside there.

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And then someone
from the outside

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:18.480 align:middle line:84%
takes this block of rock
and allows you back out.

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And the give-away
was the fact that it

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:23.035 align:middle line:84%
faces the equinox
sunrise, so you go in,

00:59:23.035 --> 00:59:25.100 align:middle line:90%
you crawl into the sunset.

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.630 align:middle line:90%
You come back to the sunrise.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And the hills where
they were placed

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:30.341 align:middle line:84%
used to be surrounded
by Lake Titicaca.

00:59:30.341 --> 00:59:31.715 align:middle line:84%
And they were
always in the west.

00:59:31.715 --> 00:59:33.470 align:middle line:90%
They were islands in the west.

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you talk about
the stories of Osiris,

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:39.470 align:middle line:84%
or the grail stories, or any
other initiation stories,

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:43.010 align:middle line:84%
the place of initiation is
always an island in the west.

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So it follows again that
recipe of initiation,

00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:49.470 align:middle line:84%
so now we know what
the chullpas were for.

00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:51.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of breath.

00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, you should be.

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.522 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We've used up all
the adjectives and verbs.

00:59:55.522 --> 00:59:56.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Freddy,
that's wonderful.

00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:00.060 align:middle line:10%
Also, you also have your
release of the book,

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.257 align:middle line:10%
"A Lost Art of
Resurrection" is out, right?

01:00:02.257 --> 01:00:03.090 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:06.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And we already did an
interview on that one, so yeah.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.160 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.660 align:middle line:10%
And I basically
used it as an excuse

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.940 align:middle line:10%
to add more, 48
pages of information.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.950 align:middle line:90%

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:13.889 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so thank you.

01:00:13.889 --> 01:00:15.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just a pleasure as always.
