>>REGINA MEREDITH: In
my last conversation

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:10%
with Michael
Murphy, we discussed

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:10%
what humanity is being
subjected to from our skies

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:10%
based on his film "What in
the World Are They Spraying?"

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.350 align:middle line:84%
In this conversation,
we'll continue

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
by talking about the
motivations for poisoning

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:84%
our environment, crops,
forests, and people.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
jump right into it.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.940 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's do a
little, short recap of what

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:90%
in the world they're spraying.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.409 align:middle line:84%
It's been a few days since they
saw the last one, so give us

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:90%
an idea of what that was about.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.283 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL MURPHY: Right. "What
in the World Are They Spraying"

00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:10%
was an investigation into
geoengineering programs.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.655 align:middle line:10%
And we really focused on
geoengineers' proposals

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:10%
of spraying 10 to 20 million
tons of toxic aluminum

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:10%
and other particles into
our sky for what they said

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:10%
was the stated goal
of cooling our planet.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:84%
In the film, we reviewed
a number of tests.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Ray tests are a very
effective indicator

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:90%
of atmospheric contamination.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And what's being
found around the world

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.775 align:middle line:84%
as the primary ingredients in
geoengineering programs, which

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
are aluminum, barium,
and strontium.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
What we see in the
sky on a regular basis

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
are these long trails
that do not dissipate.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
They actually spread
out and block the sun.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.085 align:middle line:84%
And this is an express goal of
geoengineering-- geoengineers.

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
There are also number of
patents actually designed

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to specifically spray
aluminum, barium, and strontium

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:84%
into our sky for, again,
geoengineering purposes.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So, again, what we see in the
sky matches what geoengineers

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.780 align:middle line:84%
deny they're doing but
state that they want to do.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And what we're finding
around the world

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:84%
matches not only what
geoengineers are proposing,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:84%
but a number of
engineering patents

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
designed to specifically
spray these toxins

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
into the planet,
which are very toxic.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
We discussed the ecological
and human health implications,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:90%
which are just unquantifiable.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
There has been no
greater threat,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
not only to the people on this
planet, but to our ecology.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
We now see forests around
the world collapsing.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.982 align:middle line:84%
And we're losing our ability
to grow natural, organic foods.

00:02:17.982 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good summary.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the most
important topic out there.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not one we can afford
to turn our eyes away

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:90%
from anymore.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.650 align:middle line:84%
We really have to
address it now.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've been into it for
the last 12, 13 years,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
researching it as well, as
we've talked about off camera.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And then one of
the biggest things

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:84%
is just the inability of people
to believe that something that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:90%
dastardly could be going on.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
When you say, no,
look at those long

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:90%
trails for horizon to horizon.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Wait another hour and watch.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.049 align:middle line:90%
They will have puffed up.

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to have a cloud
cover, because usually there

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of them
at the same time.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I've even shown them photographs
of the little matchstick

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.460 align:middle line:84%
contrail behind a
normal jet versus

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.549 align:middle line:90%
these expanive chemtrails.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people just
don't want to hear it.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.869 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think we
can turn our back.

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Well, we can't.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:84%
We have a planet that is
in the most dire situation

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:90%
than it has ever been.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And we have
aluminum-related illnesses

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:90%
going through the roof.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
We now have ecosystems
collapsing around the world.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Aluminum is very toxic
to not only our soils

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
but also to plant
life that depends

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:90%
on a natural, organic soil.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing
is the sterilization

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.314 align:middle line:90%
of our soils around the world.

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And of our bodies.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: And of our bodies.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:90%
And this planet gives us life.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:90%
It gives us food.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And we are watching
it slowly, slowly die,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:84%
as well as the layer, which
is the ozone layer, which

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
geoengineers are very
outspoken about the fact

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
that their programs
will shred our ozone.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.607 align:middle line:84%
We now have huge holes in
our ozone, a major depletion.

00:03:58.607 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Major depletion.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
talking about body,

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about huge rises
in the incidence of asthma,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
upper respiratory
conditions, Alzheimer's.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:84%
All of these have
aluminum implicated.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
We know that those are the side
effects-- not side effects--

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:84%
These are the effects of
aluminum toxicity in the body.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go to a clip
in the video to start.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:90%
This is by Dane Wigington.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Just really quickly, set
up who Dane is for us.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Because he does a
really nice summary

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of what we're looking at
here, what the problem is.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Dane is a researcher,
used to work for Bechtel.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And he owns one of the
largest solar-powered homes

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.520 align:middle line:90%
in northern California.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Started noticing between 50%
to 70% declines in his ability

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
to uptake solar
power and noticed

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.050 align:middle line:84%
a correlation
between the trails.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So he came into this issue,
researched it for a while,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and before long, came into
the issue of geoengineering,

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
got involved with
some of the testing.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:84%
He spoke to a number of people
in the EPA, high-level people

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:84%
in the office, and started
working with scientists

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:90%
in doing his research.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And what he found was,
again, very shocking:

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:84%
high amounts-- very high
amounts-- of aluminum, barium,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and strontium, the chemtrail
geoengineering footprints

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
of rain tests that were
taken in his region.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So he's been very active
in getting the word out

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:90%
about this most dire issue.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's go ahead
and look at that bite right now.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think he does
a wonderful job

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:84%
of summarizing what
we're up against here.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%

is no greater or

to the weather.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has to be
an extreme challenge

for the weathermen on
the various stations

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:90%
around this country.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Because they're telling us
basic baloney all the time.

at another bite
in just a moment,

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
but how can they possibly
predict the weather when

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
the weather is being altered

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, without
question, aerosols

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
are required to
modify the weather.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And we did our
research and we came

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
across a former 20-year,
award-winning weather

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:84%
man named Scott Stevens, who
became aware of this issue

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:90%
when he was in the industry.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.669 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed storms
were behaving differently.

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:90%
They were reacting differently.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed a correlation
between the trails

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:90%
and the aerosols.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So again, he stated
without question aerosols

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:84%
are required to modify and
manipulate our whether.

will manipulate,
will modify, actually

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
create droughts in
certain areas and floods

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:84%
in other areas, exactly
what we're seeing.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.044 align:middle line:84%
But we also spoke with
Mark McCandlish, who is--

00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to get to him.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
there's another point

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about off
camera, which is important.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So these guys-- the weathermen
have to be looking-- it's

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:84%
their job to look at the
weather and talk about it.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:84%
They have to be asking some
questions at this point.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:90%
As you say, Steve did.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And we'll listen to what he
had to say in just a sec.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But off camera, what
you were telling

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
me was this is all
controlled information.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.740 align:middle line:84%
The weathermen have to go
off of what is told to them,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.167 align:middle line:84%
given to them, by the
National Weather Service.

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: That is correct.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us the rest
of the story about that.

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, we
did have a time where

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
a number of weathermen put
together their own forecasts.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of them,
if not all, follow

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.135 align:middle line:84%
a script, what's
reported to them.

00:07:52.135 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they go and
they make their forecast

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and they deliver
that to the public.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there used
to be military meteorologists

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:90%
once upon a time.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had to
know their stuff.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yes.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And that information
is controlled.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Raytheon has an
involvement with that.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
They also have a number
of related patents, which

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:84%
are related to HAARP, which
we'll talk about when we speak

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
about Mark McCandlish and Dr.
Nick Begich, who is a HAARP

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:90%
expert.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So The
National Weather Service

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.652 align:middle line:84%
is under the
control of Raytheon?

00:08:19.652 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, we're
going to be looking

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
into that in "Who in
the World is Spraying?"

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:90%
and really connect the dots.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:90%
But really what--

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.193 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's terrible.

00:08:28.193 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't heart that.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you
fight with that?

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually, you can.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Easier, I suppose, to
work with a corporation,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.123 align:middle line:84%
even if they have
long-reaching tentacles,

00:08:39.123 --> 00:08:41.377 align:middle line:90%
than a governmental agency.

00:08:41.377 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yes.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.668 align:middle line:84%
But "Why in the World
are They Spraying?"

00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
really documented the
effects and how aerosols

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:84%
work in conjunction
with other technology

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:90%
to modify our weather.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And what we did, we
documented that this is real.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:90%
This is not speculation.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:84%
We've actually had
this technology

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:90%
around for quite a while.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So Scott elaborated on-- he
started noticing about a day

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
or two ahead of storms, we'd
see these real heavy spray

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
days, just the planes
back and forth,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.725 align:middle line:84%
back and forth, literally
creating a canopy of aerosols.

00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:13.641 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He couldn't
ignore it after a while.

00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to that
clip of him talking

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.054 align:middle line:84%
about his own experience as
a weatherman with chemtrails.

00:09:18.054 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Sounds good.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's take a look.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.215 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:10%
>>My name is Scott Stevens.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:10%
I was a television
weatherman for 20 years.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:10%
These chemtrails are
absolutely required

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:10%
to impact whatever weather
event they were designing.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And the trails were an absolute
necessary ingredient for them

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
to achieve their weather
modification goals.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're finding the aerosols,
the metal particulates,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:84%
all of those can be used
and leveraged to create

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:84%
weather events that are
several standard deviations,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.999 align:middle line:84%
or outside what would
be typically normal.

00:09:52.999 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
When the geoengineering really
got underway with the Russians

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:84%
in the mid '70s, we ended
up with snow in Miami.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:84%
We ended up with frost
deep into Mexico.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
The bizarreness of the weather
really exploded on the scene

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.717 align:middle line:84%
when weather engineering
got going in the mid-'70s.

00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.888 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
phenomena going

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:84%
on where it's snowing
where it shouldn't be.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the temperatures
are too high for snow.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.090 align:middle line:90%
What is that called?

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.954 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you and Scott
Stevens have talked about this.

00:10:18.954 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, we've had
a number of snow events

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that occur typically in the
40s or even close to the 50s.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we were
children, it typically

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
snowed around 32
degrees or below.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's being
pushed near the 50s.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
In our research, we came
across a patent actually owned

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:90%
by NASA.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's called Ice Nucleation
for Weather Modification.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And it enables corporations
or these people

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to create artificial
snow storms.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And as crazy as that sounds, if
we look into governments doing

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
this, actually the
Chinese government

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:84%
was boasting about doing
this until they did over

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:84%
a billion dollars worth
of damage in Beijing.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they
quit talking about it.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So if the Chinese can
do this, and if there's

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:84%
technology to do
it, why would we

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
believe that weather
events here that

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:84%
are occurring above 40,
45 degrees, are natural?

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is a heavy,
it's a very wet snow,

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that literally when it
falls, because it's so heavy,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and because it's so wet,
it's breaking branches.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:90%
It's destroying forests.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.969 align:middle line:90%
It's caving in roofs.

00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's doing a lot of damage.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those massive
kinds of hail storm balls--

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:84%
they're not little, tiny
hailstorm balls, but golf

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
balls now a lot of
times because of that.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.483 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yes.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's because the climate
now is being pushed and pulled

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:90%
in many different directions.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you push
and pull a climate,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:90%
there's going to be backlash.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be offsets.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:84%
There's going to
be snow in Miami

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.470 align:middle line:84%
when they started this in the
'70s, as Scott had discussed.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing weather that
is unusual across the board.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Some days it will
be snowing and then

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
back up to 75 the next
day in normal regions.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And these, again,
are consequences

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:84%
that geoengineers talk about,
off-set weather patterns,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:90%
exactly what we're seeing.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:02.371 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking at how
this technology is driven,

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.780 align:middle line:84%
we can't ignore the subject of
HAARP in looking at chemtrails.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
H-A-A-R-P. Both Mark
McCandlish in your film and Dr.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Nick Begich talk about this.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed Nick a
few times on this subject.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And because it's a
large chunk, and we

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:84%
can't show that entire
excerpt of the documentary,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
can you go ahead and then
just take the next few minutes

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
to explain to us how HAARP
is implicated in this?

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Absolutely.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And again, the aerosols-- what
we found-- geoengineers state

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:90%
aluminum is very reflective.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Its lightweight.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And it would be effective
for reflecting sunlight.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
What we also found out, it's
a very effective conductor

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:90%
into our sky.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And when they put these
heavy aerosols into our sky,

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
they have the ability through
microwave technology, or even

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
the HAARP technology,
to actually heat up

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:52.490 align:middle line:90%
the atmosphere.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:90%
HAARP is an ionospheric heater.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And by heating up
the atmosphere,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.029 align:middle line:84%
it actually creates a
lift in our atmosphere.

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you get a
lift, you actually

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.530 align:middle line:90%
create a low-pressure vacuum.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And it enables
these corporations

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
to steer storms into
certain regions.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Or in the case of this past
summer, out of certain regions.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
It also has the ability
to manipulate jet streams.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Nick Begich spoke about
a 60-mile deviation in a jet

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
stream back a couple years ago,
which literally swung storms

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:84%
into southern
Florida, where they

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.711 align:middle line:90%
had very, very unusual weather.

00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
weather maps now,

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
we see very, very unusual
jet stream patterns.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
We see patterns that, for
instance, this weekend

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:84%
went all the way
from the Alaska area

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:84%
down towards-- past Mexico,
down into the Mexico region

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
and back up.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:84%
As a result, we had all
this record cold air

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.829 align:middle line:84%
that rushed into
Arizona, California.

00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:54.245 align:middle line:84%
Arizona had freezing
temperatures.

00:13:54.245 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
isn't unusual anymore.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
The last few years,
I'm always shocked.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.605 align:middle line:84%
Because I look on
my iPhone-- I'm

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.230 align:middle line:84%
always kind of going
through and seeing

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.146 align:middle line:84%
what the weather's like
everywhere each day, I

00:14:03.146 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:90%
kind of check around.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And there are just
unusually cold temperatures.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I know that this year we
nearly lost-- and we may have.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:90%
When I get home, I'll find out.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.834 align:middle line:84%
We may have lost our citrus
crop, Mandarin oranges.

00:14:13.834 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is becoming
something you

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with
almost every year now,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
is are you going to lose the
crop by mid-season or not?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is true, going
into Arizona in particular,

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
these record lows where you
have freezing temperatures

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:90%
in Phoenix.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.115 align:middle line:90%
This isn't normal.

00:14:27.115 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Absolutely.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not normal at all.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And what we found, even
this past summer, because

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:84%
geoengineers talk
about their programs

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:84%
creating droughts in
certain areas and floods

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:90%
in other areas.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:84%
We looked back to what
created this drought.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And what was really
shocking the past summer,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
there were very
few visible trails

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:84%
above California and
above the West coast.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So we started
looking on satellite.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:84%
What we found, the
entire Pacific,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
all the way from the
equator up to Alaska,

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:90%
was covered with aerosol.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And this prevented
a couple of things.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
It prevented the sun actually
from coming in and hitting

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.347 align:middle line:84%
the water, which prevented the
normal evaporation in the cloud

00:15:07.347 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
formation that was required for
the summer storms to come in.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And another thing, these
particles act as what's called

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:90%
cloud condensation nuclei.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you put aerosols
into the atmosphere,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:84%
instead of water molecules
evaporating and actually

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:84%
combining with one another and
eventually falling as rain,

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:84%
they combine on the
metal particulate,

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:90%
and they simply drift.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So as a result, again, you
get droughts in certain areas

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:90%
and floods in other area.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:84%
This past summer, of course,
we had a record drought

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
in the Midwest, which
created a global food crisis.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We now have over 1,000
children dying per hour

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:90%
as a result of this.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Globally,
1,000 an hour.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.191 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Globally.

00:15:47.191 --> 00:15:50.916 align:middle line:84%
But Europe got the weather and
got the rain that, I think,

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:90%
the US was supposed to get.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Because they had record floods.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.656 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is a
consequence of geoengineering.

00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:57.571 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, when you
were researching this,

00:15:57.571 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
you find that there is kind
of a timetable to all of this.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
There will be an
approaching front.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Where do they
start-- at what point

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:84%
do they start intervening
with the trails?

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Usually about
500 to 1,000 miles out.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.695 align:middle line:84%
And again, they have the
ability to steer storms

00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:90%
into certain regions.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.528 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 500 to 1,000.

00:16:14.528 --> 00:16:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So that would
depend on the wind,

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, in terms of how
far out, how many days out they

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:90%
would start spraying.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.466 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: There are a number
of factors that depend on it.

00:16:25.466 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:90%
But one thing is for sure.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
engineer a storm

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that has an impact 1,000,
2,000 miles away if you start

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:84%
engineering into
a certain region.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this
is so far reaching.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.355 align:middle line:84%
So they have the
ability to use this

00:16:39.355 --> 00:16:40.880 align:middle line:90%
for many different applications.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be used
as a warfare application.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Because you can actually
start these programs

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
in your regions, which
we'll be talking about.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.921 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to go
into that in just a second.

00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And lest anyone think that this
is relatively new technology,

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I know just from
researching HAARP

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:84%
back when I believe that
was a joint Soviet-US

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:84%
project originally, the
development of HAARP,

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.329 align:middle line:84%
back in the late
'60s, early '70s.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
It was quite a long
time ago, as I recall.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: It may have been.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
Weather control has been
around for a very long time.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.026 align:middle line:84%
It was probably perfected
back in the Vietnam War.

00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what I wanted
to go to next.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.955 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead, please.

00:17:15.955 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: And it was
used in a project called

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:10%
Project Popeye, where the
US government actually

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.829 align:middle line:10%
used this technology to flood
out the Ho Chi Minh trail.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.900 align:middle line:10%
As a result, they
crippled the Vietnamese

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:10%
by eliminating that
main supply line.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
We actually covered a document
in "Why in the World Are They

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Spraying ," which was called
"Owning the Weather by 2025."

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
That's an express goal
by the US government.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:90%
And the objective is--

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.998 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How arrogant.

00:17:40.998 --> 00:17:42.172 align:middle line:90%
Owning the weather.

00:17:42.172 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Owning the weather.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So the objective is really
to control the weather

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and weaken the enemy.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
create weather conditions

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
in a far off country
without firing a shot

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:90%
or using propaganda.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a very effective tool
because you can weaken an enemy

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:90%
or create conditions in which--

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is,
as you said before, been

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
a time-honored tradition,
using weather modification

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:90%
as a part of wartime strategy.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And you did address
that in this film.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.866 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
take a quick look.

00:18:13.866 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a two- or
three-minute clip,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:84%
actually, of the history of
using weather modification

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.326 align:middle line:90%
to military advantage.

00:18:19.326 --> 00:18:20.076 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:18:20.076 --> 00:18:20.742 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:20.742 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:10%
>>Weather has always
been a strategic desire

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:10%
to control by the generals,
whether it was Napoleon

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:10%
marching towards Moscow or
Hitler and his Russian campaign

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.270 align:middle line:10%
or our own Pacific fleet trying
to understand typhoons and use

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:10%
them for our
strategic advantage.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
War and weather are
very closely connected.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And they've been connected
ever since about 1812 or so,

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.390 align:middle line:90%
maybe earlier than that.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Hannibal had to face
the snows in the Alps.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a long history
of weather and warfare

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:90%
interactions.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Environmental manipulation
is like the ultimate method

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.812 align:middle line:84%
of covert warfare,
because you can literally

00:19:00.812 --> 00:19:02.264 align:middle line:90%
shut down food production.

00:19:02.264 --> 00:19:06.136 align:middle line:84%
You can create a situation where
the people within a country

00:19:06.136 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:84%
revolt against their
own government.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:84%

as I think '94, '95 even.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But you go back to
these earlier reports,

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and you look at, what
was the objective?

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:10%
And the objective is exactly
that, control the battlefield

or obscure a beach
when there's a landing,

or if you just want to make
money on the futures market.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:10%
>>Owning the weather by 2025
using the weather as a force

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:10%
multiplier-- and
this kind of goes

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.230 align:middle line:10%
back to what I was saying
before about if you can control

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:10%
where a weather system
goes and how much

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:10%
or how severe the
weather system is, then

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:10%
you can do other things.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Like you may have
heard more recently

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.950 align:middle line:84%
that many of the aircraft
that we've been developing

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:84%
are what they call
all-weather capable,

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.241 align:middle line:84%
which means that they could
fly in any kind of weather.

00:20:23.241 --> 00:20:26.250 align:middle line:84%
They can shoot and
target the enemy

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.642 align:middle line:84%
under really nasty
weather circumstances.

00:20:29.642 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And these are all things that
you can use to your advantage

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.141 align:middle line:84%
if you happen to be
controlling the weather also.

00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:10%
Because you can have
a terrible storm front

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.730 align:middle line:10%
come in and make it
difficult, if not impossible,

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:10%
for the enemy to
operate on the ground

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.973 align:middle line:10%
or to fly their aircraft if
they don't have aircraft that

00:20:44.973 --> 00:20:47.300 align:middle line:10%
are as sophisticated as
the ones that you have.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:10%
And so by creating or using the
weather as a force multiplier,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:10%
as the title implies, that
you can achieve an advantage

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:10%
over an enemy force that
gives you the upper hand.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the ideals
of the Air Force

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
is to have this
all-weather Air Force,

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:84%
or to have their pilots
coming back safely and using

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
the weather as a salient
against the enemy

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and clearing out
their own airports

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
from, say, from ice fogs
or from bad weather.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea here
is that if we can fly

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and they can't, that's a
great military advantage.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:84%
There was also research
studies on hurricanes.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:84%
The scientists
were truly curious

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.340 align:middle line:84%
about the behavior
of hurricanes.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But their military
patrons were very

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:84%
interested in how to
steer them or direct them

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.387 align:middle line:84%
in certain ways, almost
as a guided weapon.

00:21:36.387 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.160 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.886 align:middle line:84%
And what we need
to talk about now

00:21:39.886 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:84%
is something that's
really interesting.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.968 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
actually treaties

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
based on this stuff,
which is interesting

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:84%
because the scientists,
the geoengineers,

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.434 align:middle line:84%
deny that this program
even exists, right?

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Right.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And yet they've
had to create treaties

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.330 align:middle line:10%
on this very
technology, regarding

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.546 align:middle line:10%
this very technology, right?

00:21:58.546 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about what these
environmental treaties are

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:10%
about.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, in the
'70s, there was a treaty,

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:84%
an environmental treaty,
called The ENMOD Treaty.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And what it did, it
banned weather warfare

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:90%
in warfare applications.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
a good treaty,

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:84%
but we looked into this, and
Dr. Nick Begich informed us,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.300 align:middle line:84%
there's a loophole
in this treaty.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.200 align:middle line:10%
And the loophole
is this-- countries

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:10%
can use this technology
over their own soil.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:10%
And as Scott Stevens
and Dr. Nick Begich

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:10%
illustrated with this, when
you modify the weather,

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:10%
you can literally modify
storms thousands of miles away.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So when a storm gets to
the border of the US,

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't say, oh, wait.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:90%
There's and ENMOD treaty.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
I can't go any further.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:90%
It fails to recognize this.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So it literally is a
loophole that should not even

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:90%
be allowed.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of
the reasons why they're

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.991 align:middle line:84%
getting away with such
damaging programs.

00:22:48.991 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
at the same time,

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:84%
we have these devastating
global events that occur.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the most obvious one
we can look at is Katrina.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And I know at the
time, fingers were

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
pointed at HAARP and at
the chemtrail program,

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.444 align:middle line:84%
by those who understand
those things,

00:23:05.444 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:84%
once-- following in
the wake of Katrina.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on there?

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:84%
If you have the ability
to steer theses storms

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and place them where you want
or dissipate them if you want,

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:84%
did you get any
clue as to why they

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.293 align:middle line:84%
allow them to wreak
such devastation?

00:23:22.293 --> 00:23:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Well, absolutely.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
objectives that can be met.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know FEMA got a
lot of additional funding

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:90%
after Hurricane Sandy.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And that could have
been-- that's speculation,

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.194 align:middle line:84%
but it could have been
one of the objectives.

00:23:35.194 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
What we do know in looking
at Sandy and Scott Stevens,

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:84%
again, meteorologist in our
film, spoke heavily about this.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Right before it made a 90 degree
turn right into the New York

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
area, there was heavy
aerosol activity.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, that
aerosol activity,

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:84%
the aerosols can
be heated, lifted,

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
can be used to make

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.700 align:middle line:84%
a hurricane take
a turn like that.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.635 align:middle line:84%
So without question, that
storm was manipulated.

00:24:00.635 --> 00:24:03.590 align:middle line:84%
It was steered into
the New York area.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
brings up the subject

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:84%
of who stands to
gain from this, which

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is part of the motivation and
thus the "Why in the World"

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:90%
they are spraying.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I was
shocked to find out

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:84%
there is such a thing as weather
derivatives, for example.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is obviously
a highly esoteric area

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.420 align:middle line:90%
of trading.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: One thing
that my jaw literally

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
dropped when I heard that
weather was being traded

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say
it a second time,

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:90%
because I had to hear it twice.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Weather is being traded as
a derivative on the Chicago

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.385 align:middle line:90%
Mercantile Exchange.

00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:90%
So I made a few phone calls.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:90%
And I contacted a trader.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.640 align:middle line:90%
His name was Michael Agne.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And he informed me about
weather derivatives

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and what corporations would
be interested in using them.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And he used the example of
like a heating company, a gas

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:57.920 align:middle line:84%
company in a winter, that
might require x number of days

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:90%
to be below 30 degrees.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
particularly warm winter,

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.557 align:middle line:84%
like they're having
across the US this summer,

00:25:04.557 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:84%
a company would invest
in these, essentially

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:90%
to offset their risk.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Another example, which I
think was very telling,

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:90%
was a seed company.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a seed
company that has $5 million

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:21.742 align:middle line:84%
worth of seed in the Midwest,
and you have a particularly dry

00:25:21.742 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:90%
summer, like they did--

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yes.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting into
the big conspiracy, right?

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Well, we'll get into--

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Monsanto.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.330 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do that.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: --that in a second.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But this isn't related
yet to Monsanto.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you're the
seed company, and you

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:84%
have $10 million-- or $5
million worth of crop,

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:84%
but you invest in $10
million of derivatives

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and your crop
fails, you actually

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:90%
make money when the crop fails.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.655 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying every
company benefits by--

00:25:47.655 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Certainly the
small farmer doesn't.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Or everybody who's
involved in these derivatives

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.890 align:middle line:84%
is behind weather control
and weather modification.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:84%
But there are
certain corporations

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.790 align:middle line:84%
that do know the weather agenda,
that do have the playbook.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the playbook,
and you have the ability to bet

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:90%
on that, you cannot lose.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
There are literally billions
of dollars being made annually

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.655 align:middle line:84%
just by people playing with
derivatives on this market that

00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:12.580 align:middle line:90%
have the playbook.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So basically this
takes out any sort of purity

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.215 align:middle line:84%
from the futures or commodity
markets I would think.

00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, there's
a lot of speculation.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:84%
But without question,
again, certain people

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.740 align:middle line:84%
make billions and
billions of dollars

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.380 align:middle line:90%
from weather-related disasters.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:90%
And we know that--

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:29.602 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
happening, I'm

00:26:29.602 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:84%
wondering, to people who
are trading straight up,

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:90%
like the way they always traded.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
You've always had
to be concerned

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
with what the weather is when it
comes to commodities and such.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.470 align:middle line:90%
What are they experiencing?

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Are they just kind of like
throwing their hands up?

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I think a
number of people are.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:44.981 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
Michael explained to us,

00:26:44.981 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:84%
every commodity or just
about every commodity,

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is based on the ability to
effectively predict weather.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So, again, if you
can effectively

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:84%
predict whether, which certain
people do have the playbook,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:90%
you can't lose.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.730 align:middle line:90%
And this is a shift in power.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Certain individuals, again,
are making billions of dollars

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.490 align:middle line:84%
at the expense, literally,
of every living thing--

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every living system.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.823 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: --on the planet.

00:27:05.823 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have a really good
bite here in the documentary.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to take a
look at this clip having

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to do with the economic
implications of these programs,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:84%
these weather
modification programs.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>So climate control, or
attempted climate control,

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and weather control lie on
this very large spectrum

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
of intervention.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:84%
It's also true that if
you can forecast climate,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:84%
you can control a lot
of futures markets.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And you could know if you
had the best information

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
or if you had some leverage
over what the climate system was

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:84%
going to turn out to be,
you would be able to invest

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
in advance in all
your crop futures

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and your agricultural
activities.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And not just
agriculture, but weather

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.190 align:middle line:84%
affects-- I think it's something
like 80% of the US economy

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.123 align:middle line:90%
is weather-sensitive.

00:27:49.123 --> 00:27:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And so all kinds
of businesses would

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:84%
like to see some weather edge,
some advantageous information

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.930 align:middle line:90%
that they would have.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:10%
>>It's absolutely
entirely possible

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:10%
to profit from the weather.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:09.425 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.425 --> 00:28:09.925 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

00:28:09.925 --> 00:28:11.040 align:middle line:90%
My name is Michael Agne.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.005 align:middle line:84%
I'm an independent trader
trading commodities

00:28:14.005 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:90%
at the CME Group.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm a member of the
Chicago Board of Trade

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.817 align:middle line:84%
and have traded derivatives and
futures cash for over 15 years.

00:28:20.817 --> 00:28:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, weather derivatives
are financial instruments

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.280 align:middle line:84%
that firms would use
to hedge risk concern

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.895 align:middle line:90%
with adverse weather conditions.

00:28:26.895 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The first weather
derivative was originally

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.740 align:middle line:90%
traded by Enron back in 1997.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Weather derivatives started
in 1999 at the CME group.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Big utilities, reinsurers,
to hedge against hurricanes

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.980 align:middle line:84%
or tornadoes or flooding,
some sort of catastrophe,

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
hedging against a cooler
summer or a warmer winter.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say I was insuring
a product for $5 million

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.880 align:middle line:90%
no matter what it was.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's say if I was utility
company, a farmer, whatever

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:90%
it was.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I had $5
million worth of crop.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.821 align:middle line:84%
But I could do derivatives that
are worth double that amount,

00:28:55.821 --> 00:28:58.995 align:middle line:84%
and I can control
the effects to where

00:28:58.995 --> 00:29:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I collect on the insurance
that's worth $10 million

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.036 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to selling
the crop for $5 million?

00:29:03.036 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I could definitely
profit from that.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:10%
2010, 2011, Southern
Illinois, Missouri--

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:10%
we had a high peak of tornadoes.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And those types of
adverse weather conditions

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.830 align:middle line:84%
definitely raised the price of
commodities as well as drove

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.249 align:middle line:84%
the volatility,
which also raises

00:29:17.249 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:90%
the price of commodities.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.329 align:middle line:84%
You're going to make more
money if a crop fails.

00:29:20.329 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:84%
You're creating insurance
that's over the price of what

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:90%
your crop is worth, let's say.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you can
control the weather,

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.389 align:middle line:84%
you control how
these products grow.

00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you had an insight to
how these products were actually

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.910 align:middle line:84%
seeded and what products
you use to actually grow

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:84%
those items, corn, soybeans,
and you can control that market,

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.630 align:middle line:84%
it's unlimited profit potential
if you can control the weather.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>If you want to send
cold into the Midwest,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:90%
you buy up pipeline capacity.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.400 align:middle line:84%
You buy up options on heating
and cooling degree days.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%
You buy derivatives
off of rainfall.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:84%
There are mechanisms that you
can make hundreds of billions

00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:84%
of dollars annually and defray
a huge chunk of the cost of this

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.180 align:middle line:84%
just on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange,

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.207 align:middle line:84%
playing with derivatives
in the weather market.

00:30:04.207 --> 00:30:05.040 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
pretty much says it.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Nice summary of what
you were saying earlier.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And this begs the question,
the $64,000 question-- or maybe

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:84%
the $64 billion
dollar question--

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.550 align:middle line:84%
how does Monsanto
play into all of this?

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can take your
time on this one.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they must have
a tremendous amount

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.462 align:middle line:84%
to gain, and from
a number of areas.

00:30:26.462 --> 00:30:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, it
was interesting,

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.020 align:middle line:84%
because in "Why in the
World are They Spraying,"

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.400 align:middle line:84%
we interviewed a number
of organic farmers.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And across the board,
around the world,

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:84%
organic farmers are
losing their ability

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.200 align:middle line:90%
to grow natural, organic foods.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:84%
We included two from Maui who
are having a great challenge.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:84%
One farmer had
seen a 60% decline

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.060 align:middle line:84%
in their ability to
grow organic foods.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.190 align:middle line:84%
The other had a 70%
decline in their ability.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But in our research, we
found a couple of things.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.240 align:middle line:90%
And we contacted Barb Peterson.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:84%
She runs a website
called FarmWars.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And we spoke to her
about this issue

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and why the crop
loss was happening.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And she brought to us an issue,
which is called abiotic stress.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And, as a matter of fact, the
USDA predicts by the year 2030,

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:84%
we will see up to a 50%
more increase in crop loss

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:90%
due to abiotic stress.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
what is abiotic stress?

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Abiotic stress is
literally everything

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.040 align:middle line:84%
that the chemtrail
geoengineering programs create.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:90%
It's drought conditions.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.280 align:middle line:84%
It's too much
moisture in the soil.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It's fungal overgrowth,
because geoengineering programs

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:90%
block our sun.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.620 align:middle line:84%
We now have an
overgrowth of fungus.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's heavy
metal contamination.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And these things,
again, are everything

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that chemtrail geoengineering
programs create.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.280 align:middle line:84%
What she alerted us to was a
seed, now, that Monsanto has.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto has a abiotic stress
resistant, genetically modified

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:57.210 align:middle line:84%
seed that will grow
in this condition.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So what this is,
it's something--

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's resistant
to aluminum, essentially.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: It's resistant to
aluminum, the other particles

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.500 align:middle line:10%
that they will spray and the
conditions that they create

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.040 align:middle line:10%
from these damaging programs.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.990 align:middle line:10%
And I had the
revelation in Maui.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:14.510 align:middle line:10%
In losing our
ability to grow food,

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.190 align:middle line:10%
many people on the property
that I stay on actually

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.390 align:middle line:10%
are dependent completely
off of nature.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:84%
They're dependent on natural
food, sunshine, and rain.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And we're losing our ability.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But the revelation was something
that most every religion

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:90%
talks about.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.639 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
the system that

00:32:32.639 --> 00:32:34.180 align:middle line:84%
develops that wants
to be worshipped.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think the people
in Maui that I described,

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.100 align:middle line:84%
they really live
as God had created.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.245 align:middle line:90%
It's a free system.

00:32:42.245 --> 00:32:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a system--

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Paradise, as it were.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Paradise,
and it's natural.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But through the death and
destruction of our ability

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:50.910 align:middle line:84%
to live off of
nature, or some people

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:84%
would call it,
living off of God,

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:84%
they literally come in
and genetically modify.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And that genetic modification
is where the shift of power

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.060 align:middle line:90%
takes place.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And it literally usurps
the authority of nature

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:84%
or the authority of
God, and brings it

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.690 align:middle line:90%
under corporate authority.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I call
the corporate governmental

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.740 align:middle line:84%
conglomerate, which I
call the beast, that

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.700 align:middle line:90%
wants to be the source of life.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So destroying nature,
destroying God's creation,

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
gives them, through
genetic modification,

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:84%
the ability to become
the source of life.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is where this
godlike power that

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
geoengineer David Keith spoke
about a couple years ago,

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.790 align:middle line:90%
is coming from.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's what
he was talking about.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I
think a lot of people

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
who are watching
this video have heard

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of various agendas,
Agenda 21 and others,

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that are speaking
about an elite goal

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:49.330 align:middle line:84%
of reducing the population
of the planet by up to 80%.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're
controlling the weather,

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and you choose where
droughts happen,

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and you choose which
critical crops fail,

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't we be
looking at, long term,

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.925 align:middle line:90%
a large die-off of populations?

00:34:00.925 --> 00:34:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Without question.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're already seeing that,
just due to the heavy metal

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.560 align:middle line:84%
contamination, the
loss of our ozone,

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:84%
and then the
sterilization of our soil.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.139 align:middle line:84%
But if we allow this to
happen, which we will not,

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.100 align:middle line:84%
but if we did allow
this to happen,

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and we give this system complete
control over our food supply,

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.940 align:middle line:84%
they have control
over our populations.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.190 align:middle line:84%
They have control over
everything in the future.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so
important that we address this.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so
important that we discuss this.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, if you
control the weather,

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.344 align:middle line:90%
you control everything.

00:34:32.344 --> 00:34:33.219 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:34.860 align:middle line:84%
What about the
subject-- we didn't

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.139 align:middle line:84%
talk about this in our
previous interview,

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:38.909 align:middle line:90%
the subject of infertility.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:43.454 align:middle line:84%
Isn't heavy metals toxicity
implicated in infertility?

00:34:43.454 --> 00:34:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: It might be.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen any studies,
but certainly there

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.449 align:middle line:84%
have been studies that link
genetically modified foods

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:52.100 align:middle line:90%
into fertility.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of
people-- and I'm also

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:84%
an advocate of
genetically modified foods

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.940 align:middle line:90%
and natural, organic foods.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's very important to me.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.250 align:middle line:84%
But I realize if we don't
address geoengineering,

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.670 align:middle line:90%
there will not be a choice.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:90%
We will not have a choice.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:84%
We will be forced
to address this.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
so important that we

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:84%
address the
geoengineering aspect.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, there
are places we can start.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:84%
We could, I suppose,
avoid everything

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.750 align:middle line:84%
except locally grown,
know-your-grower type

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:90%
of produce.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But right now, that's not
how the system is set up.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not how our
supermarket systems

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.690 align:middle line:84%
are set up where
most people shop.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It's more costly for
people to shop this way.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.191 align:middle line:84%
But, again, it is
a beginning point.

00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
one beyond that,

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.450 align:middle line:84%
which is also taking
responsibility

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:39.390 align:middle line:84%
for growing some
of your own food.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto, as I recall
from your documentary,

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.600 align:middle line:90%
owns 90% of the seed stock.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: I heard 85% to 90%.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 85% to 90%
of the seed stock.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.075 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And
there's no question

00:35:51.075 --> 00:35:54.060 align:middle line:84%
that we're losing our ability
to grow natural, organic foods.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And if these
programs continue, I

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.240 align:middle line:84%
believe that we will
completely lose it.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
will not be a choice.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So today one of the ways
that we can combat this

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.410 align:middle line:90%
is by growing our own food.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
would be short lived

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:84%
until we get these
programs stopped.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it might be.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.083 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'd have to really
go to a lot of thought

00:36:11.083 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:90%
and consideration, pre-planning.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:84%
As we talked about
in the other show,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.550 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at having to grow
things in greenhouses so you

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
don't have the dumping of these
things onto the delicate leaves

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.720 align:middle line:90%
as they're sprouting.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
Bill Gates-- I know

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:30.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be doing a
third documentary on who.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.370 align:middle line:90%
We've done what.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:34.590 align:middle line:90%
And now we're looking at why.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:35.540 align:middle line:90%
But who?

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Bill Gates' name is heavily
implicated in all of this.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I find interesting
is that I remember

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.050 align:middle line:84%
reading a couple of years ago,
that he was heavily vested,

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:84%
along with a few other elites,
in establishing a heritage seed

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.740 align:middle line:90%
bank in the Arctic.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, that's
absolutely correct.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But another connection
that we found,

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Bill Gates is very public
about his investment

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:90%
in geoengineering research.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So who is he
saving these seeds for?

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.497 align:middle line:90%
These heritage seeds.

00:37:03.497 --> 00:37:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, I think it
might be him and his cronies.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing-- so
he invests in geoengineering.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Geoengineering
sterilizes our soil.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But what we found, he
also invested in Monsanto.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So through the death
and destruction,

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.840 align:middle line:84%
he actually profits
on both ends.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.974 align:middle line:84%
And then has his
natural, organic seeds.

00:37:21.974 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A seed bank, yeah.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: On the
other side, yeah.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that's another thing.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.846 align:middle line:84%
If we are going to
grow our own gardens,

00:37:26.846 --> 00:37:30.490 align:middle line:84%
we need to start looking at
finding heritage seeds, right?

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I couldn't
agree with that more.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
are a lot of places

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.725 align:middle line:84%
you can buy them if you
want to go to that trouble.

00:37:35.725 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, if you
do go to that trouble,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.756 align:middle line:84%
it encourages the growth of
that industry, which is growing.

00:37:41.756 --> 00:37:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
a wonderful place

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.710 align:middle line:90%
in is it-- not Healdsburg.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:84%
It's in Marin Country in
Petaluma called The Seed Bank.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It's an old Bank of America
or Wells Fargo Bank,

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:54.600 align:middle line:84%
big, beautiful
building on the corner.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Old stone thing at the
turn of the last century.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And in the gold letters,
it says Seed Bank.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can go there and buy
every kind of heritage seed

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.590 align:middle line:84%
imaginable, which is
where I buy a lot of them.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Also, anything having to do with
Steiner or the Waldorf school

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:10.150 align:middle line:84%
system and they have
their little shops.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And they have their
anthroposophical gardens.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And they sell seeds.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are many really kind
of a well-established heritage

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.247 align:middle line:84%
seed sellers out
there, aren't there?

00:38:20.247 --> 00:38:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: There are.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just for Bill
Gates to hide his away.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We can start taking
some action there, too.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:31.840 align:middle line:84%
You have a section in the
documentary on Monsanto

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.841 align:middle line:90%
and on this whole topic.

00:38:32.841 --> 00:38:34.423 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind if we
take a look at that,

00:38:34.423 --> 00:38:35.770 align:middle line:90%
just take a couple minutes?

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Absolutely.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.288 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK Let's
go to that clip.

00:38:37.288 --> 00:38:46.470 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>The nature of the risk and our
ability to respond to the risk

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:54.280 align:middle line:84%
is much greater in the
case of the scenario that

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.880 align:middle line:84%
might involve large-scale,
regional agricultural

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.210 align:middle line:84%
disruption lasting
a number of years.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>So the agenda was dropped.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.620 align:middle line:84%
The agenda was to kill
the storm, at least

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.000 align:middle line:90%
in that one particular spot.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>You'd see a tremendous
and significant loss

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.720 align:middle line:90%
of property and crop production.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Many times this will cause
farms to go out of business.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.327 align:middle line:84%
And when farmers
go out of business,

00:39:19.327 --> 00:39:20.410 align:middle line:90%
they usually have to sell.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And then if there's somebody
waiting in the wings

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
to buy their land, and
then turn that land over

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.620 align:middle line:84%
to the production of
genetically modified crops,

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.450 align:middle line:84%
you could see where
there would be

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.200 align:middle line:84%
kind of a strategic
advantage there.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>There's something that
happened in the Midwest.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.951 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure everybody's
heard about the flooding

00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:38.670 align:middle line:90%
in the Midwest.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.320 align:middle line:10%
And what happened
is George Soros

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:10%
and his big corporate
monolith went in

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.260 align:middle line:10%
and started buying
up the farmland.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:10%
So not only is it
creating all the stresses,

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.960 align:middle line:10%
it appears to be a
corporate land grab.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when the
farmers, the small farmers,

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.486 align:middle line:84%
go out of business--
they're wiped out

00:40:02.486 --> 00:40:04.110 align:middle line:84%
through these droughts
and everything--

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.290 align:middle line:84%
then the big guys come
in and buy up the land.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.520 align:middle line:10%
>>And if you think
of Western history,

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of it concerning
water rights and even

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:10%
water wars.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
shooting about access

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.280 align:middle line:84%
to water to water
your livestock.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And now people are thinking,
or at least the people

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.160 align:middle line:84%
who are involved
in weather control

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.600 align:middle line:84%
sometimes think about the river
of moisture above our heads,

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and jeez, if we
could just tap that.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:90%
But that, too, is a water right.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:39.160 align:middle line:84%
That would involve
access to the people that

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.667 align:middle line:84%
felt like maybe they had
prior rights over it.

00:40:41.667 --> 00:40:42.500 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:43.360 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.776 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to talk about some

00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:46.840 align:middle line:84%
of the acknowledged
geoengineering

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
by other governments
in the world.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.772 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to
talk about that.

00:40:50.772 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:84%
In a moment we're going
to talk about activism.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Which countries are actually
making some inroads?

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I know you talked in
our first conversation

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.740 align:middle line:90%
about what you're doing in Maui.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But we'll broaden
it out a little bit.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on elsewhere
in the field of geoengineering?

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well,
geoengineers now are

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.860 align:middle line:84%
doing something which is
called iron fertilization.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So they're dumping
certain chemicals, iron,

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:16.350 align:middle line:84%
into our oceans to
literally change

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.420 align:middle line:90%
the composition of our ocean.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The stated goal of that is that
it will create algae blooms

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and literally remove
CO2 from our oceans.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:27.520 align:middle line:90%
We haven't studied much on that.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.580 align:middle line:84%
But again, this is
genetic modification.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a change of our
natural environment.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So geoengineering
is actually defined

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:84%
as the artificial modification
of the Earth's climate.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So we have a group of
scientists, corporations,

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and governments
that want to change

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:47.340 align:middle line:90%
the content of our environment.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Now this has catastrophic,
obviously, consequences.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:54.350 align:middle line:84%
It's people literally
playing God.

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are
there any countries

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.680 align:middle line:84%
that have been more
forthcoming about this issue

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.185 align:middle line:84%
since the spraying is
happening all over the world?

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's almost no
where I go on the planet,

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:05.205 align:middle line:84%
and I travel a
fair amount, where

00:42:05.205 --> 00:42:07.929 align:middle line:90%
I don't see you chemtrails.

00:42:07.929 --> 00:42:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well,
what's happening now,

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.620 align:middle line:84%
again, the official story is
that these programs have not

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.530 align:middle line:90%
been implemented.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.530 align:middle line:84%
That they're just in
the developmental stage.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:16.196 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:16.196 --> 00:42:17.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the PR side of it.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the reality.

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:84%
We know they've been
spraying for at least a dozen

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.800 align:middle line:84%
years, maybe more--
probably more.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: No
country has admitted

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that these programs
have started.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.570 align:middle line:84%
However, geoengineers
now are advocating

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:29.840 align:middle line:84%
emergency war-time
scale geoengineering.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.680 align:middle line:84%
What they're sourcing is
the methane release, which

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.200 align:middle line:84%
appears to be happening, which
appears to be triggered--

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go back
and say that again.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.065 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Geoengineers now--

00:42:40.065 --> 00:42:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.180 align:middle line:90%
What is it that--?

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.555 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: --and
scientific groups

00:42:42.555 --> 00:42:45.710 align:middle line:84%
are calling for emergency
war-time scale geoengineering.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're referencing
the methane release

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that appears to be
happening and also

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.490 align:middle line:84%
appears to be triggered
by geoengineering.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
this ice melt-off

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.660 align:middle line:90%
and the warming of our oceans.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Because geoengineering
traps our heat.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.990 align:middle line:84%
We have more ice,
which is melting.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we
have more methane

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.130 align:middle line:90%
being released into our sky.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And methane is very much
of a greenhouse gas.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So it appears to be a
runaway train type scenario.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can't get any
real, definitive answers

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:84%
on what the planet
should be or would

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:21.055 align:middle line:84%
be at until the global
spraying discontinues.

00:43:21.055 --> 00:43:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And once it does, I believe
that our fragile planet

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:25.790 align:middle line:90%
will eventually heal itself.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And Dane Wigington-- I
was just talking to him,

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and of course they have
a forest that's dying.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.980 align:middle line:84%
They have grass
that is not growing.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.930 align:middle line:84%
A couple of storms
came in a few years

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:38.890 align:middle line:90%
back, which they did not spray.

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And quickly, the forest
started rebounding.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:43.690 align:middle line:90%
So nature is very resilient.

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And once these
programs are stopped,

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
which we will get
them stopped, we

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.240 align:middle line:84%
will have a restoration
of our planet.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Geoengineers state that
once these programs start,

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.350 align:middle line:84%
it will be next to
impossible to stop them.

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Because what they
have done, they've

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:84%
disturbed our
circulatory pattern.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:84%
They've literally
offset the Earth.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Mother Earth is out of balance.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we will
have some challenging times.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.000 align:middle line:90%
We will have immense storms.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.610 align:middle line:84%
We will have scenarios
that are unpleasant.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's the only way
to bring our fragile Earth back

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.130 align:middle line:90%
to restoration.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were saying that
they're looking at an increased

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:27.050 align:middle line:84%
level of spraying for
this wartime strategy?

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well,
what they're saying

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.614 align:middle line:84%
is they're denying that the
programs have been started.

00:44:31.614 --> 00:44:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.120 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying
they want to start

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.464 align:middle line:90%
with this full-scale assault.

00:44:36.464 --> 00:44:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Immediately.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does that mean
that they would actually

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.780 align:middle line:84%
be increasing their efforts
over what they've already done?

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Or just finally saying, Yeah.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you do see
something going on,

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.120 align:middle line:84%
which of course would
lead to the question,

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.890 align:middle line:84%
well, what was that before
that we saw going on?

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: What was that before.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And the official story
is that what we're seeing

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:53.530 align:middle line:90%
is condensation trails.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.730 align:middle line:84%
However, all of the
documentation around the world

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:57.110 align:middle line:90%
contradicts what we're seeing.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Literally every consequence
of geoengineering,

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:06.110 align:middle line:84%
including the weather patterns,
the disruption of our ozone

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:08.250 align:middle line:84%
layer, the pH changes
of our soil-- I

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:09.469 align:middle line:90%
could go on and on and on.

00:45:09.469 --> 00:45:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Those things are all happening.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:84%
However, what they're
doing, they're

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.510 align:middle line:84%
selling this to the
public now because--

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is the
PR release to say now

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.500 align:middle line:84%
things have gone out
of balance because

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.750 align:middle line:84%
of Mother Nature and
her global warming.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And as human beings, our hair
sprays and refrigerant coolants

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and all of that have
screwed up the environment.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So they need to
intercede on our behalf

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.055 align:middle line:90%
with this wonderful program.

00:45:32.055 --> 00:45:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Is that how it's
going to play out?

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: On our behalf.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.494 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing,
because they're

00:45:35.494 --> 00:45:37.490 align:middle line:84%
selling this stating
these programs are

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:90%
going to hurt some people.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.960 align:middle line:84%
It could disrupt the food
supply of over 2 billion people.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking
about dealing

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.470 align:middle line:90%
with the issue of equity.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:48.100 align:middle line:84%
There are going to be
winners and losers, according

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:48.790 align:middle line:90%
to Ken Caldeira.

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:54.930 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the major and
most worldwide recognized

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:56.800 align:middle line:84%
geoengineers talking
about how to deal

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.770 align:middle line:90%
with these legal issues.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.110 align:middle line:84%
They are talking, again,
about programs stating

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.820 align:middle line:84%
that if they implement
these programs,

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.200 align:middle line:84%
it will create droughts
in Africa and Asia.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Guess what we have?

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.780 align:middle line:84%
We now have droughts
in Africa and Asia.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.760 align:middle line:84%
This is not about
cooling the planet.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:84%
This is not about
protecting humanity.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.240 align:middle line:84%
These programs are
the most effective way

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:20.090 align:middle line:84%
to consolidate monetary
and political power

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.450 align:middle line:84%
into the hands of a
few at the expense,

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:25.980 align:middle line:84%
literally, of every living
thing on the planet.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So we must be wise
when dealing with this

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and really comprehend
this is not about us.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need to
comprehend the depth

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and seriousness of the issue.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.420 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a trifle
that's going to go away.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.252 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to be-- I don't

00:46:39.252 --> 00:46:40.460 align:middle line:90%
know what it's going to take.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what it might take.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.350 align:middle line:90%
I know what you've done in Maui.

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.480 align:middle line:84%
First of all, are
there any geoengineers

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.670 align:middle line:84%
who have come out as
whistleblowers on this?

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Not yet.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
reasons for making the film.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.360 align:middle line:84%
There are good people
in our military.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.952 align:middle line:84%
There are decent people
involved in these programs.

00:46:58.952 --> 00:47:00.160 align:middle line:90%
There are a couple of levels.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.910 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
know what's going on.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And people who are carrying out
these programs probably being

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.386 align:middle line:84%
told that it's top
secret because the public

00:47:08.386 --> 00:47:09.760 align:middle line:84%
would not be able
to handle this.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that a
number of those people

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.210 align:middle line:84%
generally have a good
nature within them.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
reasons, to waken people up,

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that this is not about
protecting the planet.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:20.160 align:middle line:90%
This is about money.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.120 align:middle line:90%
It's about power.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.740 align:middle line:84%
It's about the end of
natural life on the planet

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.960 align:middle line:84%
so that this governmental
corporate conglomerate

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.050 align:middle line:90%
can be the source of life.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And once they find that out,
we're expecting a lot of people

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to actually step forward,
come out, walk away

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.620 align:middle line:84%
from these programs, and join
us in moving forward and getting

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:90%
this out into the open.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought
for the last 12 years,

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.650 align:middle line:84%
so what's it going to take
before somebody acknowledges

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:46.120 align:middle line:90%
this, someone in high places?

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.090 align:middle line:90%
And it has not happened yet.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:50.825 align:middle line:84%
So that means it's
up to us, as usual,

00:47:50.825 --> 00:47:52.200 align:middle line:84%
if any change is
going to happen.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.330 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people on this planet.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:56.760 align:middle line:84%
It we're educated and
know what we can do-- now

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.550 align:middle line:90%
you've taken political action.

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Awareness is huge now in Maui.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So you're now-- you have your
local city fathers and mothers

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.440 align:middle line:90%
on board to help you with this.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.100 align:middle line:84%
What are you seeing
elsewhere in the world?

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.922 align:middle line:90%
And what else can we do?

00:48:10.922 --> 00:48:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, we're seeing
more at the local level.

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at our members
of Congress and the Senate,

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:20.310 align:middle line:84%
they were put into office
because they support

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:23.250 align:middle line:84%
powerful interest and
the corporate interest,

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:27.712 align:middle line:84%
the very interest that profit
from these damaging programs.

00:48:27.712 --> 00:48:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
one of the questions

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.920 align:middle line:84%
that's often asked, why is the
mainstream media not covering

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.419 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:48:32.419 --> 00:48:33.520 align:middle line:90%
First of all, they are.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But they're leaking
this as something

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.050 align:middle line:84%
that will cause a lot of
damage they don't want to do,

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.180 align:middle line:84%
but they may have to
do to save the planet.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:45.620 align:middle line:84%
If you look at any nightly
news, all of our advertisers

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:46.550 align:middle line:90%
are Monsanto.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:47.260 align:middle line:90%
It's Raytheon.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the very companies
that profit from this.

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So that puts the
responsibility into our hands.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time, we literally

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.770 align:middle line:84%
have an issue that affects
each and every one of us.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we need to put
the pressure on any and all

00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:59.849 align:middle line:84%
from local on up
of our legislators?

00:48:59.849 --> 00:49:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, I think
that's one of the things.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But because of
the unawareness, I

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.140 align:middle line:84%
think it's our responsibility
to connect with our neighbors,

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.710 align:middle line:90%
to bring in DVDs.

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:10.924 align:middle line:84%
We encourage anybody
who purchases a DVD

00:49:10.924 --> 00:49:12.465 align:middle line:84%
to make copies and
hand out for free.

00:49:12.465 --> 00:49:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
the first reaction

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.000 align:middle line:84%
is going to be to grow
your own garden, right?

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.333 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one of the
first things that will happen.

00:49:17.333 --> 00:49:19.330 align:middle line:84%
As a neighborhood
collective, you watch this,

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.180 align:middle line:84%
you want to take responsibility
for not poisoning yourself

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.055 align:middle line:90%
further, right?

00:49:23.055 --> 00:49:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Absolutely.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:25.270 align:middle line:90%
And just getting the word out.

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I can guarantee,
once we have critical mass,

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and collectively we
stand up, these programs

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:32.090 align:middle line:90%
will not continue.

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Many people look
at this in fear.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And I really urge people to look
at this is as an opportunity.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.690 align:middle line:84%
For the first time,
we have this system

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:42.310 align:middle line:84%
that's been in development for
hundreds, if not thousands,

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:43.080 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.400 align:middle line:90%
And we have a crisis.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.390 align:middle line:84%
It literally is the
future of our children.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It's the future of humanity.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.580 align:middle line:84%
We have an opportunity
to stand up,

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.830 align:middle line:84%
to correct, and to
protect Mother Earth

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and to restore our
fragile planet that

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:57.490 align:middle line:84%
has been molested
in so many ways.

00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:58.526 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, no one
is going to accuse you

00:49:58.526 --> 00:50:00.109 align:middle line:84%
of not doing your
part, and the people

00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:02.130 align:middle line:84%
working with you, and
thousands of other people

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:03.046 align:middle line:90%
who have been on this.

00:50:03.046 --> 00:50:04.907 align:middle line:84%
There are websites all
over the place on it.

00:50:04.907 --> 00:50:06.990 align:middle line:84%
If you want to look at the
physical effects of it,

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.850 align:middle line:84%
as you said, Clifford Carnicom
has done some great work.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful video
with Sofia Smallstorm

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.530 align:middle line:84%
on one of the
effects of it that's

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:16.690 align:middle line:90%
pretty difficult to watch.

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's worth looking at
if you really want to know.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have only a
minute or two left now.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.372 align:middle line:84%
And you have a third one
coming up, "Who in the World?"

00:50:25.372 --> 00:50:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: It's the question
that's being asked.

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:28.747 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to investigate.

00:50:28.747 --> 00:50:29.830 align:middle line:90%
We're going to name names.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to connect dots
in terms of who specifically,

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:35.540 align:middle line:84%
not only corporations,
but individuals

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.190 align:middle line:84%
are involved with
these programs.

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to
take a lot of work.

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:39.830 align:middle line:90%
But we have to do it.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:41.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to hold these
people accountable.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the next
important step, not only

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.640 align:middle line:84%
in creating awareness,
but moving closer

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.160 align:middle line:84%
to getting these programs
stopped, which we will.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know you haven't
completed your research yet,

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:57.200 align:middle line:84%
but would it be a
fair guess to say

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that some of the people involved
are some of the same families

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and individuals
that are involved

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:06.960 align:middle line:84%
at the top of other crises, such
as banking crises and so forth?

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Oh, there's
absolutely a connection

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:10.650 align:middle line:90%
that we've seen so far.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So it probably won't
be a surprise to many.

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's going
to be groundbreaking

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:17.690 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what we
will come up with.

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:20.207 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any surprises so
far as just a little tease?

00:51:20.207 --> 00:51:21.290 align:middle line:90%
We've heard of Bill Gates.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.530 align:middle line:90%
We've heard of Raytheon.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:24.196 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
just finger pointing.

00:51:24.196 --> 00:51:26.127 align:middle line:84%
It's like if we can have
any hint in advance,

00:51:26.127 --> 00:51:28.460 align:middle line:84%
because when is this film
going to be done and released?

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I'm not going
to commit to that.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.101 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:30.101 --> 00:51:31.265 align:middle line:90%
It's still a little while.

00:51:31.265 --> 00:51:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yeah.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we can do to help
ourselves and educate ourselves

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.400 align:middle line:84%
in the interim, if there's
any other corporation maybe

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.300 align:middle line:84%
we need to be aware
of, let us know.

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.445 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: We're going to let you
know when that info comes out.

00:51:41.445 --> 00:51:41.995 align:middle line:90%
We're going to put it out.

00:51:41.995 --> 00:51:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll
have you back here

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and we'll continue on
this journey together.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.849 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much for your
time and for your dedication.

00:51:48.849 --> 00:51:49.390 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:51.723 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there is a more
important topic out there.

>>MURPHY: Thank you so
much for covering this.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.879 align:middle line:84%
God bless and keep on
spreading the truth.

00:51:56.879 --> 00:51:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I really
appreciate it.

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:00.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can take a look
at this subject for yourself

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.820 align:middle line:10%
by watching both of these
videos, which you can find

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.930 align:middle line:10%
on YouTube and at
 whyintheworldaretheyspraying.com.

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:08.630 align:middle line:10%
There are many sites
out there devoted

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:10.030 align:middle line:10%
to chemtrail tracking as well.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.590 align:middle line:10%
But most of all, we need
to protect our bodies,

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.850 align:middle line:10%
as we discussed in our
first conversation, which

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:10%
you can watch here on Gaiam.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And also do what we can
to stop this practice

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.930 align:middle line:84%
by putting pressure
on our legislators.

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
