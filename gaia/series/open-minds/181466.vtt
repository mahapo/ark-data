>>REGINA MEREDITH: We're
all familiar with the terms

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:10%
meme and zeitgeist.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:10%
But how many of you
have heard of egregores?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Mark Stavish is here today
to share his research

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:84%
on the effect of
collective belief

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and its extension called
egregores, virtual beings that

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
can influence, even control
our collective experience

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:90%
and individual choices.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.857 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Mark, what
a fascinating book.

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK STAVISH: Thank you.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.064 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You know,
and it brings up some,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:10%
I think it really helps clarify
some issues we have about

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:10%
controlling forces because
so many people watching this

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:10%
have come to accept
that we have guides,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:10%
that there are dark entities.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, Hollywood
has done its share

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:90%
of pumping that notion up.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:84%
But the way you handle it is
very intelligent because a lot

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:90%
of it has to do with us.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
what we've personally

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:90%
created within our own minds.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go ahead and
start with a definition.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:90%
What is an egregore?

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've written a whole
bunch of different notions

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
in your book of what is
considered to be an egregore.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Define egregore first.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, an
egregore, it's a Greek word.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:90%
And no one says it properly.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:10%
You're the best.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:10%
You've come closest to anyone.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:10%
I think egregore.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And someone told me--

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wouldn't
have guessed that.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Someone told me
it's like the first g is

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:90%
silent as in gnome.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.939 align:middle line:90%
No, I didn't get it.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: It's potato, potato.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So we just go with
what we've got.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And it really is a
collective consciousness.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And people are familiar
with that term,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.380 align:middle line:84%
particularly from Jungian
studies and psychology.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But we have to ask,
how does it function?

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes an
egregore very important.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So an egregore is really a
social control mechanism.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a limiting factor.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever we're within
a group, there are certain

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
limits as to our thoughts and
actions within that group.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.234 align:middle line:84%
But we often don't
think about it.

00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No we don't.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's influencing us all
the time, whether we know it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.397 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Probably one of
the most disturbing aspects

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
of this book is when people
read it, they suddenly

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
realize how many egregores
or collective awarenesses

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:90%
they're involved with.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And it often brings
with it this sense

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.797 align:middle line:90%
of helplessness or denial.

00:02:29.797 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Like what do you mean
I'm involved with this

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.089 align:middle line:84%
or these things
are influencing me?

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.005 align:middle line:84%
But when you step back
and you think about it,

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
you realize, well,
I'm involved with I

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.400 align:middle line:90%
have an egregore at work.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:90%
We call it a corporate culture.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We have an egregore
maybe in our community.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
We call that
community standards.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
We have an egregore in
our spiritual groups

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual practices
and even with our family.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But these are different types
of collective awarenesses.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, we
voluntarily get involved with,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.854 align:middle line:90%
others just by our geography.

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But what makes
this interesting is

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
that there's two
definitions to an egregore

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:90%
or two descriptions of them.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.030 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the
classical notion.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I like
to focus on with folks.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And the other is
the modern notion.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
The modern notion is
this collective awareness

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:84%
comes together any time
we have a group of people

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
forming a group for a
particular activity.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So that means
some of these egregores

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:90%
can come and go.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the
classical notion,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
which has us down here on
terra firma and some kind

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:84%
of psychic or spiritual
entity on the other end

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and this conduit of energy
that connects the two.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's the classical notion.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think for viewers, one
of the things about egregores

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
that they need to focus
on is their philosophical

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.892 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual and
political egregores

00:03:51.892 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that will
often have the strongest

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:90%
pull on them.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and they
certainly do right now

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.790 align:middle line:84%
in the world at large and
in the US in particular.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.032 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: When we
look at the involvement

00:04:03.032 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that we have in
various groups, one

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:84%
of the things we have
to notice particularly

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:84%
in our spiritual activities
and our political activities

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.764 align:middle line:84%
is that they always
seek to involve us

00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
into identification
with something

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:90%
bigger than ourselves.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's wonderful because
we want to contribute.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
We want our lives to
have value and meaning.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So we often want to
associate with a movement

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.311 align:middle line:84%
that promises to make
the world a better place.

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But what we notice with
particular spiritual movements

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and political movements
is that the egregore

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
becomes an end in and of
itself in that it essentially

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:90%
abuses our goodwill.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
points of the book

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
is to get people to ask
themselves a question, what

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:90%
is it I want my life to mean?

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to achieve
that goal of meaning?

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I participate in
these group activities,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
am I getting out of
what I was promised?

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we get toward the
last part of this interview,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
we're going to really go into
the essentially self help

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:84%
element of this of how
we break those control

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms over our lives.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But first, I think it's good
to really establish just

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
how deeply they
reach into our lives.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, just
take a look at the news.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, identity politics
is politics today.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.145 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And
it's always if you

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.144 align:middle line:84%
look at how people
are being described,

00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
it's always in terms of
membership in a group

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
as if that is the major
or primary defining

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:90%
characteristics of their being.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, for some people, it may
be, but maybe not for everyone.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
So the more we identify with
just these narrow identifiers

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:90%
is what it is.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a narrowing factor.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.596 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Then we don't think
about things outside of it.

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:40.065 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said it's a
social control mechanism.

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at this
mechanically for a moment.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So we know in the world
of the quantum reality

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that thoughts are things,
that everything is a thought,

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and it forms itself,
a thought form that

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:84%
ultimately creates through time,
intention, care, dedication.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It will sink down into a
physical reality, whether it's

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
someone that's dreamt
of a painting that

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
becomes reality or a show
between the two of us sitting

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So on the thought form
realm, if an egregore,

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
classically
speaking, are thought

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:84%
forms that we have collectively
rendered, so to speak,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
or agreed upon
together, if an egregore

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
is the thought form
that's been reinforced

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:84%
by multiple numbers
of people that

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:84%
takes on a life of
its own, at what point

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
is that density so profound
that it creates an entity?

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Does it just take the
repetition of something

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:90%
through time to create this?

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I want to give people
a visual understanding

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
of how we create these things
that we then become slaves to.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
it's very simple.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.924 align:middle line:90%
We get in love with our ideas.

00:06:48.924 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
We fall in love with our
ideas and our notions

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:90%
and our creations.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a
famous painting out there,

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of course, the artist who falls
in love with his creation.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:90%
So this is OK to some degree.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're
impassioning it.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: We're
impassioning it.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The difference is
when does it move

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
from being something which we
create and enliven into when

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.955 align:middle line:90%
it influences us and dominates?

00:07:09.955 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Its own
independent identity.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: It's own identity.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look at the
notion of the thought form.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
All egregores are
thoughts forms.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But not all thought
forms are egregores.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Because the difference
is if we have an idea,

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.611 align:middle line:84%
I have a goal in my life,
I want to write a book,

00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a show, I want
to run a successful business,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
all of this involves all the
steps which you've discussed,

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.856 align:middle line:90%
which you've outlined.

00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
The difference is we have to
bring other people into that

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:90%
to help make it happen often.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:84%
That is OK, a kind of an
egregore that we start.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that in most
of our day to day experiences,

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:90%
these are not negative.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:90%
These are OK.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
We need them to
get through life.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But when we move into these
often very philosophical

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and profound areas where
things can be very abstract,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:84%
particularly religion,
philosophy, and politics, where

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
people can get so hung up on
an idea that they'll die for it

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:84%
or kill for it,
that's when you know

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
are you really sure
about this idea?

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is where it's
really fueled with emotion.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Emotion,
that's the key.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Because the entities,
and we're going

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it from
the classical view,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
there is a spiritual
entity at the other end

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:84%
of this that may or may not have
your best interests at heart.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Once the entity's been formed
and taken its own identity.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.865 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Well, not so--

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or are you saying
actual other entities

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:90%
in other realms?

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.705 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: There's others,
other entities in other realms.

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That are taking
advantage of the egregore?

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Because in
the classical world,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:84%
the priest craft would
create this conduit

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:90%
to an intelligence.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.744 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: See, the
problem with human beings

00:08:38.744 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:84%
is they're willfully
human centric.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
We often think of the
cosmos only in terms of us.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we think of our pets.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we think of
the animals we eat.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But we really don't give
much thought or consideration

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:84%
to the host of invisible beings
that could exist in the cosmos.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And they may not all have
your best interests at heart,

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
just as not everyone walking
around on terra firma does.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: We talk about
as above, so below.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: But we
often don't really

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:90%
think about what that means.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So the emotion is
the fuel of it all.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you find that your
emotions are running away

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
from you, that you don't
even understand where

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:84%
these feelings are coming from,
and they're so impassioned,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.456 align:middle line:84%
that's when maybe this is the
tail's wagging the dog now.

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
would look at it

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:84%
in a very extreme case, the
famous news footage of Hitler

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
standing in Nuremberg
in the stadium above all

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of these people feeling them
into a frenzy, so to speak?

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Very much so.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.471 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
is an egregore that

00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
has been created among
the people that is now

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
they are now hostage to on a
psychospiritual and emotional

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying that on
the other side of that,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that fuel that's
been created may

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:84%
be being manipulated and
used by another force

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.045 align:middle line:90%
for its own interests.

00:09:56.045 --> 00:09:58.544 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Correct, and that
would be the same with anything

00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:90%
that you see extremism involved.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, communism's another one.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that bad
boy just won't die.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And it's
constantly being reinvented

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.530 align:middle line:90%
as if somehow it's OK.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: You
see the same thing

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of sporting events
when they just break out

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.195 align:middle line:90%
into this kind of hostility.

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no, this is true.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.936 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't think I've
ever been as frightened as when

00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I was at a Texas OU game
sitting in the bleachers

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
with 100,000 people
stomping their feet.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I literally wanted to get out
of there because that thing was

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:90%
dangerous.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:90%
It would take over.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, and
you look at it now

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:90%
and then there are other kinds.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:90%
These are easy to see.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
why we're talking about

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:90%
because they are extreme.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.945 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And that's really
important to point out.

00:10:35.945 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
The examples I give in the
book, the examples we're

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:84%
talking about here, we're
using very black and white ones

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:84%
so that we can begin
to set a framework up

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.995 align:middle line:84%
for internal reflection
on our relationships.

00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: But they can often
be more subtle or insidious.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So we get a picture of the
really dense gross ones.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into
some definitions

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:84%
that different people,
different ways in which this

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.909 align:middle line:90%
was described in your book.

00:10:57.909 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Should I just pop through a few
and then you comment on them?

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Whatever you want.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Psyche and physical embodiment
of ideologies and systems.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
That seems self
explanatory, right?

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Energy complex as
living beings that must be fed

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and nurtured.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Now that part we need to
get into a little bit.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
further into it later.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Fed and nurtured?

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.294 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
for your viewers,

00:11:19.294 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
most of them are involved,
if not all of them,

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of
spiritual practice.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Often, these spiritual
practices can

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
involve some kind of ideation,
idealizing, I should say,

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:36.360 align:middle line:84%
idealizing of a person or of an
entity, a god form of some kind

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:90%
or deity.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
We see this throughout Hinduism,
Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
We see this in the
classical mythologies.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And there is a form of
worship or devotion.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Devotion is the key.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.746 align:middle line:84%
We're all constantly told
devotion, devotion, devotion,

00:11:50.746 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:84%
even to the teacher,
devotion to the teacher.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:90%
And what is devotion?

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But it is a heartfelt
opening or receptivity

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
to what they have to offer
you, but it's emotional.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It is not intellectual.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It is not analytical.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're often
told, don't analyze this.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.355 align:middle line:90%
Don't think about this.

00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes, it even
goes so far as to say,

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:84%
don't even criticize it,
well, maybe not at the time.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, maybe
some will encourage

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.696 align:middle line:90%
you to think about it.

00:12:19.696 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's that emotionalism
that is the hook because it

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:90%
can feel so wonderful.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who's been to a
revival meeting or some kind

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
of even in an NA or AA
meeting where people

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
are telling their
heartfelt stories,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.854 align:middle line:90%
you can just feel that emotion.

00:12:37.854 --> 00:12:39.270 align:middle line:84%
How many times
have people watched

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:90%
a movie and they begin to cry?

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right/

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: How many
people watched a movie

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and they begin to feel sorrow
or sadness or happiness and joy?

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
We're far more easily
emotionally manipulated

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.474 align:middle line:90%
than we tend to believe.

00:12:51.474 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
how it's feeding us.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Now how are those emotions
then feeding and pumping up

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:90%
the strength of the egregore?

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.464 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: It's a relationship.

00:12:59.464 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a two way street.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
self-feeding loop.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's a
self-feeding loop.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Now the thing
is they often have to grow.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why you see the
idealism is the emphasis.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:90%
We're going to save the world.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.176 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make the
better world a better place.

00:13:10.176 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to turn
it into utopia.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:84%
But that means what
do we have to do?

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:90%
We got to spread the word.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
We've got to
recruit more people.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.357 align:middle line:84%
We've got to absorb more
people into the movement.

00:13:21.357 --> 00:13:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, more
emotion, more energy.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: More emotion,
more energy, more feeding.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
again, the X factor

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.335 align:middle line:84%
is you don't know what's on
the other side of the egregore.

00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: You don't.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
have to ask yourself

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:90%
the question again and again.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll say it throughout
the interview.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Am I getting out of this
what I was promised?

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, another one here.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Is group consciousness
formed by serious initiates?

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Now you touched on this
a little while ago,

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:84%
where you have initiates
of various faiths, which

00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
intentionally come together
to create this commonly

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
held belief or this
egregore to reach

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.440 align:middle line:90%
into other realms of entities.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.415 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that a little bit.

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, again, as we
saw in the classical period

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.340 align:middle line:84%
where the priesthood
would intentionally

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
create these rituals and
actions and forms of worship

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:84%
to make contact
and communication

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:84%
with the invisible realms,
we see the same thing

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
going on today in a variety
of organizations and movements

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.020 align:middle line:90%
intentionally.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are actively
involved in religion or cultism

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:90%
or metaphysics.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, these can be
with very good intentions,

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.005 align:middle line:84%
and at times, can have
very good results.

00:14:35.005 --> 00:14:37.067 align:middle line:90%
I want to be clear on that.

00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But because these
are living entities,

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:90%
they have a life cycle.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And just as people
and organizations

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:84%
have a beginning, a middle, a
decline, and possibly an end,

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
so can these psychic
entities, these egregores.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And when they go toxic, when
they're not getting fed,

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
or when they're in
the state of decay,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:84%
that's when they become
the most dangerous to us

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
spiritually because that's
when people become dogmatic.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.915 align:middle line:84%
They become extremely
dogmatic on the view.

00:15:04.915 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Entrenched.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.335 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Entrenched, yes.

00:15:08.335 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that because
people are no longer working

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:90%
from experience.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They're working from,
we'll say, the written word

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.567 align:middle line:84%
or what they were told, but
not from personal experience.

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now this is
creating a divisiveness--

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --whenever
there is that dogmatism.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.983 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Because your
spirituality should always

00:15:24.983 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
ultimately be about your
individual experience

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and how you can come to
understand that clearly

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and precisely and
usefully in your life.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
when they go super toxic.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
groups that are more

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
oriented toward the dark
side, blood sacrifice,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:90%
so on and so forth.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Throughout history,
it's been very common.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It still happens today.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So what did you learn
in your research

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:84%
when the intention
is dark to begin with

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and you create a very,
very dark egregore,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and then what can happen
on the other side of it?

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, nothing
good comes of this.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:02.993 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I mean,
this is the problem

00:16:02.993 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and because the beginning is
always very selfish, always.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.844 align:middle line:90%
It's always just about me.

00:16:07.844 --> 00:16:09.593 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're involved
with other people,

00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, it's
really you're just

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
involved with it because of
what you hope to get out of it.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Power, usually power.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's
almost always power.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And the toxicity of
power, the power complex,

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:84%
which is an article that was
recently posted on my blog

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.779 align:middle line:84%
by a guest author who is
a Jungian psychoanalyst,

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
really talks about
that is that power

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.861 align:middle line:84%
complex we see in
all of these groups

00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
both supposedly geared towards
the light and those not.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you're involved in
the life force, of course,

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:84%
as we hear it's
getting near Halloween,

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and Dracula always said,
the life is in the blood,

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.770 align:middle line:84%
but that is true because
that is the carrier

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:84%
of the psychic energies,
the prana or the qi.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And when that is
concentrated and released,

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.150 align:middle line:84%
the belief is, among
various esoteric groups,

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that is how you can grab
that, you can manipulate it,

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can direct it to feed
whatever spiritual entity

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.605 align:middle line:90%
you're dedicating it to.

00:16:59.605 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's really very
important because that

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
is the function of the purpose
of these ancient sacrifices

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.390 align:middle line:84%
or even if they
are going on today.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
that it is already

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:84%
started from such a negative
and selfish perspective

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:84%
that the people
involved, ultimately,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
are going to come
to no good end.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Just nothing good
can come from it.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe what
is related to this,

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
though, is when healthy
aggregates go toxic.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.989 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And we talked
about that in the book.

00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
We gave an example, very extreme
example, again, very extreme

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
just so that people
would see worst case

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:84%
scenario, in which
folks were involved

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:90%
in a well-known esoteric order.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
leadership ended up

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:84%
coming down with
the commonalities

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
of blood diseases, all
very rare diseases.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It wasn't, oh,
this one got pneumonia,

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:84%
or this one got
whatever, the flu.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:84%
It's all with the same kind
of strange, peculiar blood

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:90%
disorders.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So one
of the physicians

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
who was involved with the
group talked to me about this

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:90%
and said, these are oddities.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.884 align:middle line:90%
These are outliers, anomalies.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Why so we have so many of them
concentrated in this group?

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.220 align:middle line:90%
What do they all have in common?

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, that
group in particular

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
placed a great deal of emphasis
on the notion of the egregore.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, and the egregore can be
even, for example, Horace,

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Muhammad, all the
masters of influence, right?

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Sure.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.519 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Buddha, right?

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: They are because
you see that happening today.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jacques Valei
said it quite accurately.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:84%
We're involved in the bloody
brutal for celebrity status

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.890 align:middle line:84%
in order to get our message out
there and to be listened to.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you do this,
there's an apotheosis

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that takes place, the
elevation to divine being.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
We see that in the rotunda
of the Capitol building

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.917 align:middle line:84%
where George
Washington is elevated.

00:19:00.917 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, he's
elevated to deity.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: To deity status.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And we see it, I mean, go to
any college campus in September,

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to see posters
of Marilyn Monroe, James

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Dean, Che--

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, come on, it's
been quite a while

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
since these folks
have been alive.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we continue to elevate
them to this status.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Why?

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we see them
as an embodiment

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.100 align:middle line:84%
of the classical
symbolism of Venus.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Marilyn Monroe
was Venus incarnate.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:90%
James Dean, he's the bad boy.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Where does he fit in there?

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:90%
He's not quite--

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's sensitive
and misunderstood.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And he runs afoul of
everybody as a result of it.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So there's a Greek
god that he personifies,

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
important to notice.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:84%
That we as people, and we
talk, as above, so below,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about our charts
and astrology, but each of us

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.315 align:middle line:84%
has aspects of planetary
energies or deities--

00:19:53.315 --> 00:19:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: --that we embody.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: We're very mercurial.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking
and communicating

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:90%
and all of this stuff.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.555 align:middle line:84%
Just so your listeners
can be watching,

00:20:03.555 --> 00:20:06.165 align:middle line:84%
your viewers can begin to
think about it in themselves.

00:20:06.165 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
But then you take someone
like Che Guevara, I mean,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:90%
he was Castro's assassin.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:90%
He was a murderer.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.375 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we sell posters
of him in college campuses

00:20:15.375 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:90%
as if he's a hero.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he's idolized.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:90%
What about corporations?

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.533 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like one
of the biggest egregores

00:20:21.533 --> 00:20:23.207 align:middle line:90%
would be corporate--

00:20:23.207 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Culture?

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Now they call it
corporate culture.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yes, corporate
culture is the biggest one.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, two of them,
corporate culture

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:30.940 align:middle line:90%
and political correctness.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: These are the
two biggest egregores today.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And they intersect through the
priesthood of the department

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:90%
of human resources.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:90%
That's where they come together.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
a corporate culture,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
it is an egregore
that you voluntarily

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:90%
agree to participate in.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because there

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:84%
are have been experimental
corporate cultures,

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and there have been more
democratic corporate cultures

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that do come along
from time to time,

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:84%
where the employees are even
the primary shareholders.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And there you see, and this
I'm getting into for a reason,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
it's just as with
religions and gods.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have it written
down this way,

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
you have certain
corporate egregores

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:90%
where you obey and you worship.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And you have others
where there's

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:90%
appreciation and gratitude.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Same, it's offering
something, but distinctly

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.000 align:middle line:84%
different in its intention,
how it's taken up and received,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and the comfort of the person
on the giving end of it.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so in most
corporations, it's top down.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Mm-hmm.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's worship and obey.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:84%
That's like almost like
lower gods, lower religions,

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And that dominates
most of our planet,

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:84%
not even to get into the
notion of political structures.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But people who are plugged
in through corporate systems

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and then their sheer extension
through mass media, which

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:84%
is the next one we'll get
into, to influence our thinking

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate us into buying
their product and so forth

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:84%
is very much a hierarchical
top down structure

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:90%
the majority of the time.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.110 align:middle line:90%
And we're just used to it.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, to really
look at this carefully,

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:84%
we like to think that
magic has gone away.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
However, Ioan
Couliano in his book,

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.600 align:middle line:84%
"Eros and Magic in
the Renaissance,"

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
described very carefully
the survival of magic

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:84%
particularly through
corporate industrial complexes

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:90%
and government complexes.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And having come from
communist Romania,

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:84%
he was quite aware of the role
of social control mechanisms,

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
media and corporate
combinations to keep people

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.310 align:middle line:84%
thinking and acting
on particular lines.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.845 align:middle line:84%
And his book is really something
that everyone should read.

00:22:53.845 --> 00:22:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
his name again.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.053 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Couliano.

00:22:56.053 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:84%
The book is "Eros and
Magic in the Renaissance."

00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: The University
of Chicago Press.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.781 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And of
course, he focuses mostly

00:23:03.781 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:84%
on the writings
of Giordano Bruno.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And Bruno's book, "On
the Bonds in General,"

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a
boring title, but it

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:84%
was written nine years
before he was executed,

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.670 align:middle line:84%
burned at the stake in
1600 in the center of Rome.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And that book in
particular is probably

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
more important than
Machiavelli's "The Prince,"

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:84%
because "The Prince"
talks about power

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.350 align:middle line:84%
in terms of very conventional
ways of acquiring it.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But Bruno's book talks
about in terms of,

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:90%
what is the role of influence?

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.970 align:middle line:84%
How do we influence
the individual?

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And how do we
influence the masses?

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And how we do that through
symbols and signs and images?

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:84%
The power of the image,
the power of the brand,

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:58.572 align:middle line:84%
the power of the logo, the
power of the slogan or mantra,

00:23:58.572 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
the spell, the enchantment
that takes place

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.700 align:middle line:84%
through constant repetition
and exposure to these things.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Add music
to it, which goes

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
deep into the emotional
aspect of being to boost it

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and the repetition of the slogan
with the music repeatedly,

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
for example, and you have
something hardwired enough

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.141 align:middle line:84%
you'll remember it
on your deathbed.

00:24:20.141 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
I still know all the jingles
from the various products

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:90%
in my childhood.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I was just
going to say that.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
How often have you
found yourself,

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:84%
you're doing your dishes,
you're doing something,

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:90%
and some song's in your--

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:28.580 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.871 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: (SINGING) --good
at dirt and grime and grease

00:24:30.871 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:90%
and just--

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:90%
No, it's true.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we think,
oh, a lot of people

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:84%
say, well, I don't
work for a corporation.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I got out of the corporate
life a long time ago,

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and no more top down with me.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.130 align:middle line:84%
However, we are succumbing to
it with these subtle messagings

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
if we are dialed in
at all to, I think,

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
mass media and the
messaging systems around us.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It takes an incredible
amount of personal definition

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and will to be able to live
beyond these egregoric messages

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.947 align:middle line:90%
coming through to us constantly.

00:25:01.947 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's
increasingly difficult

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and because of the
degree to which we're

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:90%
wired in all the time.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:84%
People really do
need to disconnect

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.587 align:middle line:90%
and be very selective.

00:25:11.587 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't want to
create an echo chamber.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's just
an egregore of itself.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.912 align:middle line:84%
That's another social
control mechanism.

00:25:16.912 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to create an
echo chamber where all you hear

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.930 align:middle line:90%
is what you want to hear.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:84%
But you do have to be
selective and limit

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.280 align:middle line:84%
the amount of
exposure that you have

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.641 align:middle line:84%
to media and particular
types of media

00:25:27.641 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and begin to analyze
the media that you're

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:90%
exposed to more carefully.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Because again, this topic has
two areas of consideration.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.600 align:middle line:84%
One is what we think of
as general mass media

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and mass psychology, and
that's very important.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
There's been a tremendous
amount of information

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.390 align:middle line:84%
written about that even
in the '50s and '60s.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:84%
But then we move
beyond that into

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.930 align:middle line:84%
the psychospiritual aspect,
the metaphysical aspect.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's saying
these things just

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.140 align:middle line:90%
don't end with our brain pans.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.230 align:middle line:84%
They just don't end
with our thoughts.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
We are connected to some kind
of psychic or emotional force

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And we have to know
what that is and if we

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:90%
want that relationship.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.862 align:middle line:84%
And one of the documentaries
I think is it's a terrible.

00:26:09.862 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can
find it on YouTube.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.290 align:middle line:84%
It's very low quality in terms
of the resolution and all.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Even if you buy it
it's, low quality.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's called "Century of
Self," a British film maker.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with Edward
Bernays, the nephew of Freud,

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and now the media started
taking on its role

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and turning into probably
the most powerful

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
of all egregores
in the manipulation

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.150 align:middle line:90%
of mass consciousness.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, it's a very
significant documentary.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And the
reason being is

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.126 align:middle line:84%
that if you just watch the
first few minutes of it--

00:26:41.126 --> 00:26:43.830 align:middle line:84%
when I taught public speaking
at the university level,

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I used to have my
students watch it.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only person in
the communications department

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.145 align:middle line:84%
that actually had
their students watch.

00:26:50.145 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My husband has
his students watch it too.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: About manipulation.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.064 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:26:54.064 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: The bias
I would say about it

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.174 align:middle line:84%
is it focuses only on Western
Europe and the United States

00:26:59.174 --> 00:27:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and ignores the
fact that there is

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:84%
widespread manipulation in
the East Block, which is maybe

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:90%
even cruder and worse.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But that said, if you look
at what Bernays is saying,

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:84%
prior to World
War I, advertising

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.170 align:middle line:84%
had to do with selling
you a product based

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:90%
on its utilitarian value.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, it's based
upon pomp and appeal.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.338 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And then there's
even the manipulation of ideas.

00:27:25.338 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:84%
How does he turn
cigarette smoking--

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.131 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was a brilliant.

00:27:28.131 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: --into the early
women's liberation movement?

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is the
part that really struck

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
me is how for pure profit,
even though it's absolutely

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
against our best interests, it's
going to take our health down,

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.910 align:middle line:84%
create rising cancer rates, I
mean, it's just awful what it's

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:84%
set to do to society, and the
elegant and sexy way they sell

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.540 align:middle line:90%
it to us, so you must engage.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.505 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:55.505 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, that's
the important word is sexy.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's
the critical word.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if we look at the
book I just mentioned,

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
"Eros and Magic," eroticism,
the emotional appeal

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of what we love, what
we're passionate about

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.300 align:middle line:84%
starts first in terms
of human relationships.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So then we take that and
manipulate that and use that.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at all the
things in the news today, OK,

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote something about
this last week sometime,

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a reason why it
all focuses around sex

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.630 align:middle line:90%
because it's unavoidable.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:84%
As much as we may want
to try, it's unavoidable.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So we use that as
the hook because that

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of the
pleasure principle in people.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So we all
want to feel good.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Buddhism says that.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.390 align:middle line:90%
What do we all want?

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:51.440 align:middle line:90%
We all want to be happy.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: OK?

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.360 align:middle line:84%
It talks about the four blisses
as these psychic channels open

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:84%
up and a goodly so-called
kundalini goes through them

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
awakening through--

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:84%
OK the four blisses of
the four main chakras.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we all want to feel good.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So if I can find
out two things, and Bruno talks

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:84%
about this, Tibetan
Buddhism talks about it,

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.520 align:middle line:84%
any manipulator
in the world knows

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:22.450 align:middle line:84%
it, what is it that you want,
and what is it that you fear?

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:84%
If I can find those two things
out, or at least one of them,

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.064 align:middle line:84%
I can hook you, and
I can direct you.

00:29:29.064 --> 00:29:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
only need to look

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:35.480 align:middle line:84%
to pharmaceutical advertisements
to see extreme examples of both

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.380 align:middle line:90%
of those.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.423 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, talk
about an egregore.

00:29:39.423 --> 00:29:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, holy cow.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, you just
touched on Buddha.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
another differentiation

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:50.732 align:middle line:84%
even within the Buddhist world,
the Tibetan tulpa versus tulku.

00:29:50.732 --> 00:29:52.940 align:middle line:10%
>>STAVISH: The reason I used
that example in the book

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:10%
is because many of your
viewers are probably

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:58.130 align:middle line:10%
very familiar with the writings
of Alexandra David-Neel.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.885 align:middle line:10%
And if they're not,
they should be.

00:29:59.885 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:10%
In particular, read
a biography on her.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.330 align:middle line:10%
She's just fantastic.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean, her life
story is just great.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And It ranks up
there with reading

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.440 align:middle line:84%
some of the better biographies
on Madame Blavatsky.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.690 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you say
about her, I don't care.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.787 align:middle line:84%
She's just a phenomenal
story of a person to read.

00:30:13.787 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you talking about
Alexandra or Madame Blavatsky?

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Both of them.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.206 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:30:18.206 --> 00:30:20.882 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a wild character
definitely, hugely conflicted

00:30:20.882 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of areas, but there
are a lot of brilliance.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Alexandra?

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: David-Neel.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.356 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: David, yeah.

00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And she was in
Tibet in the '20s and '30s.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And she helped bring
Tibetan Buddhism to the West

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:10%
And she wrote in her book,
"Magic and Mystery in Tibet,"

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:10%
about the thought form.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.070 align:middle line:10%
This is where we first get this
notion of a thought form taking

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.960 align:middle line:10%
on a life of its own.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.610 align:middle line:10%
She tells this story about how
she visualized this monk, how

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:10%
the monks became tangibly
visible over months of effort

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:52.730 align:middle line:10%
to people around her.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.321 align:middle line:84%
And then it started to
take on an attitude.

00:30:55.321 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And she had to go through
this tremendous effort

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve it because it was
no longer this jolly monk.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.179 align:middle line:90%
It was getting malicious.

00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:04.970 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
have talked about this

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and debated whether
it's real or not.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that matters
because it passes, what I call,

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:90%
the duck test.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Does it walk like a duck?

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Does it act like a duck?

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's a duck.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
thought forms play

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.540 align:middle line:84%
an important role in almost all
Eastern practices and studies.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.920 align:middle line:84%
The notion that thoughts create
a vehicle for spiritual forces

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.170 align:middle line:84%
to come through, that's
the whole focus around much

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.700 align:middle line:90%
of the deity worship.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So we have that notion of the
tulpa, OK, the thought form.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is taken on
its own kind of meme

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:90%
within the internet

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But then we have
the tulku, and that

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
is a reincarnation of
supposedly an enlightened being

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.460 align:middle line:90%
or great teacher.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.990 align:middle line:90%
But they both have their idea.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:52.875 align:middle line:84%
They're both rooted in
the idea of an intention.

00:31:52.875 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I create within my mind the
desire for this to happen,

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.100 align:middle line:90%
and it will.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's not as complex
as people think.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I always remember my grandmother
saying she wanted two things.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:90%
One is to die in her sleep.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And the other is to be a concert
pianist in her next life.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So since she died
in her sleep, I'll

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
assume she'll get
the next one too.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.396 align:middle line:90%
I'm with your grandma.

00:32:14.396 --> 00:32:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a singer
in my next life.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And so that's it, I
mean, if our thoughts are real

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and they are dense enough
through repeated affirmation

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and focus, then what
happens to them?

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go?

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And there you have a
wonderful story of dialogue

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.780 align:middle line:84%
between David-Neel and
Omama and of course, it's

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.340 align:middle line:84%
written in
conventional language,

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:84%
so some people say it
probably didn't happen.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But my guess is she is
repeating the essence

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation, rather
than it word for word.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.220 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, do these
people die simply of fear

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.190 align:middle line:84%
when they do this
certain practice?

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Are the demons
real or is it just

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:90%
their own thoughts take over?

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, when
you go into a jungle,

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:84%
you can believe that
tigers aren't real,

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:90%
but they can still eat you.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:07.292 align:middle line:84%
So there's the tigers
of our own thoughts,

00:33:07.292 --> 00:33:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
the tigers created

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.080 align:middle line:90%
by the thoughts of others.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.746 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
everybody watching

00:33:11.746 --> 00:33:15.380 align:middle line:84%
this understands being
consumed by one's own thoughts.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've all
been at the receiving

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
end of the damage that
has been caused us

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.970 align:middle line:84%
as a result of amplifying
our own thoughts repeatedly

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:90%
in a negative direction.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And now
we're being asked,

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
but even are your
thoughts your own now?

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
people get afraid.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.840 align:middle line:84%
That's where this gets
really scary for them

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.810 align:middle line:84%
because they suddenly
realize that maybe that's not

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:40.610 align:middle line:90%
my goal in life.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.960 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I want.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:90%
This thought isn't mine.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you're living
a life on autopilot,

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.730 align:middle line:84%
the likelihood the thoughts
are even less your own.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: True.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're not
consciously choosing your days,

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.092 align:middle line:84%
choosing your moments,
choosing your engagements.

00:33:55.092 --> 00:33:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
aren't anymore.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you
this, because, I mean,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:90%
I have a very long script here.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I've written a ton of
questions for you, which

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.665 align:middle line:84%
because we're having such
a fascinating discussion,

00:34:04.665 --> 00:34:05.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to get--

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Invite me back.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I will.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going
to get to all of it.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
I was thinking about

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:84%
is for the millennials,
for example,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:84%
which are involved in mass
media as in social media

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:90%
on a constant basis.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So you're really not in a mode
to choose your next moment.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
You're responding to
someone else's intrusion

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.710 align:middle line:84%
on your life via these
devices and such.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So what would a classic
egregore, for example,

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:84%
be of the millennials,
millennials

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:37.370 align:middle line:84%
or all of those that are
addicted to social media

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.912 align:middle line:84%
and on their screen
many hours a day?

00:34:38.912 --> 00:34:41.078 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, one of the
jokes we have is they're

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:43.620 align:middle line:84%
all so hip and individualistic,
they all look alike.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So
really ask yourself,

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.620 align:middle line:84%
is this really your
fashion decisions?

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Are they your own?

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.603 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: What's
the purpose of this?

00:34:52.603 --> 00:34:54.530 align:middle line:84%
What's the statement
you're trying to make?

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
We come on, and we
look at how we're

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.100 align:middle line:90%
going to present ourselves.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.160 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of
crafting an image.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.956 align:middle line:90%
But it has a purpose.

00:35:02.956 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So does what the
millennial go through.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:90%
It has a purpose.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:84%
We think very
carefully about ours.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.720 align:middle line:84%
The question is, are you
thinking carefully about yours?

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I'm asking.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: What is the
image you're presenting?

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And with that, you have
to say, where do you

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:84%
get your ideas
from about how you

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.390 align:middle line:84%
should think and act and eat and
dress and do all these things?

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Are they truly yours?

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Do you truly want them?

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the
images, and they're

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.740 align:middle line:84%
so focused and so
hooked on images,

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.530 align:middle line:84%
particularly through
their phones,

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:84%
that it's increasingly difficult
to get people to disengage.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And what struck me
about this because it's

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:42.350 align:middle line:90%
showing the contrast to it.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I was in a coffee shop recently
and talking to the young girls

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:45.920 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think a pot of
tea, apparently, I

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:84%
had ordered an exotic one,
but literally enough for a cup

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and a half with $6, I said, how
do you guys afford to even have

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.920 align:middle line:90%
drinks in your own shop here?

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.730 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.372 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we're just used

00:36:00.372 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:90%
to not having a lot of money.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But we make money for, we
make space in our budget

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:84%
for being at these
kinds of places.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But we don't ever hope
to own a home or anything

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.480 align:middle line:90%
that you guys have.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.190 align:middle line:90%
They said, but there's a trade.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:84%
We're saddled with
horrible student loans.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.450 align:middle line:84%
We feel like were
slaves to that.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And these two
girls are finishing

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.360 align:middle line:90%
each other's sentences.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:84%
But we have a freedom
that you didn't have.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:84%
We have a freedom to
just accept each other.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And I understood what they were
talking about because of all

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.960 align:middle line:84%
the various agendas
and such that

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:84%
are now more mainstream for
them in their generation.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, how much
freedom do you really have when

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.680 align:middle line:84%
your face is here in response
mode rather than choice

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.990 align:middle line:90%
mode all day?

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And I would even
say the word isn't response.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:90%
It's react.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: React.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.313 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:47.313 --> 00:36:48.264 align:middle line:90%
That's even better.

00:36:48.264 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And I don't
mean to nit pick there.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no, no.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:50.840 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.589 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: But to
respond means that we've

00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:53.970 align:middle line:90%
put some thought into it.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:90%
This is just habituated.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.367 align:middle line:90%
It's habituated.

00:36:56.367 --> 00:36:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I'm saying,
the thing about an egregore

00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.894 align:middle line:90%
is it habituates you.

00:36:59.894 --> 00:37:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, I'm a
little concerned about this.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think there are some
real geniuses in the younger

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:84%
generations, even younger
than the millennials.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:11.180 align:middle line:84%
There are some brilliant people
in all generations out there.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But as a group to have
been raised in this way,

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm really concerned
about what is

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:84%
the egregore that is going to
essentially whip them around

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:22.970 align:middle line:90%
by its tail.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Because as you say,
egregores create

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:84%
a, whether you call
yourself spiritual or not,

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.607 align:middle line:90%
it is a spiritual slavery.

00:37:31.607 --> 00:37:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Well, that's the key.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
real freedom of choices,

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:41.390 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have control over
your life, or at least more

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:46.620 align:middle line:84%
control over your life and the
things that you do, then who

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and what does?

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:51.394 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at, as you say,
the millennial generation--

00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or younger,
way younger, yeah.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: --or younger, I'm not
seeing the ability to choose.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:58.488 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm seeing.

00:37:58.488 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And that because
so much is being automated,

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:84%
there's not even a process,
a reflection process.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
disengage, first of all,

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and you have to make
a plan for your life.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.550 align:middle line:84%
If you just sit back
and accept the fact

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that, well, I'm saddled
by this, and I'm never

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.590 align:middle line:84%
going to own a home, you've
made that choice now.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.250 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not saying it's easy.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:20.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I have a son in college.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I have another one
coming in after.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.300 align:middle line:90%
I know what this is like.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:84%
However, you still have
to then even be sharper

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.010 align:middle line:90%
than the average tack.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:34.057 align:middle line:84%
You have to even step more
out of the collective.

00:38:34.057 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Because what it is is what
we're hearing from them

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.390 align:middle line:84%
is not choice, but
misery loves company.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's what
we're really hearing.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is right.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Misery loves company.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.704 align:middle line:84%
That's not a good meme
under any circumstances.

00:38:46.704 --> 00:38:48.620 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to
know your opinion on that

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:52.760 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about a
whole generation, generations

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.042 align:middle line:84%
of upcoming leaders
in this world.

00:38:55.042 --> 00:38:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
they're not the leaders.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, but they're
going to be of age where--

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: They're
the followers.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're the followers,
and unfortunately, far more so

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.810 align:middle line:84%
than previous generations
that weren't hooked into this.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.590 align:middle line:90%
But this is done by design.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:84%
What is the entity on the
other side of that egregore?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wonder.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, it's
only speculation.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course, it is.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.003 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: But I do
like to point out,

00:39:17.003 --> 00:39:19.290 align:middle line:84%
much to the annoyance
of many people,

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, I remember in
the '80s, the 90s, 2000s,

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.340 align:middle line:84%
we have this fantastic
utopian vision being

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:31.632 align:middle line:84%
fed to us by the New Age
movement and even earlier.

00:39:31.632 --> 00:39:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything is how
perfect it was going to be.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side, we have
the fundamentalist Christians

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:84%
we're getting most parts
saying, digital implants and bar

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:84%
scanners, the mark of
the beast, and one world

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.179 align:middle line:84%
government, and one world
religion, and all this stuff.

00:39:46.179 --> 00:39:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
would be mocked for it.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And then I'd
go down the laundry list

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:84%
with my friends, I'd
say, OK, now which

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.110 align:middle line:84%
one appeared to have a better
idea as to what was going on?

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you got folks in Sweden
now getting subdermal implants

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.810 align:middle line:90%
so that it's to scan things.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.500 align:middle line:84%
That is really what
we're looking at.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.377 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: What we're seeing is
primarily out of Silicon Valley

00:40:05.377 --> 00:40:06.960 align:middle line:84%
is where most of
this is taking place,

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.704 align:middle line:84%
and we have to go
back a few decades.

00:40:08.704 --> 00:40:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is where history
is really important.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.203 align:middle line:84%
I mean, prior to the show, I was
talking to some of your staff

00:40:13.203 --> 00:40:16.670 align:middle line:84%
about research that had gone
on in the '30 between telepathy

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and mass media, particularly
through NBC and Zenith Radio

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Corporation and even
some of the BBC.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:27.580 align:middle line:84%
But what we're seeing in
Silicon Valley, the heart

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.980 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called
progressive politics,

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.260 align:middle line:84%
is the great marriage
of totalitarianism.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes OK

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And that great
marriage of totalitarianism

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.755 align:middle line:84%
is taking place on the corporate
level and the university level.

00:40:38.755 --> 00:40:41.225 align:middle line:84%
And people like to talk about
Eisenhower's final speech

00:40:41.225 --> 00:40:43.600 align:middle line:84%
where he said, beware of the
military industrial complex.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:10%
But they don't actually
read the speech.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.700 align:middle line:10%
Because very specifically, he
mentioned universities as well.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.295 align:middle line:10%
It should have been the military
industrial educational complex.

00:40:52.295 --> 00:40:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes,
educational complex.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Because at that
marriage point in the '60

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and into the '80s
is where we saw

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.630 align:middle line:84%
in parallel offices, the
development of the internet

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and also in technology
computer technology,

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:84%
we know it, but also
psychic research.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.778 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So what
you're seeing is

00:41:12.778 --> 00:41:14.170 align:middle line:90%
the model is being brought up.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The model that is
being promoted,

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and the meme that
is being constructed

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:24.310 align:middle line:84%
is one of a quasi
technological utopia that

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.900 align:middle line:84%
will blend humanity
with technology

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.320 align:middle line:90%
for some form of immortality.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Transhumanism.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Transhumanism.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But it is devoid of any
actual spiritual awakening.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:42.006 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So it
is essentially a--

00:41:42.006 --> 00:41:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
automatons at that point.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, to use the
language of the literature,

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:50.440 align:middle line:84%
it is essentially a
demiurgic satanic entity.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.030 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And as much
as some of the viewers

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:58.120 align:middle line:84%
may object to those terms
on a knee jerk reaction,

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.400 align:middle line:84%
they need to actually look
them up and understand

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.790 align:middle line:90%
what I'm talking about.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.460 align:middle line:90%
These are social constraints.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.530 align:middle line:84%
These are control mechanisms,
as we said earlier,

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:07.330 align:middle line:90%
at their ultimate.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So if we can get you hooked
in and never hooked out,

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.560 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.010 align:middle line:90%
We're done.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:12.400 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:12.970 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Game over.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Except for who?

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:90%
The people at the top.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.320 align:middle line:84%
So I think people are getting
a feeling for this now.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.229 align:middle line:84%
And so because I
want to get into some

00:42:23.229 --> 00:42:25.270 align:middle line:84%
of the ways in which we
can break that influence.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I still have so many
questions to ask you.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:31.360 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that,
are there certain places

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.190 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, kind of
energy centers of Earth,

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:84%
for example, where a collective
thought form can really

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.870 align:middle line:84%
become saturated and take
on a power of its own

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.357 align:middle line:90%
beyond another area?

00:42:42.357 --> 00:42:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because a lot of
times, these sacred sites

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.885 align:middle line:84%
are built onto telluric lines
and so forth for a purpose.

00:42:46.885 --> 00:42:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Most likely.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:48.350 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They're built there
for a purpose.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
what is the thought?

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.365 align:middle line:84%
Most of these places where
it's going to be densest

00:42:54.365 --> 00:42:56.490 align:middle line:84%
is going to be where the
ritual and the meditation,

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:84%
the visualization has taken
place over and over again.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
churches or temples or even

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.360 align:middle line:84%
political places, places that
have been enshrined in history.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you see a certain
repetitive paranormal phenomena

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.400 align:middle line:90%
in some places.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the activity
that took place

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:84%
at this one moment in time
is now enshrined there,

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and it comes back on a psychic
repeating loop, if you will.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.880 align:middle line:90%
So those do exist.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.520 align:middle line:84%
I think for us as individuals,
what we have to look at

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.211 align:middle line:90%
is our own connection into that.

00:43:27.211 --> 00:43:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I say to folks,
one of the best things

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:35.020 align:middle line:84%
to do is take a look at
your spiritual practice

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and try to realize how
much of it is really yours

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and how much of it is
from outside of you.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.139 align:middle line:84%
And there's an easy
way to do that.

00:43:43.139 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:84%
If you belong to a
group, and I don't

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.160 align:middle line:84%
care what it is, take
everything from that group,

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.994 align:middle line:84%
take the pictures off
your walls, the statues

00:43:50.994 --> 00:43:53.410 align:middle line:84%
off your shrine, everything,
and just put it in some boxes

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and put it in your closet for 30
days, maybe a month and a half,

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:84%
two months, and just
put it away and don't

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.420 align:middle line:84%
fill that space with
anything and just

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:84%
notice how different you feel
when you're not constantly

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:11.190 align:middle line:84%
being reinforced by those
images or by the music.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, you have to
get rid of the CDs too.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When it's just you.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Just you.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:20.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to be just you and just
alone with your own thoughts

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.100 align:middle line:90%
and notice.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.422 align:middle line:90%
Then you'll know.

00:44:22.422 --> 00:44:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing,
if you've got friends

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:27.700 align:middle line:84%
who are entrenched in the
various social movements

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.440 align:middle line:84%
or political movements,
and they have

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.810 align:middle line:84%
the posters, and the
buttons, and the bumper

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:35.110 align:middle line:84%
stickers, and all
that, same thing.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of it for two months
and notice the withdrawal.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
you've just issued

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:84%
all of our lovely
viewers a challenge here.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:50.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
I know personally

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:53.920 align:middle line:84%
even when we're talking
about transitory situations,

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and how would this
play in, for example,

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.891 align:middle line:84%
because I have a
similar situation that

00:44:58.891 --> 00:45:01.390 align:middle line:84%
occurred doing research for a
show I was doing on the Donner

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:02.190 align:middle line:90%
party.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Gene Houston's husband,
Robert Masters,

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.160 align:middle line:84%
had an experience
with dark entities

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.490 align:middle line:84%
as he was researching for
some work he was doing

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:11.410 align:middle line:90%
on the subject of witchcraft.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.636 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yes, and that's
really fascinating because--

00:45:14.636 --> 00:45:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These
were his beliefs.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:90%
He was just researching.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:17.425 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah,
he was researching.

00:45:17.425 --> 00:45:19.084 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
entering that world.

00:45:19.084 --> 00:45:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And there's
two stories here.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:25.360 align:middle line:10%
One is with Gustav Davidson's
book, "Dictionary of Angels."

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.010 align:middle line:10%
And same thing had
occurred to him.

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:28.465 align:middle line:10%
He said he was
bedeviled by angels

00:45:28.465 --> 00:45:30.340 align:middle line:10%
as he's writing this
book that suddenly, he's

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.454 align:middle line:10%
having these encounters
and this phenomenon.

00:45:32.454 --> 00:45:34.120 align:middle line:84%
He didn't necessarily
not believe in it.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.578 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't really
believe in it.

00:45:35.578 --> 00:45:36.820 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't his purpose.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But through the
concentrated effort,

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.750 align:middle line:90%
this was happening to him.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And Masters' story was
even more frightening

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:47.890 align:middle line:84%
because his book was, I
think eros and sexuality

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:48.910 align:middle line:90%
and witchcraft.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Again, we're back to eros.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:53.710 align:middle line:90%
And got some time off.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.480 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the late '60s.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.450 align:middle line:84%
He's in the Ozarks
down in Arkansas.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:45:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And he has a cabin.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.920 align:middle line:90%
He suddenly, he realized that--

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not funny, except
for those of us who've seen it.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:10.270 align:middle line:84%
After a while, things
interrupt what you're doing.

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:13.150 align:middle line:84%
He said he had phenomena
around the cabin that

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:14.672 align:middle line:90%
was identical to his research.

00:46:14.672 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the plants are dying.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.742 align:middle line:84%
He's got crows dropping
dead out of the air.

00:46:17.742 --> 00:46:19.450 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't even have
any cattle, but he's

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:21.010 align:middle line:90%
got dead cows in front.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:22.360 align:middle line:90%
The creek's run dry.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.430 align:middle line:84%
His friends come over and say,
Robert, everybody else's place

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:26.230 align:middle line:90%
is fine.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.620 align:middle line:84%
You got dead grass
all around here.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.420 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.960 align:middle line:90%
You got to get out of here.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So he finishes the book
and things return to normal

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.030 align:middle line:90%
and he gets out.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Now your viewers are going to
say, well, but that's not me.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not because you're
not focusing on witchcraft.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But if your are things,
what you need to understand

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:49.800 align:middle line:84%
is that on the psychic
level, they're a flare.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.980 align:middle line:84%
You send up a signal
flare into the invisible.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm here and I'm paying
attention to you.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, how
does the verse go?

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:02.800 align:middle line:84%
When you look into the
abyss, the abyss looks back.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.700 align:middle line:90%
It works both ways.

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.700 align:middle line:84%
When we try to find the
face of God, the face of God

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.570 align:middle line:90%
is there too.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So we want to say there's
positive things there.

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But it just reinforces
in a very dramatic way

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:16.685 align:middle line:84%
the power of our thoughts that
we're completely unaware of.

00:47:16.685 --> 00:47:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I went through a
horrible period when

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I was researching for
I had to do a 10 part

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.790 align:middle line:84%
series on the Donner party at
the sesquicentennial event.

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to read a
number of books on it.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And well, those were like dark
missing period of my life.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.650 align:middle line:90%
It was so awful.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Now crows didn't
fall out of the sky.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anything
horrible happened.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But it did feel as though
there was something

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that had been created
there that had overtaken

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:47.620 align:middle line:90%
my psyche for the duration.

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah, you feel
this kind of oppressiveness.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.138 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And
that's what happens.

00:47:52.138 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Yours was very dramatic
because of the nature

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.090 align:middle line:90%
of the subject matter.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure your viewers are
familiar with what the Donner

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:57.920 align:middle line:90%
party is.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.295 align:middle line:84%
This is a very unfortunate
and horrible piece of history.

00:48:00.295 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it was.

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I still remember
every image, yeah.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.063 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So we have that
we're it's very strong.

00:48:05.063 --> 00:48:07.480 align:middle line:84%
But that oppressive
this can be more subtle.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:11.410 align:middle line:84%
It can be the subtle
annoyance that you

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:18.186 align:middle line:84%
find with that person
who you go for coffee,

00:48:18.186 --> 00:48:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and they look at you
when you put sugar

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:90%
in it instead of honey.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.090 align:middle line:84%
It's that annoying new
ageism that you often

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:27.800 align:middle line:84%
encounter with some people
once they've found the light.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: We all know people,
whether it's they've stopped

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.320 align:middle line:90%
smoking, stopped drinking.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.180 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing worse
than a reformed blank.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.574 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
then it goes into judgment

00:48:39.574 --> 00:48:40.615 align:middle line:90%
and division, separation.

00:48:40.615 --> 00:48:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yes,
that's exactly it.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, yeah.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.480 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.424 align:middle line:90%
So here's another one.

00:48:44.424 --> 00:48:45.340 align:middle line:90%
This is a similar one.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to move on to
the how do we heal this stuff.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.304 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking of Heath
Ledger and what happened

00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:53.470 align:middle line:90%
with the actor Heath Ledger.

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:55.053 align:middle line:10%
>>STAVISH: People
bring that up a lot.

00:48:55.053 --> 00:48:56.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because
of his identity

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:59.200 align:middle line:10%
and because he would
really get into his roles

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.865 align:middle line:10%
with the Joker and
this dark force.

00:49:00.865 --> 00:49:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah,
this is really--

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And dying
right after that.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.118 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah, this is
an important question,

00:49:06.118 --> 00:49:11.046 align:middle line:84%
because within classical
magic, there's something

00:49:11.046 --> 00:49:12.670 align:middle line:84%
that we call assumption
of the god form

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:14.322 align:middle line:84%
where you visualize
a deity, and you

00:49:14.322 --> 00:49:15.780 align:middle line:84%
take on the qualities
of the deity,

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.290 align:middle line:90%
and you become the deity.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:22.840 align:middle line:84%
You see a similar practice
in Indian and Tibetan Tantra

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.962 align:middle line:84%
where you visualize the
deities, and the idea

00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.170 align:middle line:90%
is that you become the deity.

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:27.545 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually,
the idea there is

00:49:27.545 --> 00:49:31.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're actualizing the
qualities that are already

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.860 align:middle line:90%
inherent within yourself.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're both more
or less the same thing.

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:37.420 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that these
qualities exist not only

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:41.140 align:middle line:84%
within you, but they also
exist in others, and therefore,

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.490 align:middle line:90%
out there somewhere.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:43.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you have these
actors who are essentially

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.539 align:middle line:84%
doing assumption
of the god form,

00:49:48.539 --> 00:49:50.080 align:middle line:84%
they're bringing
out these qualities,

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and they're staying in
this role all the time,

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes a force
that has the potential

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.960 align:middle line:90%
to overwhelm them.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And Bruno and, of
course, Cliano points out

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.420 align:middle line:84%
that artists and
actors in particular

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:09.520 align:middle line:84%
are super vulnerable to this
power because of the emotion

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that they use in
the imagination.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: See, all of this
is looked around the power

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.900 align:middle line:90%
of the imagination.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: If I can
hook your imagination,

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:18.040 align:middle line:90%
then the emotions will follow.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And that's
why symbols and images

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:21.160 align:middle line:90%
are so important.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So actors who do this
need to be able to they

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.030 align:middle line:90%
need to be able to disengage.

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:29.470 align:middle line:90%
They need to just get rid of it.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:30.511 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do, right.

00:50:30.511 --> 00:50:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: They just put
it on and play the part

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.334 align:middle line:84%
and know who they
are as a person.

00:50:35.334 --> 00:50:37.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what it all comes down
to, whether you're an actor,

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.194 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're a millennial
involved in social justice

00:50:40.194 --> 00:50:41.110 align:middle line:90%
and getting sucked in.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or an accountant
in a corporation.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Who am I?

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's the
question we're asking.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:51:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And each of us has to be able
to say, I am I. And what we do

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, Moses, and he saw
the burning bush, and he said,

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:05.230 align:middle line:90%
who's that?

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:07.905 align:middle line:84%
The voice comes
back, I am that I am.

00:51:07.905 --> 00:51:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking,
well, that probably

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.280 align:middle line:90%
wasn't very informative.

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is I am that
which is becoming I am.

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I am existence.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.230 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Most of us don't say that.

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:23.500 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we engage
in a kind of self hypnosis

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.680 align:middle line:84%
is we say, I am and then
we fill in the blank.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And notice if you try
that, just relax and say,

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I am, and notice how
quickly your mind

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:33.970 align:middle line:90%
wants to fill the blank.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:35.800 align:middle line:90%
I a dad, right?

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.640 align:middle line:90%
I am a writer.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:37.240 align:middle line:90%
I am--

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.365 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: All these roles.

00:51:38.365 --> 00:51:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --all these
externals, roles, yeah.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.696 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And
that's what happens

00:51:41.696 --> 00:51:44.290 align:middle line:84%
with actors is if you're
playing these parts,

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:45.790 align:middle line:90%
you need to disengage.

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But occultists
and metaphysicians

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual people too,
because the imagination

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:53.710 align:middle line:84%
is so powerful, it's
very easy to begin

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.270 align:middle line:90%
to believe your own propaganda.

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And so now looking at it on the
bright side of, like you said,

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.700 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:04.630 align:middle line:84%
That's one exercise, beginning
to determine what you am,

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:05.730 align:middle line:90%
what you are.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking of
this, an example that's

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.310 align:middle line:90%
really beautiful to me.

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.590 align:middle line:90%
I have this dear friend.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:15.020 align:middle line:84%
He's a pop star out of
England named Craig David.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's just this
amazing human being.

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:22.150 align:middle line:10%
And we met initially because
he watches all my shows,

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.410 align:middle line:10%
which helped him with his
newest album really transform

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:27.440 align:middle line:10%
and up his game even more.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing in his story
that was so beautiful to me

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:32.780 align:middle line:90%
is that he's in England.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:39.580 align:middle line:84%
He's living in Southampton,
council houses, public housing.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.680 align:middle line:90%
And the buddies like to go out.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.490 align:middle line:90%
They want to drink.

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:44.170 align:middle line:84%
At a young age,
the whole thing is

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:47.560 align:middle line:84%
to go out and rouse up a little
bit, get drunk and so forth.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But even at a very early
age, by 16, 17, he was like,

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I want to find my
voice, literally.

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful voice, if you've
not seen him, beautiful.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to find my voice.

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when they'd
go out, he'd say,

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:03.301 align:middle line:84%
man, I think I'm going
to stay in and write

00:53:03.301 --> 00:53:04.360 align:middle line:90%
some lyrics tonight.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he managed
to keep frames,

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.790 align:middle line:84%
but totally differentiated
out into the thing that

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.740 align:middle line:84%
was drawing him more
than anything, which

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.639 align:middle line:84%
was to learn how to
voice his voice, to learn

00:53:15.639 --> 00:53:17.680 align:middle line:84%
how to engage with his
own voice and bring it out

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.610 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of the
strongest people

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I've ever seen in a world
that is just you know.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Talk about egregores of
fame, of power, of fortune,

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and he never succumbed to any
of it and kept his own mind

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and still has his own
mind the entire time.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.600 align:middle line:90%
To me, that was so rare.

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.930 align:middle line:84%
I just fell in love with his
story and his whole person.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:42.204 align:middle line:90%
He's just a sweetie pie.

00:53:42.204 --> 00:53:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
that's a perfect story.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:45.869 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really all
we're asking you to do

00:53:45.869 --> 00:53:48.760 align:middle line:84%
is sit back and
reflect on your life.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Are you doing what
you want to do?

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.360 align:middle line:84%
What are your goals
and aspirations?

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.631 align:middle line:84%
And is what I'm
doing now helping me?

00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I have a son in college.

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I tell him, l said,
life's about choices.

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.900 align:middle line:84%
The key to success
is time management.

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, is what you're doing now
helping you achieve your goal?

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's
not, don't do it.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:08.526 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:08.526 --> 00:54:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: But that--

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:11.536 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: --often
requires that we then

00:54:11.536 --> 00:54:14.839 align:middle line:84%
go against know the
group, the here.

00:54:14.839 --> 00:54:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't like that term,
but you know what I mean.

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: And it can be family.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:22.060 align:middle line:90%
It can be your community.

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.515 align:middle line:84%
It can be the spiritual
group that you've

00:54:24.515 --> 00:54:25.390 align:middle line:90%
gotten involved with.

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:27.806 align:middle line:84%
It can be the political group
that you've gotten involved.

00:54:27.806 --> 00:54:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go to a tent
revival or a fantastic yoga

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:43.370 align:middle line:84%
retreat or even some social
protest, it feels great.

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:48.287 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a hormonal event.

00:54:48.287 --> 00:54:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Adrenaline's move moving and
all this stuff's happening.

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your emotions
are all moving together

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:52.826 align:middle line:90%
in the same direction.

00:54:52.826 --> 00:54:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's right
and you're feeling great.

00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
when it's over, you crash.

00:54:59.180 --> 00:54:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So you want to go
back and you want to get more.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.558 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is what
people don't understand

00:55:04.558 --> 00:55:10.540 align:middle line:84%
is what they're feeling
is a experience that they

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.900 align:middle line:84%
can generate within themselves,
that they can experience

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:17.620 align:middle line:84%
through their own self
realization and then self

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.590 align:middle line:90%
actualization.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part I'm talking
about is the actualization.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Do what you want to do.

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Now if your groups are
helping you, wonderful.

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:34.570 align:middle line:84%
If they're not, leave
them as best you can.

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:36.400 align:middle line:84%
You may not be able
to leave physically.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But you can begin to give
yourself that psychic space.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's like what
Craig David did even as a kid.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Say, hey, I'll catch up
with you later, mates.

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Catch you later.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.850 align:middle line:90%
And still follow your own path.

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:49.358 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
so hard, especially

00:55:49.358 --> 00:55:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I think now for the young
people in reactive mode.

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:53.602 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard to
differentiate out

00:55:53.602 --> 00:55:55.060 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
know how they're

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.520 align:middle line:84%
different a lot of
times any longer.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.769 align:middle line:90%
And this is challenging.

00:55:58.769 --> 00:56:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And in many ways,
it's always been that way.

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.010 align:middle line:84%
We can look back through
history and see those cycles.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing is, and
you hit on it earlier,

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:06.250 align:middle line:90%
is technology.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the
technology, absolutely.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: The
technology is the real--

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:11.860 align:middle line:84%
that is the hook,
the line, and sinker.

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
turning into news speak,

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:16.210 align:middle line:84%
even less differentiation,
even less texture,

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:17.950 align:middle line:90%
less expression in life.

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's down to symbols
and communication by symbols.

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:25.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, another thing you brought up
in the book that's interesting,

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:28.150 align:middle line:84%
it was saying that as
we become, essentially,

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:32.020 align:middle line:84%
more sectarian by
nature as religions,

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:35.410 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world,
especially in Europe,

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:37.690 align:middle line:84%
have really started
dropping away.

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It's left a little bit of a
vacuum on one level, yeah,

00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:45.230 align:middle line:84%
the religions themselves served
as an egregore in our lives.

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So how do you see
this transition

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:51.760 align:middle line:84%
that's occurred away
from classical religions,

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Catholicism in particular
throughout Europe

00:56:53.830 --> 00:57:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and Protestantism to
being freed of that?

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, the problem
is what you do is, first thing,

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to risk the wrath
of your viewers,

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:11.260 align:middle line:84%
the notion of multiculturalism
that you hear in the West

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.390 align:middle line:90%
has never existed.

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:14.360 align:middle line:90%
It is a myth.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It has never existed
historically.

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So what you see is this
notion of multiculturalism

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.650 align:middle line:84%
actually means lowest
common denominator.

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And the lowest
common denominator

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:26.790 align:middle line:90%
then is consumerism.

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, absolutely.

00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So when
we go for this lowest

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:36.594 align:middle line:84%
level of consumerism,
people will seek meaning.

00:57:36.594 --> 00:57:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And that meaning will
take place through

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:43.360 align:middle line:84%
various religious or spiritual
notions or political notions.

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:47.290 align:middle line:84%
The vacuum which is
created will be filled.

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:48.880 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.670 align:middle line:84%
There is an effort now to
fill that vacuum in some ways

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:55.600 align:middle line:84%
with Islam
particularly in Europe.

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm not quite certain what
it's trying to be filled with.

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:04.584 align:middle line:84%
It's an ambiguous spiritual
but not religious notion.

00:58:04.584 --> 00:58:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it seems there
is a rise in fundamentalism

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.291 align:middle line:90%
again though at this time.

00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I'm not
really seeing it.

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
we hear about it.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.160 align:middle line:90%
The media says so.

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.854 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure the numbers
actually bear that out.

00:58:14.854 --> 00:58:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and maybe it's not

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:17.770 align:middle line:84%
fair to say what
used to be called

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:22.060 align:middle line:84%
fundamentalist churches,
the big super churches,

00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.430 align:middle line:84%
don't behave in the
same fundamentalist way.

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.840 align:middle line:84%
It's almost more
as like Joel Osteen

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.130 align:middle line:84%
having to do with a kind of
materialist fundamentalism

00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:37.870 align:middle line:84%
toward making a better life
and gaining wealth and God

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:39.400 align:middle line:90%
shines on you.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.930 align:middle line:84%
When you're wealthy, it's
because God is shining on you.

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So it really is working
its way, religion

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:46.760 align:middle line:84%
working its way into the world
of material and consumption.

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.135 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, that's a
whole interesting piece of work

00:58:49.135 --> 00:58:51.620 align:middle line:84%
there because we can go back
to the new thought movement.

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.919 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's been really
a part of the Protestant ethos

00:58:54.919 --> 00:58:56.131 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:58:56.131 --> 00:58:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's also part of
the New Age movement

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.510 align:middle line:84%
because the notion
of it's your karma.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So we have
to be careful there,

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.450 align:middle line:84%
because if we have karma,
which has cause and effect,

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and I have the ability
do to affect my outcomes,

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:08.480 align:middle line:90%
then it is a way because--

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting
line to walk

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:15.070 align:middle line:84%
because I too believe, yeah, you
manifest what you can manifest.

00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:17.071 align:middle line:84%
That's under your power
to manifest your life.

00:59:17.071 --> 00:59:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with that.

00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Nothing wrong with manifesting
a life of prosperity.

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:24.382 align:middle line:84%
But now it's going
into the big tents.

00:59:24.382 --> 00:59:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And historically,
I think we've seen that.

00:59:26.590 --> 00:59:28.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people just
don't remember it.

00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:31.359 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's like I
mentioned this psychic research

00:59:31.359 --> 00:59:33.184 align:middle line:84%
through media that
was done in the '30s.

00:59:33.184 --> 00:59:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this,
unfortunately, falls

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.360 align:middle line:84%
under the domain of the
specialists to remember it.

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And I think
that's where we're facing

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.170 align:middle line:84%
is as these larger entities
collapse and people become,

00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:45.440 align:middle line:84%
we'll say, excessively
individualistic, see,

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.640 align:middle line:84%
there there's a middle
ground between this.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily it's
just me and me alone,

00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.160 align:middle line:90%
this kind of anti-com--

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.724 align:middle line:84%
or total absorption
in the group.

00:59:53.724 --> 00:59:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We have to have
this middle ground

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.150 align:middle line:84%
where, where do people
healthily interact and help

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.221 align:middle line:90%
each other in a healthy way?

01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're trying
to find our way with now.

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:03.553 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to find that.

01:00:03.553 --> 01:00:05.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's the tricky part.

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And really, it comes
down to strengthening yourself

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.080 align:middle line:90%
on all levels.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And you say this in your book
along with other, as you said,

01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:18.120 align:middle line:90%
know who you are.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Take away all the symbols.

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Take away the other people.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Just sit, I am, and determine
for yourself who you are.

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you say and make all
strong and bring all of you

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.480 align:middle line:90%
into harmony and in strength.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Mind, body, emotions, and
spirituality become strong.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And then as a person,
you're able to give more.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.290 align:middle line:90%
You're able to do more.

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:45.720 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
better than working

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.160 align:middle line:84%
with a group of
true individuals.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Not people
pretending to be--

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.756 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: --but
people who really

01:00:51.756 --> 01:00:54.900 align:middle line:84%
are because they bring
talent and commitment

01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and insight and even
some good argumentation,

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.160 align:middle line:84%
healthy argumentation
to the project.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And then the
project, it moves forward

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.480 align:middle line:90%
and things get done.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be a healthy
and strong individual

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.726 align:middle line:84%
because that's what spirituality
is all about, in the end.

01:01:12.726 --> 01:01:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my husband
Zeus and I really go for

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and trying to join
into new community

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:21.280 align:middle line:84%
is looking for
those individuals.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.894 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, he's a counselor of
adults and young people alike.

01:01:26.894 --> 01:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
he really looks at

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
is with these kids who have
been stuck in this technology

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
mode trying to decide, do I go
to college now, sleepwalking

01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
to the next level without
really making decisions,

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
just because their
parents expect it.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.500 align:middle line:84%
He's really trying to help them
break that egregore and say,

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.300 align:middle line:90%
no.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Where's your genius?

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:47.640 align:middle line:84%
He's a genius at helping
them find their genius

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and start asking a completely
different set of questions

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
coming out of high school before
they even launch into what

01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%
their adult lives are
going to look like,

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
which I love seeing
what happens there.

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But we have to do this
with ourselves too.

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:02.170 align:middle line:90%
We have to take ourselves.

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:04.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to do our due
diligence as parents

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and allow our kids to
disentangle from that, really

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.740 align:middle line:90%
insist that they disentangle.

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Sometimes, it
requires an intervention.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Because
this is an addiction.

01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:15.630 align:middle line:90%
The technology is an addiction.

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And so is the
egregore is an addiction.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I talked to you
about, fill the withdrawal.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:24.761 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Fill the withdrawal.

01:02:24.761 --> 01:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
As that space opens up,
you need to fill it.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:29.901 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, you
fill it with yourself.

01:02:29.901 --> 01:02:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, indeed.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.210 align:middle line:90%
We have just like a second left.

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Final thought?

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Just
reflect on your life.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you decide
where you want to go.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.402 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that the
activities and the people

01:02:42.402 --> 01:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and the things
you're involved with

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
are helping you
achieve your goals.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you're going to have
to give something in return.

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to help them too.

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But just say, is this
a healthy relationship

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:54.040 align:middle line:90%
that I'm involved in?

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer is
yes, stay with it.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.590 align:middle line:90%
