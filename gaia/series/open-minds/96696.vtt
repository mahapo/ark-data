00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:06.480 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Earlier we spoke

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.950 align:middle line:10%
with Nicolas David Ngan
about our contracts

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.674 align:middle line:10%
with our soul partners in life.

00:00:10.674 --> 00:00:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going
to learn about how

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.535 align:middle line:84%
understanding our soul contracts
can help us raise our children.

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:38.484 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.484 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas, this is
going to be fun.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
This is part two of
our conversation.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:84%
In the last
conversation we talked

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:84%
about how we can use
the soul contract

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:84%
work to be able to not just
understand but maximize

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
our relationships,
and also to be

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:84%
able to see when we
are done, we're done,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.791 align:middle line:84%
when we've completed our tasks
together with no judgment.

00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:90%
And that was really beautiful.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion
of-- I love the bit

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:84%
toward the end, just because
my girlfriends are always--

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:90%
where all the good men?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
They're there,
they're just maybe

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:90%
still wearing boys' clothes.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And you talked about
that a little bit, too.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So now let's say we grow
up, we end up together.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we've decided we're going to
bring a family into the world.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So just give us an
overview of that dynamic

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.940 align:middle line:84%
before we start diving into
very specific cases such as you

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and your son, me and my son,
and another study as well.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NICOLAS DAVID NGAN: Well the
really fascinating phenomenon

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.935 align:middle line:10%
of the rainbow, indigo,
and crystal children

00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:10%
who are coming in,
and-- all those names

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:10%
are for the different
level of consciousness

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:10%
and love these
children bring through.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the parenting
experience that we're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
having today-- I have a
13-year-old son-- it's

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
completely different to,
say, the parenting experience

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
our parents went through 40,
50 years ago in raising us.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:84%
They were less conscious
because of the time,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
whereas now we're
more conscious.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.315 align:middle line:84%
And we're past 2012 and
the massive transition

00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness is
happening all around us.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the
dismantling of all

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
the old hierarchical systems
which have been maintaining

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:90%
masculine control of the world.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And we've made a shift into
the more-- re-balancing

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
to the feminine, the
goddess coming back online.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So what's required is to
bring in more and more beings

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
of a higher level
of consciousness

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
to actually ensure their
transformation happens.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's in the
form of our children.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of very
high-frequency beings

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:84%
are coming to Earth, many who
have never been here before,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:90%
and embodying as our children.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.731 align:middle line:90%
And they are the future.

00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Not just for what
they'll do in the world,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:90%
just from their very presence.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they're coming
in more conscious.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Because what I've
noticed is that children

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.373 align:middle line:84%
have a much lower level of
karma than, say, we did.

00:03:05.373 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hm.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: I've had clients--
some of these children

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:14.267 align:middle line:84%
are grown-- clients who are in
their twenties who have worked

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:90%
through their karma.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
They act like someone of
our sort of generation

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
in their fifties who spent 30
years working on themselves.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And they've hit 20
and they've done it.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
that's not fair.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is they had a
lower load from the beginning.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But coming into the Earth
plane requires everyone

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:84%
to have some karmic patterns,
some negative context

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:84%
to work through and
transmute into our gift,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.079 align:middle line:90%
as I've spoken about previously.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So they have a bit
of karma, but it's

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:90%
nothing like what we've had.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is that, they'll
get used to the Earth plane.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
They have to have some of that
harder experience, but not

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:90%
long term.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:84%
For a shorter period, just so
they get used to how it works.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Because many of them
come from different parts

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, and because
they haven't been here before,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:84%
they actually don't
know how it works.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.640 align:middle line:84%
How do these murky, messy
human emotions work down here?

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they've come
to experience that.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's a glow from their
souls, an enormous level

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
love that comes through,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.941 align:middle line:84%
because many of them don't
lose that connection to source.

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:84%
And if you look in a baby's
eyes, when they come out,

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:90%
you can see god in their eyes.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:90%
It's an enormous depth.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.843 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:22.843 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It's incredible.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But what happens nowadays
is that our job as parents

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.109 align:middle line:84%
is to maintain that
glow in their eyes.

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:32.650 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
primary objective

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:90%
of being a conscious parent.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, our
system certainly

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:90%
isn't set up towards that.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: The system is
not set up for that yet.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But our job as conscious
spiritual parents

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:90%
is to maintain that.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can maintain
that-- that look of god coming

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.000 align:middle line:84%
out of their eyes,
that pure innocence,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that deep void
energy-- you can see

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:84%
the universe in their
eyes-- to the age of seven,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
there's a good chance
that they'll make it,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.909 align:middle line:84%
they'll stay conscious for
the rest of their lives.

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Now these kids are coming in
with different kinds of names.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know-- I had
the experience, which

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.887 align:middle line:84%
was really fascinating--
a number of years

00:05:13.887 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
ago, in particular, I seemed to
be in that groove for a while,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
where I would know a
woman who was pregnant,

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and get a sense--
not just a sense,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I would be delivered
a very specific name,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.734 align:middle line:90%
I assumed from the baby.

00:05:26.734 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I even
started doing what

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I called baby readings, which
happened only in the week

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:90%
prior to the birth.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Very specific names were given,
and they were not necessarily

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:84%
the ones that the
parent had chosen.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.612 align:middle line:84%
But in one
circumstance-- and I may

00:05:40.612 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:84%
have mentioned this
when we spoke before,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.924 align:middle line:90%
I may not have-- I have a niece.

00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Before she came in I did
a little baby reading

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
about what she was looking to
fulfill in this lifetime, who

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.642 align:middle line:84%
her stronger relationships
were, where her creativity was--

00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:90%
and this has borne out.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:90%
She's 25 now.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But in that time, in that
meditation that night,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
she told me-- the
being said, my name

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
is-- it was either
Alexander or Alexandra.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if it
was a boy or girl.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.876 align:middle line:84%
So I called my sister
the next morning--

00:06:09.876 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:90%
have you chosen a name?

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:90%
I hope not!

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, we
just chose one last night.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, what was it?

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, it was
Alexander or Alexandra.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm bringing this
up because that soul

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
came to two different sets
of people on the same night

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:90%
and said, that is my name.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
That's my name I'm
going to live by.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:90%
We all got the message.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So now with these
new kids coming in,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:84%
are they bringing in
maybe a different kind

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.977 align:middle line:90%
of name, sounds with them?

00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Are they effectively
reaching through?

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Or are we tagging them with some
very common names of the past?

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It's more the former.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.762 align:middle line:84%
The children coming through have
a lot of very high frequency

00:06:50.762 --> 00:06:52.178 align:middle line:84%
energies in their
chart, like what

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.673 align:middle line:84%
we call 10-1s which
is the balance

00:06:53.673 --> 00:06:56.460 align:middle line:84%
of the male/female aspect
with god coming through.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Lots of 5s, which is
the pure, etheric truth

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:90%
of the soul coming through.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.955 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are barely grounded.

00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But I've noticed there's
a real high frequency

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:84%
strand that goes
through these children,

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:90%
these conscious children.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And so they're actually making
sure they get the right name.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.143 align:middle line:84%
Because they've gone through
what we went through,

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:84%
they looked at, OK-- OK, you
two are nominated as my parents,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:84%
because I want this
particular experience.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to have it my way.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to choose a
name that's going to probably

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.753 align:middle line:90%
blow your socks off.

00:07:25.753 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come and
I'm going to stretch you

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.641 align:middle line:90%
with my frequency.

00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to have to grow
if you're going to raise me.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.914 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to teach
you how to wake up.

00:07:32.914 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that where you get,
like, Resh Tunae, or something?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.163 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something
you can't even begin

00:07:37.163 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to relate to in our
normal parlance as of now?

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Well, they--

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How are they doing it?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.501 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you-- give us an
example of some of these kids

00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:84%
that have come in and some of
the interesting kinds of names

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:90%
they're incarnated with.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, they don't
necessarily-- some of them

00:07:51.495 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:90%
are edge of the names.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And some parents have-- will
go for the real spiritual type

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:90%
names for their kids.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But some are quite--
seem quite conventional.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.216 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually
look at the numbers

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:84%
it's actually--
you can feel it's

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
really futuristic-- it's a real
modern, real high frequency

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:90%
feel to the name.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.957 align:middle line:84%
They're not so
stuck in the matrix.

00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us a
couple of examples

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:84%
of names like that, that
have this futuristic, flowing

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.045 align:middle line:90%
feeling to them.

00:08:18.045 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well my
son, for example,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.300 align:middle line:90%
is Gabriel Jonah Alleh-Ngan.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's a mixture of French,
Spanish, and English.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And then sort of
anglicized Chinese.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he had made his
mind up from the beginning.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
Because we could
feel-- when he was-- he

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:90%
was conceived in Florence.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And we were at the Uffizi.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.688 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And we saw
lots of pictures

00:08:44.688 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
of the angel Gabriel coming
to Mary with the annunciation.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
figured out where he'd

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.840 align:middle line:84%
been conceived,
what happened was,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:90%
we thought-- that's a Gabriel.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was really
clear for both of you.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It was very clear.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.408 align:middle line:84%
Because literally
the angel Gabriel

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:58.142 align:middle line:90%
was talking to Ahlmeirah.

00:08:58.142 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And she thought she
was going a bit nuts.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.266 align:middle line:84%
But it was him coming
through, saying, hey,

00:09:02.266 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
this is what I
want to be called.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:90%
So OK, we have the first part.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Then we knew it was going to
be the Alleh and the Ngan.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:90%
And we could feel him already.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:84%
His energy was very strong
when he was in Ahlmeirah.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And we tried out lots of
names, because we knew,

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.453 align:middle line:90%
we have to get this right.

00:09:17.453 --> 00:09:19.136 align:middle line:84%
We can't mess this
kid's life up.

00:09:19.136 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:90%
But he was right there.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And his energy was
like, just wait.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:90%
It'll come.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And we'd play with it.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.864 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until he was born
and he was sitting in the ward.

00:09:29.864 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And across from Ahlmeirah in
the ward was a Spanish lady.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.847 align:middle line:90%
And she called her son Jonah.

00:09:34.847 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And Ahlmeirah heard that,
and she said, that's it.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
Nicolas, go an try it out.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Tty it on the software.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And we did it, and
it was perfect.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what he'd
done is he'd set

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:84%
it up to make sure
we had no alternative

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:90%
but to get the right name.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the kids are very strong
on what they want to be called.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So they'll get
the effect of what

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
you had-- she made sure
that Auntie and Mom got

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.410 align:middle line:90%
the right name.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if I don't
get that name,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
my mission's not going to
happen the way I want it.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:10:01.493 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
This is so important for
parents to realize that,

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.100 align:middle line:84%
to have that openness,
and not just say,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.682 align:middle line:84%
hey, Grandma was named
this, and on the other side

00:10:08.682 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Grandma was named that--
no, that's not the way

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.681 align:middle line:90%
to choose a name anymore.

00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes a child might
come through that way.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's important just
to flow with the process.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.691 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So what now happens
with conscious parenting is

00:10:20.691 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that people say to me, OK,
we've got two months to go.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Gotta sort the name out.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.822 align:middle line:84%
Because they know what-- they
know the effect of the soul

00:10:27.822 --> 00:10:28.780 align:middle line:90%
contract, what it does.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that might be
more if they're not hearing it,

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
they're not already
getting it, so to speak.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: They'll come
through with, OK, we've

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
got the beginning and the
end, just like we had,

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:90%
but we're missing the middle.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, we're
getting a bit desperate.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.950 align:middle line:90%
We-- we can't get it wrong.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is,
I say, just wait.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And then when he or she is
born, hold them and just see--

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:90%
and you'll feel it.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And what happens then
is that the child is--

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
the soul is much more embodied
by the time they're born.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the parents
sort of know.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And they'll come up with maybe
two or three basic ideas,

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll look
at all those names

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that the name
is optimal from the beginning.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So the name supports the
child, and actually supports

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:84%
the whole family dynamic, both
parents and the other siblings,

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.860 align:middle line:90%
so we minimize clashes.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So the child has has a place
in the family constellation,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:84%
a certain type of transmission,
because each main family

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.204 align:middle line:90%
member helps each other.

00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we make sure the
position is optimized so you

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:90%
make a really good start.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And so because the
child has already

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
designed this-- in
fact, all the souls

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
had designed this
pre-incarnationally--

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.486 align:middle line:84%
what happens then is that
the whole dynamic shifts.

00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Parents' buttons
are always going

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to be pressed by
having the kids,

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
because the parents are going
to have to rise in consciousness

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:90%
to be with the children.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.697 align:middle line:84%
But it's part of the service
that conscious children bring,

00:11:48.697 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:90%
that rainbows and indigos bring.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.286 align:middle line:84%
They're here to
teach us to wake up.

00:11:53.286 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I sometimes
wonder, with my son

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Gabriel, who's the parent?

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.865 align:middle line:84%
Always says to me,
you should know, Dad.

00:11:57.865 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:90%
You're the parent.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But he actually
figured it out already.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And then-- OK, so let's say
we very carefully listen,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
or carefully help craft,
along with intuition,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
the name for this
child, to get them off

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.594 align:middle line:90%
to exactly the right start.

00:12:11.594 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And then next thing we
know we're calling them

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:90%
bubie, or something.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We resort to some kind
of familiar nickname--

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:84%
doesn't that kind of
blow the whole thing?

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, once the name
is on the birth certificate,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that's still the primary
cake of their life,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
as we talk about in the previous
relationships interview.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing
there with a short name

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:84%
is, actually it's
reducing the frequencies.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Short nicknames tend to
disempower people, usually.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is that, you see,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
a rapidly growing
childhood consciousness

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:84%
is a challenge for
all around them.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:90%
It's normal.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.474 align:middle line:84%
But they came here not
to fit into the matrix,

00:12:49.474 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:84%
they came here to
blow the matrix.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.660 align:middle line:84%
They came here to
transform, bring bubbles

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.204 align:middle line:90%
of higher consciousness.

00:12:55.204 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's millions of
them on the Earth now.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.536 align:middle line:84%
And if enough of
them come-- which

00:12:58.536 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
is what's happening--
they spread their bubbles,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:84%
holographic bubbles
of consciousness.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.291 align:middle line:84%
And higher conscious naturally
raises lower consciousness.

00:13:07.291 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it works.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.706 align:middle line:84%
So enough of them transmit
that pure love that they carry,

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that purity you see in
their eye when they're

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:84%
born-- if they maintain that,
then everyone else rises

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.434 align:middle line:90%
in frequency.

00:13:16.434 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why things are
getting better on Earth.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.808 align:middle line:84%
Because enough
higher-consciousness

00:13:19.808 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:84%
beings are just present,
transmuting the unconsciousness

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and negativity of
the rest of us.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:90%
You came in earlier.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what's actually going on.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, is it time to
maybe take a look at your chart

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.622 align:middle line:84%
with Gabriel, or do we have
more foundational-- foundation

00:13:37.622 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:90%
to lay on this subject?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: A little
more foundation.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:39.928 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please.

00:13:39.928 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
So our job as conscious
parents is not

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
to raise our children
the way we were raised.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:90%
That's heading for disaster.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But that will be
instinctively what

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:84%
we will want to do initially,
because that's imprinted on us.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.434 align:middle line:84%
When we've had no
sleep for six weeks,

00:13:57.434 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
we will instinctively
go back to the way

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:90%
our mother or father treated us.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:90%
I did this.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Then I realized that's
not going to work.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Because he doesn't like this.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it will bring up
our own unresolved issues

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:90%
at trigger ages for us.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So if we consciously know what
that is, we can work on that.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to flow with the
natural energy of the child.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So if we understand the
child's soul contract

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.536 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning, we can
then know where their strengths

00:14:23.536 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and weaknesses are, what
their karmic patterns are,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.712 align:middle line:84%
to support them and not
rub their noses in it.

00:14:28.712 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Know where their strengths
are to support them,

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:90%
to get out there.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.677 align:middle line:84%
So when a child feels
from the very beginning

00:14:33.677 --> 00:14:36.010 align:middle line:84%
that a parent knows exactly
how they tick-- because they

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.427 align:middle line:84%
obviously named
them consciously--

00:14:37.427 --> 00:14:39.135 align:middle line:84%
it's a different
relationship altogether.

00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:84%
They're not actually
fighting the parent.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:84%
The parents-- our job,
as conscious parents,

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:84%
is to be custodians
to raise these beings.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.205 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
actually-- they're only

00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:49.765 align:middle line:90%
in childrens' bodies, actually.

00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
They're very highly
conscious beings and masters,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:90%
a lot of them.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I was on a weekend the
other weekend, a father and son

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:84%
weekend, and the
six-year-old-- one six-year-old

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
there was speaking
like an adult.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, my
god, he's so strong.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.282 align:middle line:84%
His father was having
trouble just disciplining him

00:15:06.282 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:84%
because he was so
conscious, and it

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:90%
was very clear what he wanted.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're supporting
the child to grow.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.696 align:middle line:84%
And we treat them
more like an adult,

00:15:15.696 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's
appropriate for someone

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:90%
in a, say, a six-year-old body.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.190 align:middle line:84%
But actually that empowers them,
and it brings on their gifts.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Because our job is to maintain
that spark of god in their eye

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:84%
so they don't go to sleep,
and to ensure the school

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:84%
system and the work
doesn't put them to sleep.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So they can then be in their
power from the very beginning.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And if they can do that, and
they believe in themselves

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and we maintain that-- which
is what Gabriel, my son,

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.162 align:middle line:84%
has managed to do-- then
they can go out in the world

00:15:42.162 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and have total belief that they
can do pretty much anything

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:90%
they like.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And because of the higher
consciousness they carry,

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.634 align:middle line:90%
they can.

00:15:49.634 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
He seems to manifest-- if
he really wants something,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:90%
it just happens.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:90%
No matter what.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.049 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Because their consciousness
comes through--

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So clean and clear.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.039 align:middle line:90%
It magnetizes that reality.

00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.288 align:middle line:90%
It magnetizes it.

00:16:02.288 --> 00:16:04.512 align:middle line:90%
Because they're open to God.

00:16:04.512 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And that frequency coming
through them actually

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.303 align:middle line:84%
manifests, literally,
stuff out of thin air.

00:16:08.303 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
That's just how
manifestation works.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.416 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- our job is to make
sure they can still do that,

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and they don't get
lost in it, glaze over.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of Gabriel's
friends have glazed over

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
because of the unconsciousness
of their parents.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:90%
They can't help themselves.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:90%
They're just the way they are.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Well now-- OK.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:84%
You said a word a moment
ago, which was discipline.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know how to
discipline the six-year-old son.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Discipline in the old
sense doesn't really

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:84%
work with these
children anyway, and we

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:84%
need to abandon that
notion and maybe

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:90%
abandon the word altogether.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's another kind of word.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.980 align:middle line:84%
What is-- how would
you view that?

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
If you see the child
doing something

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that may be going
down the wrong lane,

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
or a little bit harmful on some
level-- in place of discipline,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.902 align:middle line:84%
how do you motivate them
then to correct course?

00:16:54.902 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, I'd say
it's more-- I mean,

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.068 align:middle line:84%
I face this challenge
all the time.

00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It's more about holding a safe
space and explaining to them,

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
when they're old enough,
what the contract is.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing this,
we're holding a safe space.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do this
because of-- if you possibly

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle line:84%
do this you're going
to get yourself

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.150 align:middle line:84%
in trouble, because
that's in your contract.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And you might have
noticed the couple

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
of times you did act
impulsively, look

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:90%
what happened.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes, Dad.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.176 align:middle line:90%
I've learned the hard way.

00:17:21.176 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do that again.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Or, you need a certain
amount of sleep, all right,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:90%
because of your growing.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's about
explaining why so he

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:90%
sees the reasoning behind that.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.494 align:middle line:84%
Safety-- it's just not getting
yourself into too much trouble,

00:17:36.494 --> 00:17:38.160 align:middle line:84%
because kids are
testing the boundaries.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's holding that safe--
they need firm boundaries,

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.395 align:middle line:84%
but they need firm boundaries
enforced with reason.

00:17:45.395 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Not just because I said so.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't wash at all.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It does not work.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And also
setting by example.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.252 align:middle line:90%
So I find I'm challenged.

00:17:55.252 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:90%
I have to set the right example.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.215 align:middle line:84%
Because if I don't
he won't respond.

00:17:58.215 --> 00:18:00.465 align:middle line:84%
He'll say, well, you're not
doing it, so why should I?

00:18:00.465 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to punish
takes the lights out.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.734 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Well--

00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
not a good idea.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.566 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Not
necessarily, actually.

00:18:06.566 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
It's more about explaining
consequences and structure

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:90%
of why that happens.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And then these kids realize, oh,
OK, I'm pushing too hard again.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.324 align:middle line:84%
This is what is going
to happen if I do that.

00:18:16.324 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I didn't realize that.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't like
that idea at all.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.677 align:middle line:90%
So they can come back.

00:18:21.677 --> 00:18:22.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Self-correct.

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: They'll self-correct.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.705 align:middle line:84%
And if we give them the
space to self-correct,

00:18:27.705 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:90%
that's empowering.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But you can only go
so far, sometimes.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you do
have to intervene.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's done in a loving way.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And when a child realizes
that you're actually

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
working consciously with
the flow of who they are,

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.480 align:middle line:90%
they respond quite differently.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Because they realize
in the moment

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.720 align:middle line:84%
it's not rubbing me
up the wrong way.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
flowing with me.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.956 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No friction.

00:18:45.956 --> 00:18:46.577 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:46.577 --> 00:18:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Minimizing the friction.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.618 align:middle line:84%
Obviously there always
will be something.

00:18:49.618 --> 00:18:51.484 align:middle line:90%
But we're flowing with them.

00:18:51.484 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Then they're going to
react quite differently.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they realize they
totally understand me.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is, just realize

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I can't hide anything from him,
because he knows how I tick.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So the parents, they have
a manual with this work.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.110 align:middle line:90%
They have the map of the child.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So they can see where they're
going, so they can support them

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:84%
in what they wanted to
do, in terms of growing,

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.195 align:middle line:84%
and catch them when
things go a bit astray.

00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, say they have
disempowering experiences

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:90%
at school.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And the parent will
be ready for that,

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
because they know it's probably
going to happen at some stage,

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:90%
because they've got the chart.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:90%
So they're prepared for that.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So things-- there
are less surprises.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.822 align:middle line:84%
So when a child falls,
you want to make

00:19:28.822 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:84%
sure you catch them
earlier, and you've already

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
worked out, usually, what
are we going to do with that?

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's more allowing the child
their natural growth process,

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:84%
but maintaining their
conscious boundaries,

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.450 align:middle line:84%
so they don't stray too far,
they don't get themselves

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.830 align:middle line:90%
in serious trouble.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And a child will feel very safe.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And we, as parents, have
to grow to hold that space.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:90%
We have to set the example.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're the ones growing
just as much as they are.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.897 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:19:56.897 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, now would it be time
to take a look at your chart?

00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yours and Gabriel's.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And look at what your
contract is together.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, people will be
able to see this on the screen.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you just let
them know whether we're

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.810 align:middle line:84%
looking at the first, second,
third, or fourth columns

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:90%
from the left over.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll be able
to identify the numbers.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: OK.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So Gabriel Jonah Alleh-Ngan is
the fifth column on the chart.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:10%
And he was very clever when he
designed his name, because what

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:10%
he did is he put, in
both the physical talent

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:10%
position and the
spiritual talent position,

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:10%
double nines, which is
the most powerful energy.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:90%
It's that squiggly dragon.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So what he did is he said, OK,
I'm going to come to Earth.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
He says to me, I'm going to
come to Earth and have some fun.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.415 align:middle line:90%
That's me priority.

00:20:44.415 --> 00:20:45.772 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have fun.

00:20:45.772 --> 00:20:48.230 align:middle line:10%
But he also made sure that he
had the most powerful numbers

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.271 align:middle line:10%
in the talent position,
because then they move up

00:20:50.271 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:10%
to the adjacent physical
karma and spiritual goals,

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:10%
and the adjacent spiritual
karmic three and spiritual

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:10%
growth 13-4.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.257 align:middle line:10%
So the nine can burn through
any pattern most rapidly.

00:21:02.257 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's one that
you said earlier is also--

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.634 align:middle line:84%
can be very dominated or
repressed by nature, from--

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: If it's in karmic
position or goal position,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.925 align:middle line:90%
but he put them in talents.

00:21:11.925 --> 00:21:12.841 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:12.841 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So it's a positive--
it's a positive dragon,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:84%
it's a real powerful,
unstoppable force,

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.334 align:middle line:90%
which is what he is.

00:21:20.334 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:90%
So he put it in there.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So he knew-- he said, I know
I have to have some karma.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have some issues.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to make sure I
burn it through real quick,

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.670 align:middle line:84%
because that's just part
of the deal of coming here.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Then I can get on with the
good stuff in life, which

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:90%
is what's actually happening.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:10%
So, for example, he has
10-1 in physical karma.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's about having
his masculine disempowered

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.210 align:middle line:90%
at times.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, it's
an absence of father.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Like, I work very hard, and
occasionally I overdo it,

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and I don't give him
enough attention.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:90%
I slip up.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So therefore I need to
make more time for him.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that
happened with the 10-1,

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
because it's disempowerment, is
that he had bullying at school.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He had bullying?

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Bullying at
school a few times.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:90%
But we caught that early.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But because he had-- and this
can get really, really terrible

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:90%
for some children.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.995 align:middle line:84%
It can be bullying
all-- continuously-- one

00:22:11.995 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:84%
of my business
partners, his daughter's

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.662 align:middle line:90%
really bullied seriously.

00:22:14.662 --> 00:22:16.578 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you seen
that actually impacted

00:22:16.578 --> 00:22:18.140 align:middle line:84%
by changing the
name, where someone's

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:90%
dealing with a lot of bullying?

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: By changing the
name you can put more power

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:90%
into their name.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.392 align:middle line:84%
It burns through
the program quicker.

00:22:25.392 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But we caught the
bullying earlier.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And we knew for,
say, for that 10-1,

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that the best thing for
a child with karmic 10-1

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:84%
is to learn, say, a
martial arts discipline.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So they learn to use
their power properly

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:90%
from a sensei or a teacher.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Because children
with a 10-1 come

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
from what we call the
ascended master stream of soul

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
development, which is where they
work with the hierarchy of God,

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So they used to be
in mystery schools,

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:84%
they used to be
monks in past lives.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
They used to be in
different orders.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.800 align:middle line:90%
And so we sent him to judo.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's been doing
that since about seven.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as he
got into that--

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:84%
after a few years of that
he got really strong,

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:90%
he got very confident.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
He learned how to use
his power properly

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.390 align:middle line:90%
without fear from his teacher.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.737 align:middle line:84%
And after that,
no more bullying.

00:23:17.737 --> 00:23:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.364 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:19.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Done.

00:23:19.905 --> 00:23:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, hopefully it's done.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Cross fingers.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Cross fingers.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: So he went through that.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.070 align:middle line:84%
By the time he was like 12, 13,
he's not having to face that.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Where someone who
didn't have that pattern

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
will be facing that
their whole life.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: At home, at work.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:90%
In their relationship.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So he effectively
moved to neutralize

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.143 align:middle line:84%
all his patterns quicker and
bring on their positive gifts.

00:23:44.143 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, now what about
this spiritual karma.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Here you have-- well,
initially the nines,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.767 align:middle line:84%
and he has the threes, which was
similar to another relationship

00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:55.183 align:middle line:84%
we looked at in the last show,
where there were some nines

00:23:55.183 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:90%
and threes.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
But in spiritual karma, what's
that mean for him as threes,

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and then, I guess, with
your name now, 17-8?

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: OK.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:09.087 align:middle line:10%
The threes there mean that
he feels shy to show himself.

00:24:09.087 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Shy?

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NGAN: Part of the ego feels
unworthy to show itself truly.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:10%
And so he's learning
to show more himself.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:84%
He plays-- he's a
very gifted musician.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So he's learning to
communicate through music.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.795 align:middle line:84%
And he's played some
concerts at school.

00:24:27.795 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:84%
He plays in a rock band,
and things like that.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.027 align:middle line:90%
And he actually comes out.

00:24:31.027 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, man
this is-- this is amazing.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What does he play?

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: He plays
electronic keyboard.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So he's coming out through his
performance, showing himself.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.407 align:middle line:84%
So the nines there-- my
nine's in spiritual karma,

00:24:45.407 --> 00:24:46.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
catalytic, go across

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.050 align:middle line:84%
to his threes to burn
through that unwillingness.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's his nines
and his-- column

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:90%
five in his spirit charts go up.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So he's made sure that
he's going to burn that

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.034 align:middle line:84%
through so he can become a
communicator of deep knowledge

00:24:59.034 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:84%
through, probably,
his performance

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:90%
music and his writing.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But also, his nine
comes across to my 22-4

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:84%
in column one, talent gateway,
up to my double nines.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.410 align:middle line:90%
So he's actually roasting me.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:90%
He's actually--

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Rescuing you?

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Roasting me.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, roasting you.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Energetically.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:84%
He's actually pushing me to
keep coming into my power

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:90%
just by his presence.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So anyone around him gets pushed
on, because his physical talent

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.660 align:middle line:84%
nines and spiritual talents
nines in column five

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.281 align:middle line:84%
are going into the physical
and spiritual talent gateways

00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:34.530 align:middle line:90%
of anyone in contact with him.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.604 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to press
everyone's buttons.

00:25:36.604 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And does he?

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yep.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Because his job is to
actually catalyze people to

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:90%
wake up just by his presence.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what do
you do with this boy

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:90%
where education is concerned?

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, for conscious
children, as a special parent,

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
we face the-- OK, he needs to
go to an alternative school.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:90%
So we looked into that.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
We looked into going to
Steiner, for example,

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.549 align:middle line:84%
because it was a school
we could have moved to.

00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:06.590 align:middle line:90%
About an hour away from--

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Waldorf schools, yes.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.089 align:middle line:90%
Where we used to live.

00:26:09.089 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But the thing with
conscious children

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.005 align:middle line:84%
is not to have
any-- we learned--

00:26:12.005 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:84%
not to have any preconceived
ideas on what they should have,

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:90%
because each of them is unique.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And the thing with understanding
their soul contract

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:84%
is that we can parent
them in a custom

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:84%
way, not using generic parenting
patterns, which don't always

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.990 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.660 align:middle line:84%
But we can custom parent them
based on the soul contract.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But that also means,
with the school,

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.766 align:middle line:84%
we need to see
what's going to fit

00:26:33.766 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:84%
best at this stage
of their education

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:90%
and not get fixed on it.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So we looked at Steiner schools,
but it didn't feel right.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And we had friends who had
a similar sort of child.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And they sent her to
the Steiner school.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was they don't
teach them to read until eight.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't follow
their natural flow.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.465 align:middle line:84%
But these children
are very precious--

00:26:51.465 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.924 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And she
wanted to read now.

00:26:54.924 --> 00:26:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:90%
That is a problem.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.582 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: She left after a
few years, because-- there's

00:26:59.582 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
nothing wrong with
the school, it's

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.220 align:middle line:84%
just that it didn't fit
specifically for her.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So we had the same-- we had
the feeling that it wouldn't

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.698 align:middle line:90%
be quite right for him.

00:27:05.698 --> 00:27:07.660 align:middle line:90%
He needs a faster track.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up actually going
to good state schools, which

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.320 align:middle line:84%
is the last thing
we thought we'd do.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But actually,
because they're more

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.439 align:middle line:84%
focused on the academic
achievement thing,

00:27:17.439 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
we discovered he
actually likes that.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:84%
He likes the stimulation
and the pressure

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.750 align:middle line:90%
to actually achieve things.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.910 align:middle line:90%
So that fitted for him.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.167 align:middle line:84%
But another child may
not like that at all.

00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's about seeing, well,
how does the child turn out?

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:90%
What's driving them?

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Which is what we
see in the contract.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And then adjusting the
schooling accordingly.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And it may have been that
he-- some of these children

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.622 align:middle line:84%
go to an alternative
school for a while,

00:27:41.622 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:84%
then they need to make
a shift to a state

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.510 align:middle line:84%
school, or a private school,
depending on where they are.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched
friends do this.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.684 align:middle line:84%
And it's just about going
in the moment with it.

00:27:50.684 --> 00:27:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Because getting the right school
is critical for these children.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're not
in the right place,

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:90%
they can get very unhappy.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.967 align:middle line:84%
Because they know when
it's not true for them.

00:27:58.967 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They have a very strong
sense of what's true

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and what's not true
about themselves,

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.602 align:middle line:84%
and what others
are saying a well.

00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's another
critical juncture in life

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
where we need to
look into the name,

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
determine what kind

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.000 align:middle line:84%
of environment, stimulation
they need at a certain age--

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.211 align:middle line:90%
any given age.

00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Because some are
naturally very powerful,

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:18.950 align:middle line:90%
like Gabriel.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But some are much more delicate
and much more sensitive,

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:90%
and are very etheric.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.479 align:middle line:84%
And so they need a more
gentle environment.

00:28:25.479 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So they type of school--
even amongst, say,

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.810 align:middle line:84%
state schools or
private schools,

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
or alternative schools-- you've
got to pick it so it fits well.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Like, a child with--
so I've got a friend

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.700 align:middle line:84%
whose child is at a
4-5 fives, which is

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:90%
the most hypersensitive energy.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:84%
They found a very gentle
state school, primary school,

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:90%
for her.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.101 align:middle line:84%
And she loves it, because it's
small, it's not a huge one,

00:28:46.101 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:84%
but that's actually
nurturing her to come,

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.690 align:middle line:84%
to ground, and get on with her
life, and come in the body.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:90%
But that's what suited her.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd used all this
work to actually work it out,

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
what was going to be
best for her, you see?

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's enabled her to
customize the growing

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.370 align:middle line:90%
environment for the children.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
actually doing here.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.528 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what
else do we need

00:29:07.528 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:90%
to look at in Gabriel's chart?

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:14.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, there's a 10-1
in both physical karma and--

00:29:14.305 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
noticed that, yeah.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Coming into
power's the big issue.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.465 align:middle line:84%
There's always
going to be issues

00:29:19.465 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
of the proper use of
power, and there's also

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:84%
going to be issues of having
to work hard at things.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:84%
From a very young age
he was saying to us,

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:90%
it's really hard work, Dad.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.491 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- the interpretation
is you got to work hard

00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:90%
at life.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So we try and make sure
that it's no too hard.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.670 align:middle line:90%
It's in balance.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But the other major issue is
the 11-2 in physical goals.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
The 11 is all about
finding structure

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:90%
in life for new things.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.385 align:middle line:84%
So a child with an 11-2
needs lots of structure.

00:29:49.385 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:84%
All children need structure,
but a one with an 11-2

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:90%
needs even more structure.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.014 align:middle line:84%
Like, we used to need to
give him a week's notice

00:29:55.014 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
before we go on
holiday, otherwise

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:84%
he'd have a fit because
the routine has just

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:90%
gone out the window.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So we'd say, if you give
him a week's notice, he's fine.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you give him two days,
like, it's not going to work.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could this
have something to do,

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
both the 10-1s and the 11-2s
with the fact that some

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.370 align:middle line:84%
of these beings are incarnating
in for maybe the first time,

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:16.320 align:middle line:84%
or relatively new to
the Earth experience?

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Trying to find
their power, trying

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.247 align:middle line:90%
to find structure and all.

00:30:19.247 --> 00:30:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It can be
partially to do with that,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.580 align:middle line:84%
but it's particularly
marked with an 11-2.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:10%
So we soon learned quickly to
give him lots of structure,

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:10%
and not to say just go and try
it out, because it won't work.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.580 align:middle line:84%
We take it step by step--
here's how we do this new thing.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And we'll support
you, we'll give you

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.418 align:middle line:90%
different ways of doing this.

00:30:38.418 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And once he's got
it it integrates--

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:90%
it seems to go slow initially.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly it takes
off, he's got it.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.185 align:middle line:90%
And then he just does it.

00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, OK, he's
got that one OK.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.290 align:middle line:90%
So then we do the next one.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So structure for this sort
of child is very important.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And the two indicates
he's very sensitive.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be
gentle with them.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise he can be
subject to shock and freeze

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:90%
up very easily.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So even though he's very
powerful, he's very sensitive.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's a balance of-- it's
a balance of maintaining

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.610 align:middle line:84%
good, clear boundaries around
the north power in the chart--

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:17.000 align:middle line:84%
because the two 9-- two
sets of 9s and two 10-1s--

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:84%
but also the
delicacy of the 11-2.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.099 align:middle line:84%
They can run really
powerfully, but then they

00:31:22.099 --> 00:31:24.640 align:middle line:84%
can almost-- if they hit a bad
bump they can almost collapse.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.429 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
how did that happen?

00:31:26.429 --> 00:31:27.845 align:middle line:84%
It's because of
their sensitivity.

00:31:27.845 --> 00:31:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And the other number,
the 13-4 there,

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.860 align:middle line:84%
is about coming into the
divine feminine flow.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And so he's a very-- he has
a very exquisite sort of love

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.610 align:middle line:90%
about him.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:46.820 align:middle line:84%
He's very loving and
unconditional, no matter what.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And the four's
about sharing that.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And we have a goal clash
here, with the fours.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.280 align:middle line:84%
With my birth name
in column one--

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.196 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, uh-huh.

00:31:54.196 --> 00:31:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Your fours down here in
spiritual goes in his 13-4.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.762 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:57.762 --> 00:32:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So we both feel that,
when we're around each other,

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.886 align:middle line:84%
we don't have enough
time for ourselves.

00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Because a four is about
learning to trust in the flow.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the goal position,
or the karmic position,

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.166 align:middle line:84%
it's the feeling, I'm
not getting enough

00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:90%
of God's abundance, or flow.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting enough time.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So we basically rub
up against each other,

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.547 align:middle line:84%
saying-- he might say to me,
when he was a bit younger,

00:32:17.547 --> 00:32:19.255 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting enough
of your time, Dad.

00:32:19.255 --> 00:32:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I'm
not getting enough time

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.823 align:middle line:84%
to do the things I need to
do around the house, or work,

00:32:22.823 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So time becomes an
issue between you two.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's always like this.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.530 align:middle line:84%
It's always pushing
on each other.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's a bit easier now,
because we're aware of it.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only major
clash we have in there, apart

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.467 align:middle line:84%
from me having to step
into my power as a parent,

00:32:37.467 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:90%
because the softer parent.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:84%
There's always a hard,
firmer parent, and then

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.390 align:middle line:90%
a softer parent.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm the softer parent.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Probably because
of my upbringing

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.237 align:middle line:84%
of having a very
difficult childhood.

00:32:48.237 --> 00:32:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:84%
As we talked about
in one of our pieces

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:84%
we did in Boulder, Colorado,
about the walk-in status,

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.314 align:middle line:84%
which-- we'll get into that
toward the end of this.

00:32:56.314 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So I need
to be the firmer

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:90%
parent, come into my power.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Then he feels safer.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.497 align:middle line:84%
So there's always
something happening.

00:33:03.497 --> 00:33:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's see, have
we pretty much covered

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:90%
the numbers in his chart?

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd just like to talk
about his mother, Ahlmeirah,

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:14.920 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.100 align:middle line:90%
In terms of the effect.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And she's the firmer
parent, just naturally.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And were we looking at--
column three or four, now?

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.279 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Say column
four especially.

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Because she's very
much in her power.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Because she has four 9s, and
they're both talent positions.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:90%
So she's an inherent match.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So if she says something,
he will just do it.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if I-- previously,
when he was younger,

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.999 align:middle line:84%
if I said something, he
may not do it at all.

00:33:39.999 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I wasn't-- I don't
have the same level of power

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:45.300 align:middle line:84%
in my new name, the
way I'm designed.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So when there's a match of nines
of-- they've both got four 9s,

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:53.910 align:middle line:84%
both got these dragon energies
in column four and five.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.535 align:middle line:84%
Then his dragon's going to
feel, OK, I met my match.

00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:90%
I'll just comply.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:57.842 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:57.842 --> 00:33:59.675 align:middle line:84%
Their physical talents
and spiritual talents

00:33:59.675 --> 00:34:01.450 align:middle line:90%
are both nines across the board.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: I'll just
do as I'm told.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.639 align:middle line:84%
And she used to say to me,
I don't have that problem.

00:34:05.639 --> 00:34:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With him?

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Why do you?

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's right here.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.531 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:09.531 --> 00:34:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So you can see where the
strength of each parent lies.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It's important for a parent to
go with their strength in both

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:21.090 align:middle line:84%
their birth and their
optimal current name,

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.100 align:middle line:84%
so they can work without
issue with a child.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's no point in a
parent trying to do something

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.620 align:middle line:90%
which they're not built for.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.289 align:middle line:84%
So if you play the heavy, it
just has no authenticity to it.

00:34:30.289 --> 00:34:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:90%
I-- I'm not built that way.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So with parenting you
each have different roles

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.400 align:middle line:84%
to meet different
needs of the child.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So this way you can see,
OK, who should be the one

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.328 align:middle line:84%
to teach them how to
get out in the world

00:34:42.328 --> 00:34:44.529 align:middle line:84%
and be confident, and
do that sort of stuff?

00:34:44.529 --> 00:34:46.070 align:middle line:84%
It could be the
mother or the father.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.361 align:middle line:90%
So you let them get on with it.

00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And who's going to do the
more nurturing, softer side?

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's the father this time.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And so by doing that everyone
follows their natural strength.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.219 align:middle line:84%
And the child feels it's more
natural, and it flows better.

00:34:57.219 --> 00:34:59.093 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, like
with all relationships,

00:34:59.093 --> 00:35:00.780 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
in the last piece,

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.950 align:middle line:84%
you have to get over
these preconceived notions

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and any ego attached, where I'm
supposed to be the firm one,

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.232 align:middle line:90%
she's the nurturer.

00:35:07.232 --> 00:35:07.731 align:middle line:90%
Well, no--

00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It doesn't
work, and it's

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:84%
confusing for the
child, because they

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.890 align:middle line:84%
know what's true
sooner than we do,

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.140 align:middle line:90%
because they're so sensitive.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.477 align:middle line:84%
See, so-- and you
can't lie to them,

00:35:17.477 --> 00:35:19.435 align:middle line:84%
you can't manipulate
them, because they'll just

00:35:19.435 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:90%
call us on it.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.731 align:middle line:84%
So therefore we got
to consciously go

00:35:21.731 --> 00:35:24.000 align:middle line:84%
with the flow of
the natural energy.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And when they see that
they go, ooh, I like this.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Then they're freer to
become more of themselves.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So they don't get
armored and they

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.690 align:middle line:84%
don't get suppressed like,
say, we did when we were kids.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.370 align:middle line:90%
So they get a much better start.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Anything else in there?

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: What's interesting
is that both his mother

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and I have 13-4s in our
optimal name, me in column two,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.470 align:middle line:84%
in physical talents, and
Ahlmeirah with column

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:90%
four in soul destiny.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So that helps him receive
that unconditional love

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.400 align:middle line:84%
of the divine feminine, which
is his goal in spiritual goals

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.260 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Neither of us had
that initially.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Both of us had issues with
our own biological mothers,

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:84%
so we get to overcome that and
get into the positive quality,

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:84%
so that he can
benefit from that.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it comes here that
he has benefited from that.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: He gets the
benefit of all our work.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the more we work
on ourselves as parents

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and clear our issues
in our contract,

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.220 align:middle line:84%
the less our children
have to process.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Because our children
are contracted

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.480 align:middle line:84%
to process our
unresolved issues.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.527 align:middle line:84%
So if we get clearer,
they get a better start.

00:36:31.527 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.682 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:33.682 --> 00:36:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: That's the last thing
I want to say about that one.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.973 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This will be
personally revealing,

00:36:37.973 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:84%
because we're looking
at me and my son.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So the names that we used,
as opposed to birth names

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.131 align:middle line:90%
are in column two and four.

00:36:48.131 --> 00:36:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yes.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:53.805 align:middle line:84%
So the-- I'll run through what's
happening briefly for you,

00:36:53.805 --> 00:36:54.889 align:middle line:90%
in column one.

00:36:54.889 --> 00:36:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll run
through what's running

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.270 align:middle line:90%
for Stewart in column three.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.665 align:middle line:90%
So we know what two cakes are.

00:37:00.665 --> 00:37:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The basics.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.081 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:37:02.081 --> 00:37:03.300 align:middle line:90%
The baseline.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So for you, Regina,
in physical karma,

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:11.030 align:middle line:84%
your issue's about
coming into your power

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:90%
relative to the masculine.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coming into
my powerful for what?

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Relative to the masculine.

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:17.522 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:17.522 --> 00:37:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So how's that been
playing out, just briefly,

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:20.782 align:middle line:90%
in your life?

00:37:20.782 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, well,
I mean, by the time--

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I used to play a lot of
sports when I was young.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.000 align:middle line:90%
I was just a good athlete.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So I did a lot of that, that
was my joy, being outdoors

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.890 align:middle line:90%
and playing a lot of sports.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that it
was playing indoors

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.090 align:middle line:90%
with dolls and books and things.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And then going into a very
masculine career path,

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.910 align:middle line:84%
being one of just a few
women in the country,

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and certainly in the world,
in the area of television

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.629 align:middle line:90%
sports when it was brand new.

00:37:49.629 --> 00:37:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got a
10-1 in physical karma

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.680 align:middle line:90%
and in spiritual talents.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much
finding the balance

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.940 align:middle line:90%
with your male female energy.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.687 align:middle line:84%
A woman functioning
in a man's world.

00:37:59.687 --> 00:38:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.561 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And also there's
nines in physical goals, which

00:38:02.561 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:84%
are about, again, coming into
your power out in the world.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And the 11-2s in
physical talents

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual
goals in column one

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is all about building
a body of knowledge,

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:19.250 align:middle line:84%
building the businesses,
Conscious Media Network,

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and just-- you like
building things, don't you?

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I always do.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:84%
What I generally have ended
up doing my whole life

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.290 align:middle line:90%
is a lot of first-ofs in media.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.995 align:middle line:84%
The first of this kind of
show, or that kind of show.

00:38:32.995 --> 00:38:33.776 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:33.776 --> 00:38:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And then building it, yeah.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.858 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: So building it.

00:38:35.858 --> 00:38:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And because you've got all
these 10-1s and the nines

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.880 align:middle line:84%
is the power to
actually do that.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.760 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the reason
you could break through.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if you didn't have
this sort of level of power,

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't have let you
through the glass ceiling.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:46.808 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have
broken the glass.

00:38:46.808 --> 00:38:48.090 align:middle line:90%
Not possible.

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't
try to break it.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.209 align:middle line:84%
It worked out that
way, it seems.

00:38:51.209 --> 00:38:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.800 align:middle line:84%
You've just sort of naturally
gone through anyway.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And the eights here in spiritual
karma are about coming to Earth

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.080 align:middle line:90%
and grounding your mission.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So making what you do grounded
and accessible to people

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.510 align:middle line:90%
by first grounding yourself.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And the soul destiny,
the 14-5s is what we call

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:90%
reflected being.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.875 align:middle line:84%
And that is essentially
about reflecting back

00:39:14.875 --> 00:39:17.520 align:middle line:84%
to others parts of
themselves they haven't seen,

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.970 align:middle line:84%
which is what you
do with this show.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Just from the response
we got from the first two

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.790 align:middle line:84%
shows, people thinking,
I'm glad someone said that.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Or no one's ever said
that, ever, on TV.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And you really reached-- this
show-- you both really reached

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:90%
me with what you were talking.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's mirroring to people all
the hidden parts of themselves

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.571 align:middle line:90%
that they can't access.

00:39:38.571 --> 00:39:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
a soul destiny.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:40.611 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And the 5's-- that's the 14.

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And the 5's about
being the pioneer.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.826 align:middle line:84%
This is why you do the new
stuff, and the new cutting edge

00:39:45.826 --> 00:39:49.250 align:middle line:84%
stuff, as much as you're
allowed to within the parameters

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:50.910 align:middle line:90%
of the show.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And so for Stewart,
his chart-- see, look.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.490 align:middle line:84%
He has these 11-2s
in column three,

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.330 align:middle line:84%
in physical karma
and spiritual karma.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.095 align:middle line:90%
So was he lost as a child?

00:40:02.095 --> 00:40:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lost?

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.761 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Did he feel lost?

00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: About being on Earth.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Didn't understand-- well,
how does this work, Mom?

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:07.840 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.797 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:40:08.797 --> 00:40:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know
that at the time,

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.870 align:middle line:84%
but that was revealed
well into adulthood.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.932 align:middle line:84%
It was just kind of
confusing to him.

00:40:15.932 --> 00:40:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So with a child like
that, it's a bit like Gabriel,

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.636 align:middle line:84%
except he's got two
of them, you need

00:40:20.636 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:90%
to give them lots of structure.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.974 align:middle line:84%
So you give a child
structure, and you walk away.

00:40:24.974 --> 00:40:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And you give them
time to assimilate it.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.210 align:middle line:84%
It may not look like
they're assimilating it,

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:31.130 align:middle line:84%
but actually it's
going in slow motion,

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:33.680 align:middle line:84%
like through a sort of slow
motion sponge, until he feels

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.216 align:middle line:90%
whatever you shared with him.

00:40:35.216 --> 00:40:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And that assimilates, and
they come back to you,

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.770 align:middle line:90%
OK, I've got it.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.310 align:middle line:90%
That's because they need time.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.927 align:middle line:84%
Or if they don't get, you give
it to them a different way.

00:40:43.927 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, after two
or three different ways,

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.880 align:middle line:90%
that would have got it.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Because he's here to be
a builder of knowledge.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: What does
he actually do?

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: His degree
is in philosophy.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And I would say he's-- if you
look at it from a reincarnation

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:84%
point of view, he would
certainly be a dead Greek.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.410 align:middle line:84%
He was born a philosopher from
the time he was very little.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:84%
He just understands the
larger themes of life

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.806 align:middle line:84%
and can articulate
them very well.

00:41:08.806 --> 00:41:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, that's
the 11-2, building

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:12.070 align:middle line:90%
a structure of knowledge.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is all about
assimilating lots of knowledge,

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.650 align:middle line:84%
or being exposed to lots
of knowledge and concepts

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.797 align:middle line:84%
and saying, well,
what's true for me?

00:41:20.797 --> 00:41:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, with that he
decided he wanted

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:26.790 align:middle line:84%
to use that aspect of himself in
the world of theater and arts.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And so after doing
a couple businesses

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and realizing making money
for the sake of making money

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:36.020 align:middle line:84%
was just no joy at all,
he went back into theater

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and now he's moving on
that path full time.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:41.360 align:middle line:84%
He's written a
couple screenplays

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.166 align:middle line:84%
and wants to express those
higher themes through art.

00:41:45.166 --> 00:41:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The artist, the
communicator, is a three.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.280 align:middle line:84%
The 12-3 in spiritual
talents in column three.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.470 align:middle line:90%
And 12-3 in soul destiny.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:57.249 align:middle line:84%
So he's bringing out deep soul
wisdom through performance.

00:41:57.249 --> 00:41:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:58.979 align:middle line:90%
So he's aligned with that.

00:41:58.979 --> 00:41:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Threes are always writers,
singers, performers, artists

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.410 align:middle line:90%
communicators of some sort.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's about absorbing
lots of knowledge

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and synthesizing it into
a higher, expanded form

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.980 align:middle line:90%
to take it out to the world.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd say
that's his goal, yeah.

00:42:16.025 --> 00:42:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And the
money thing comes

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.649 align:middle line:84%
from the threes, which is
exploring wealth and poverty

00:42:19.649 --> 00:42:21.769 align:middle line:90%
consciousness emotionally.

00:42:21.769 --> 00:42:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And so initially
there's the feeling,

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.450 align:middle line:84%
I've got to make lots
of money, which would

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:25.574 align:middle line:90%
have driven that initially.

00:42:25.574 --> 00:42:27.295 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you
live in North America.

00:42:27.295 --> 00:42:31.116 align:middle line:84%
But then it's like,
well, now I've got it.

00:42:31.116 --> 00:42:33.020 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
more to it than this.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's more about bringing
the emotional wealth

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.390 align:middle line:84%
of the soul and its
deep wisdom up and out

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.415 align:middle line:90%
of the canal of that three.

00:42:40.415 --> 00:42:42.540 align:middle line:84%
It's an internal canal--
it's like a secret library

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.980 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge-- out into
the world to be shared

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.720 align:middle line:90%
and to manifest form.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like
he's doing that.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And the 14-5 in physical
talents is all about

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.990 align:middle line:84%
showing people who they are
through his gift of his art.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.470 align:middle line:90%
That's reflecting back to them.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The reflecting
thing again, yeah.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.024 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Do you see
this about society?

00:43:03.024 --> 00:43:05.356 align:middle line:84%
Because people are so busy
just trying to earn a living,

00:43:05.356 --> 00:43:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and often just surviving
and functioning.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, actually,
that's interesting.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.797 align:middle line:84%
I never thought
about it that way.

00:43:10.797 --> 00:43:12.380 align:middle line:84%
That's actually quite
a serious issue.

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So it gets them
thinking about stuff.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He does that a lot,
among his friends and such.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Intense
mirroring that goes on.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.144 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:19.144 --> 00:43:22.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's interesting,
just because of what

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:84%
you talked about in your
chart and Gabriel's,

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and the whole notion of
structure and the 11-2--

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, OK, his father and
I divorced when he was young.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So that took a certain
amount of structure away.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And then he did go to
the Waldorf School,

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:84%
because he was very much
into the arts and exploring,

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and had no interest-- was
very dyslexic-- no interest

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.800 align:middle line:84%
in reading and all
that until later.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it seemed the
Waldorf part worked,

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:52.880 align:middle line:84%
but I'm wondering, now,
how having a divorce when

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.600 align:middle line:84%
the child is young would have
affected that whole structure

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.100 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: How old was he?

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was only four.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:43:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: OK.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.945 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a
divorce number here.

00:44:00.945 --> 00:44:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the 10-1.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it is?

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:04.176 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: In physical
goals, column three.

00:44:04.176 --> 00:44:07.040 align:middle line:90%
I call it the divorce number.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.899 align:middle line:90%
Gabriel's got one.

00:44:07.899 --> 00:44:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's always
a higher proportion

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.015 align:middle line:84%
of kids who have the 10-1s--
their parents get divorced.

00:44:13.015 --> 00:44:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:90%
10-1 is the divorce number.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It's the divorce number.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
was in his being?

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:19.755 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he--

00:44:19.755 --> 00:44:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: He knew this
was going to happen.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:22.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He knew this before--
well, he would have, yes.

00:44:22.695 --> 00:44:23.195 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:23.195 --> 00:44:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So the reason for it
is because the 10-1 in a karmic

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.380 align:middle line:84%
or goal position
is about learning

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.620 align:middle line:84%
to bring the male and
female aspects of God

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.450 align:middle line:90%
within us into balance.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So mother and father
represent the archetypes,

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.890 align:middle line:84%
the ego, of mother,
father, God, and how

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.470 align:middle line:84%
we separate in consciousness
with our ego from that pipe,

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.010 align:middle line:90%
coming into a body.

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So the literal,
physical separation

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.970 align:middle line:84%
was a disconnect for
him at an ego level--

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:90%
mother, father, God.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:53.185 align:middle line:84%
So his job is to basically
reunite them together

00:44:53.185 --> 00:44:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and find peace and
bring them together

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.490 align:middle line:90%
so they find their new balance.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And his whole life will be about
trying to find that balance.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually the gift that
the divorce of you and his dad

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.650 align:middle line:90%
gives him.

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily a
disaster, as most people think,

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.070 align:middle line:90%
a failure.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:10.804 align:middle line:90%
It's actually what he needed.

00:45:10.804 --> 00:45:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I kind
of gathered that.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Because that was in the
stars from the beginning.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as though
we came together just

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:84%
to bring him through
into the world.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So that's the
gift a child gives.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And so in resolving
that and unifying that,

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.275 align:middle line:90%
he comes full circle.

00:45:29.275 --> 00:45:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And because he's been through
that visceral experience

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.530 align:middle line:84%
of re-unifying the two, he
has a deep understanding,

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.030 align:middle line:84%
deep feeling of
what that is like.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he can embody that
mother, father, God energy,

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that channelled energy,
to be of pure service.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:84%
That's actually why the
money got boring, as well.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Because a 10-1 is I want
to serve at the highest

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:49.284 align:middle line:90%
level with my gifts.

00:45:49.284 --> 00:45:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Which is
what he's doing now.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.014 align:middle line:90%
How old is he now?

00:45:52.014 --> 00:45:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's now 32.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.510 align:middle line:84%
OK So he's really
coming online now.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:57.759 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he's just
starting to say, this is it,

00:45:57.759 --> 00:45:59.780 align:middle line:84%
this is my path, I'm
going for it, here.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.279 align:middle line:90%
The other didn't work for me.

00:46:01.279 --> 00:46:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So I'm passionate
about being of service.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if service is ahead of
making money in someone's life,

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're passionate about
it, the money flows anyway.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's something which
is a known principle.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.300 align:middle line:84%
There have been studies that
businesses, for example, that

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.220 align:middle line:84%
focus on the bottom line make
less money than businesses that

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:24.550 align:middle line:84%
focus on service to internal
customers, the staff,

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and external customers,
suppliers and clients.

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So when we follow
our passion in life,

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:35.260 align:middle line:84%
when we have the
privilege or the luck,

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.340 align:middle line:84%
whatever, or the gift of being
able to follow our passion,

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.652 align:middle line:90%
then life flows anyway.

00:46:39.652 --> 00:46:40.860 align:middle line:90%
It will all flow financially.

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.757 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Because so
many people think,

00:46:43.757 --> 00:46:45.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, I've now got a big mortgage.

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Say you live in California--
you've got a huge mortgage.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:47.800 align:middle line:90%
I've just got to pay the bills.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But I'm probably
going to suffer.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.943 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
most of us do, though.

00:46:50.943 --> 00:46:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most human beings
do make that compromise

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.320 align:middle line:90%
to stay alive.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.375 align:middle line:84%
But the actual-- it's
making that transition out

00:46:57.375 --> 00:46:59.950 align:middle line:84%
of the fear of the
ego around the money

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.760 align:middle line:90%
to flowing with our gift.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And we flow with our
gift just like my friend,

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.720 align:middle line:84%
she's flowing more with what
she wants to do-- the finances

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.562 align:middle line:90%
flow anyway.

00:47:09.562 --> 00:47:11.145 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like
he's doing it early.

00:47:11.145 --> 00:47:13.285 align:middle line:90%
So he's got off to a good start.

00:47:13.285 --> 00:47:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he found
out the painful way.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Business for business' sake
didn't work for him at all.

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:21.404 align:middle line:90%


00:47:21.404 --> 00:47:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So he's really had to be
a master communicator, teacher.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And the 8s, which is a 3 in
spiritual talents and soul

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.680 align:middle line:90%
destiny.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual goals are
an eight, the little amoeba

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:32.570 align:middle line:90%
symbol.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So he's here to actuall land
here, ground into his body,

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.860 align:middle line:84%
get clear emotional
boundaries, and then

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.679 align:middle line:84%
to reach out to people
over those bounds,

00:47:41.679 --> 00:47:43.845 align:middle line:84%
but knowing where his issues
are and where they are.

00:47:43.845 --> 00:47:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But he's here to ground
his gift of the 12-3s,

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.676 align:middle line:84%
to ground the deep wisdom
and knowledge to the world.

00:47:50.676 --> 00:47:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing
is all about putting

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.930 align:middle line:84%
a structure of knowledge,
philosophy, OK.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:57.759 align:middle line:90%
Being of service with a 10-1.

00:47:57.759 --> 00:48:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Then communicating that in
a grounded way to the world.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.550 align:middle line:90%
That's his purpose.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are there are
any clashy things here?

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah,
looking for that now.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:07.740 align:middle line:90%
You guys have no clashes.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.720 align:middle line:90%
So you were organized.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
have any clashes.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm his biggest fan,
and he's my biggest fan,

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's just kind
of been that way.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So that would-- this chart
would certainly indicate that.

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: There's a
nice karmic lock

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.890 align:middle line:84%
here in your physical
talent, 11-2, in column one.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Because across to his talent
gateway with a 14-5, up to his

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.494 align:middle line:84%
11-2 in spiritual
and physical karma.

00:48:31.494 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So you're the one
here to give him

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:37.280 align:middle line:84%
lots of structure for working
out in the physical world.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.975 align:middle line:84%
So whenever he gets
lost, the best thing

00:48:39.975 --> 00:48:41.240 align:middle line:90%
is for him to come to see you.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.862 align:middle line:84%
And he'll just
hang out with you,

00:48:42.862 --> 00:48:44.320 align:middle line:84%
or be on Skype, or
whatever it is--

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so funny.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.055 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly how it goes
when he's feeling a little--

00:48:47.055 --> 00:48:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: What do I do?

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: He'll just sit with it.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.340 align:middle line:90%
And he'll get it after a while.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell
him consciously,

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.510 align:middle line:90%
or just by being in your field.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.800 align:middle line:84%
It'll be like, oh,
I'm getting it now.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:90%
I know what to do.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the key thing.

00:48:58.820 --> 00:48:59.620 align:middle line:90%
That's actually--

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:02.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's exactly
our relationship.

00:49:02.345 --> 00:49:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: And let's see what else.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.680 align:middle line:84%
The nines here in
physical goals,

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.140 align:middle line:84%
that goes across to your--
your physical goal, column one,

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.720 align:middle line:84%
goes to his 10 1
in column three.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And what that does
is that catalyzes

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:17.970 align:middle line:84%
him to really come into his
service, come into his power.

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:21.820 align:middle line:84%
How is his expression
of his masculine energy?

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's really nicely
balanced between the two.

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.340 align:middle line:90%
He has a lot of male friends.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.885 align:middle line:84%
And he's not, like,
uber sporting, though he

00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:32.240 align:middle line:90%
was very good at sports.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.970 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't his--
he was a musician.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.880 align:middle line:90%
He is a musician, also.

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So he's-- I'd say he's a
really nice balance between--

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.930 align:middle line:84%
he has a lot of male friends,
a lot of female friends.

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So you're the catalyst
for him to keep balancing.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.404 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:45.404 --> 00:49:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: They don't
actually do it.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So he's out of balance,
hang out with you for a bit,

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.345 align:middle line:84%
and it'll sort of
shift the energy.

00:49:50.345 --> 00:49:52.680 align:middle line:84%
The nine will
penetrated that 10-1.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Then it'll got to
the next level of--

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.048 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I noticed
that if he gets

00:49:56.048 --> 00:49:59.660 align:middle line:84%
lost in the feminine energy,
with a girlfriend or whatever,

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.990 align:middle line:84%
with just too much time and the
energy he starts-- his energy

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.880 align:middle line:84%
will dissipate in terms
of his focus in life.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And he has to be always looking
to balance that, I noticed.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other thing
about balance is the two.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:17.152 align:middle line:84%
The two is about being
up and down emotionally.

00:50:17.152 --> 00:50:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
are these over here?

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:23.575 align:middle line:84%
As his name that he goes
by-- these are 22-4s, 22-4s.

00:50:23.575 --> 00:50:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen that one yet.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.570 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, the
22-4s there are

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.279 align:middle line:84%
about-- that's the
blending-- the symbol of 22

00:50:30.279 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:84%
is a circle, which is the
blending of mind, body,

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:32.819 align:middle line:90%
and soul.

00:50:32.819 --> 00:50:34.847 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually
accessing source.

00:50:34.847 --> 00:50:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually
showing his true colors.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So what he's showing you is
that a large component from me

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:40.770 align:middle line:90%
comes fro source.

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:44.680 align:middle line:84%
It's come here to share
the knowledge of source,

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and experience of
the soul which is

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.410 align:middle line:84%
a four, which is about sharing
knowledge, ideas, money,

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:50.470 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:52.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's actually the source.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Is he very versatile?

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, very.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:56.656 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So this means
he can pretty much

00:50:56.656 --> 00:50:58.360 align:middle line:90%
do anything he likes down here.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And the 19-1 in
physical talents is

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.365 align:middle line:84%
about him holding
space for others

00:51:03.365 --> 00:51:04.990 align:middle line:84%
to learn about and
achieve their goals.

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:06.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's the theater.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, literally.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Literally it's a theater.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Of here.

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And the 18-9 in
spiritual talents

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:16.030 align:middle line:84%
is having the power of the nine
to make the hard decisions,

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:17.770 align:middle line:84%
to follow spirit,
which is the 18.

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Shall I follow the
flow of spirit or not?

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So he's good at managing
projects, I'd say.

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, he is.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, it
sounds like all these have

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:30.490 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of flavor
to them, that it's

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:34.070 align:middle line:84%
to take information, source,
and flow it through, and ground

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:34.904 align:middle line:90%
it, and share it.

00:51:34.904 --> 00:51:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, in
this case, that's

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.445 align:middle line:90%
the way his chart is built.

00:51:37.445 --> 00:51:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It's all about knowledge,
hold space, deliver.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.840 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
is all about that.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:49.490 align:middle line:84%
He does have an 11-2, again, in
physical karma in the overlay.

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:50.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's not karmic.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.526 align:middle line:84%
It's just a pure frequency,
just to be clear on what

00:51:52.526 --> 00:51:53.610 align:middle line:90%
happens in an overlay.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.901 align:middle line:84%
That's actually going into
his 11-2 in his birth chart.

00:51:55.901 --> 00:51:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So actually that
name is actually

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.930 align:middle line:90%
throwing off balance at times.

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So emotionally he may
be very up and down.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Is he very impulsive?

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He more vacillates.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Like a libran quality.

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:09.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of libra
there, where he'll

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:12.360 align:middle line:84%
go back and forth on something,
trying to use his head

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.280 align:middle line:84%
to figure it out rather than
that just kind of knowingness

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.930 align:middle line:84%
that some people have, or--
I know what it is, I'm going.

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:19.471 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, he's
on the two spring,

00:52:19.471 --> 00:52:20.760 align:middle line:90%
so he's going up and down.

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.952 align:middle line:84%
And so his perception of
the truth of a situation

00:52:22.952 --> 00:52:24.410 align:middle line:84%
is changing in the
moment, which is

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:26.840 align:middle line:90%
why it's really unclear to him.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.715 align:middle line:84%
So it's wisdom
and foolishness is

00:52:28.715 --> 00:52:30.179 align:middle line:90%
the polarity he's playing with.

00:52:30.179 --> 00:52:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's wisdom and what?

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:32.761 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Wisdom and foolishness.

00:52:32.761 --> 00:52:35.360 align:middle line:84%
He's moving between the
two polarities of wisdom

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and foolishness by-- he can't
tell the truth of a situation,

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:42.170 align:middle line:84%
so what he's got to do is
wait until the spring settles.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And when he sees or feels
the truth of a situation,

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.140 align:middle line:90%
it's consistent.

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.800 align:middle line:84%
It might take days, weeks,
or months, or years.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.306 align:middle line:84%
If he act on that, then he will
act from a place of wisdom.

00:52:55.306 --> 00:52:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And then he'll make
the right decision.

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:59.550 align:middle line:84%
If he acts impulsively by saying
something or doing something

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.110 align:middle line:84%
while he's still
moving, then that

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:04.160 align:middle line:84%
will be a foolish decision
which he will regret,

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.724 align:middle line:84%
but he would learn
wisdom from that.

00:53:05.724 --> 00:53:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So initially he
can be very impulsive.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.410 align:middle line:90%
He was very impulsive initially.

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But eventually they
learn with us to wait.

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Wait longer than is
comfortable, then

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.470 align:middle line:90%
a wise decision will be made.

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.618 align:middle line:84%
He was more like that,
even when he was little.

00:53:21.618 --> 00:53:23.220 align:middle line:84%
He never asked for
a lot of things.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.200 align:middle line:84%
He'd kind of wait and say, well,
for my birthday or Christmas--

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.380 align:middle line:84%
even when he was three-- he
wasn't-- he never even asked

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.200 align:middle line:84%
for anything in
an impulsive way.

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.660 align:middle line:84%
It was-- he thought
about it a lot.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And then decided,
well, for Christmas,

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.052 align:middle line:90%
I would like this this year.

00:53:36.052 --> 00:53:37.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: So he's got it.

00:53:37.095 --> 00:53:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And the last number's
a 14-5 in column four,

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.450 align:middle line:90%
spiritual goals.

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's all about
creating intensity in life.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:49.590 align:middle line:84%
He already has intensity
with a 14-5 in column three,

00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:50.780 align:middle line:90%
in physical talents.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.679 align:middle line:84%
So-- is he very
intense to be around?

00:53:52.679 --> 00:53:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:54.970 align:middle line:90%
He can be pretty intense.

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:58.067 align:middle line:84%
He's laid back and fun, but he's
also-- when he's on something,

00:53:58.067 --> 00:53:58.900 align:middle line:90%
he's really intense.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:53:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Really on it?

00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:03.180 align:middle line:84%
If you get into a discussion
with him, it's like, whoa.

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.280 align:middle line:90%
It's coming right at you.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, the
intensity is because he

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.840 align:middle line:90%
grows from intensity.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.876 align:middle line:84%
Breaking through patterns,
have that intensity.

00:54:11.876 --> 00:54:15.260 align:middle line:84%
But the key with a child
with a 14-5-- or a man,

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:19.280 align:middle line:84%
in this case, a
son-- is to pace it.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.117 align:middle line:84%
Because most people can't
handle that level of intensity.

00:54:22.117 --> 00:54:22.700 align:middle line:90%
14-5s love it.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.620 align:middle line:84%
They say, bring it on,
give me more intensity.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.285 align:middle line:84%
Most people say, oh, I'm
turning into a puddle with this.

00:54:27.285 --> 00:54:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:28.576 align:middle line:90%
I'm burning out.

00:54:28.576 --> 00:54:29.077 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:29.077 --> 00:54:30.867 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So you say,
OK, let's take a break.

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's take five.

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:32.390 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll come back.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:33.306 align:middle line:90%
And they go, you what?

00:54:33.306 --> 00:54:34.095 align:middle line:90%
You want a break?

00:54:34.095 --> 00:54:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I need a break.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And so you manage it.

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back,
and you can cope then.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:40.051 align:middle line:84%
And then he still
gets what he needs.

00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But you're not
getting melted by it.

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Is there any-- we only have
just a couple minutes left here.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Goodness, this went by quickly.

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:50.890 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about a lot
in the foundational part

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:53.679 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation, and looking
at this-- any final statements

00:54:53.679 --> 00:54:55.470 align:middle line:84%
you want to make in
the next couple minutes

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:58.930 align:middle line:84%
about the value of
knowing our child

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:01.180 align:middle line:90%
on this conscious a level?

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, I think the key
thing is to consciously flow

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and hold a known space
by using the soul

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:13.340 align:middle line:84%
contract of the child as a
spiritual map of their life

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.597 align:middle line:84%
in each moment, and
being aware of why

00:55:15.597 --> 00:55:17.680 align:middle line:84%
they're doing certain
things, what's driving them.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And then being there to hold
a space so that, as they take

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:21.990 align:middle line:84%
their next step, rather
than them stepping off

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:23.864 align:middle line:84%
into the void, trying
something and thinking,

00:55:23.864 --> 00:55:26.549 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, what's going on here?

00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's the key thing,
so the child feels safe,

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.140 align:middle line:84%
so they actually feel
safe to explore the world

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.535 align:middle line:90%
and create their life.

00:55:33.535 --> 00:55:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you say,
don't squish the life force out

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.970 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Don't make their eyes go dull.

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:43.090 align:middle line:10%
And the thing with it is it's
actually about their agenda,

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:46.430 align:middle line:10%
what they want to do, not what
we as parents want them to do.

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:50.140 align:middle line:10%
Because always easy to
try and live through them.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:51.890 align:middle line:84%
It's about letting
them be in their truth,

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.430 align:middle line:84%
supporting them
in that, and they

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:55.700 align:middle line:84%
know that they're
supported and loved

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.010 align:middle line:84%
before they're going to
flower and give the gift.

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And the clearer their
eyes are, the more

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.165 align:middle line:84%
the higher consciousness
part of them

00:56:01.165 --> 00:56:02.539 align:middle line:84%
is going to come
through and just

00:56:02.539 --> 00:56:04.880 align:middle line:84%
keep transforming and
raising the consciousness

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.390 align:middle line:84%
of Earth, which is why they
came in the first place.

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:10.014 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's very
beautifully said.

00:56:10.014 --> 00:56:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
sharing all this

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:13.660 align:middle line:84%
so people can see in
a kind of detailed way

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:17.530 align:middle line:84%
how these aspects reflect
off of each other, as well.

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So, until next time,
whenever that may be,

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:23.320 align:middle line:84%
think you so much for taking
the time to explain this to us.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.694 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Thank you for having
me on the show again Regina.

00:56:25.694 --> 00:56:26.840 align:middle line:90%
It's been a real pleasure.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, you can find
Nicolas's work and his book

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.960 align:middle line:10%

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:59.925 align:middle line:90%
