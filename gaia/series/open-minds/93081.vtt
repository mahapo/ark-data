00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Neil Kramer,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:10%
we spoke about how
empires are formed

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.090 align:middle line:10%
through our own
lack of direction.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Today we'll speak
about reestablishing

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:84%
our own authority
in the world while

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
still under the influence of
empire, one step at a time.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.300 align:middle line:10%
It's so good to
have you back, Neil.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:10%
That was a great
last conversation.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.359 align:middle line:10%
I loved it.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:10%
And I think most people
watching this are already

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.512 align:middle line:10%
primed from that one.

00:00:48.512 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:10%
There will be a
couple things we'll

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:10%
kind of touch on and expand on.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.457 align:middle line:10%
But first of all, we're
told to give our power away.

00:00:55.457 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:10%
Let's just start
with that right there

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:10%
before we go into
how to reclaim it.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.019 align:middle line:10%
We're told from every
established viewpoint,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:10%
from every agency, from
every family pattern,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.684 align:middle line:10%
to give our authority
away in life.

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:10%
That's how we start in the
world, for the most part.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.857 align:middle line:10%
For 98% of us, maybe 99.9%.

00:01:14.857 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NEIL KRAMER: Absolutely.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.356 align:middle line:10%
And particularly
in Britain, where

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:10%
we have a
constitutional monarchy.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:10%
Since I was a child we were
taught that the queen is

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:10%
the boss and the government
do the administration.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:10%
But this lady has
to sign it off.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:10%
And that's instilled into
lots of young people.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:10%
Of course that changes,
but it gives you

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:10%
the wording of being a subject.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:10%
A subject of the
British empire, which

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:10%
is still wording
that exists today.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:10%
And it didn't strike, you
know, the young Neil Kramer

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:10%
until he was 18 or whatever
to think, subject to what?

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Subject to what empire?

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's ironic, the
wording, isn't it?

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:84%
In light of the conversation
we're having, to say, would

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I like to consider myself
as the subject of an empire?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, not really.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:10%
And one thing we didn't talk
about in our last conversation

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.268 align:middle line:10%
that I had wanted to get to,
because you've just brought it

00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:10%
up, and you were talking
about England specifically,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:10%
is this notion of having
given up our sovereignty.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:10%
One of the best examples of
that is the CCTV cameras.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I've been shocked.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:90%
They're even on the trains.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
There isn't-- my understanding,
there isn't a block of London

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have
these, essentially,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.121 align:middle line:90%
surveillance cameras, on it.

00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you're walking
down the street

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and doing normal transaction,
seeing your family,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.880 align:middle line:84%
your friends,
whatever you're doing,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:84%
you're on camera if
you're not in your home.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And this has had-- I mean, to
me, that's just horrifying.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
What kind of effect is
it having on the Brits?

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:10%
Although they've been told
to surrender to the empire,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:10%
is it a little
different mentality?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: I would say
anybody 40 and above will

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.607 align:middle line:10%
find it horrifying and
say, what on earth is

00:02:58.607 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:10%
happening to this country?

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a disgrace.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:90%
And it is a disgrace.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of younger
people, they've

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
grown up with the cameras,
and that's part of the deal.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
To say, they've been used
to cameras in school.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
They've been used to cameras
on the freeways, motorways,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
the streets, the street corner,
the hospital, the trains,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:90%
The taxi cabs, everywhere.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
young people now,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
who are 10, 20, 30 years
old, have grown up with that.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.495 align:middle line:84%
So they've been acclimatized to
it, which I think is the game.

00:03:29.495 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
about the cameras

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:84%
is that initially
it was to say, OK,

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
we're going to keep
up tabs on people

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
so if some violent incident
occurs, some old lady's mugged,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:90%
we can catch the perpetrator.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.197 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that
happy for everybody?

00:03:43.197 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
You've got nothing to
be afraid of if you're

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.863 align:middle line:90%
doing nothing wrong.

00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's
the catch, isn't it?

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Right?

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.122 align:middle line:10%
And to the uninitiated,
that sounds reasonable.

00:03:53.122 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:10%
It sounds like common sense.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.026 align:middle line:10%
If you've not done
anything wrong,

00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:10%
you've got nothing
to be afraid of.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:10%
This lady, Theresa May,
says that all the time

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.370 align:middle line:10%
in British politics.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:10%
The reality is,
when you understand,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:10%
for viewers who have to listened
to our previous conversations,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:10%
what empire is, which is
this ethos of manipulation

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:10%
to limit human
beings' growth, you

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:10%
can't afford to say that you're
doing nothing wrong anymore.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:10%
For me, I'm not
doing anything wrong.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:10%
But the actions
I participate in,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:10%
which require sovereign
spirit and sovereign movement

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:10%
of my deeds and
thoughts in the world,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:10%
are antagonistic to empire.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:90%
So my very being opposes empire.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So I am doing something wrong
from their point of view.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So the cameras would
take a special look

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
at somebody like me, and there's
millions of people like me.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And the software behind
some of the cameras

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
now is actually looking
at behavioral movement

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
of the people to see how
you stand, how you sit,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:90%
how you move.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.156 align:middle line:84%
And it's not long, and I
expect in some laboratories

00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
or whatever somewhere,
they're doing this now,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:middle line:84%
where your actual
thoughts that give off

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:84%
this electromagnetic
pulse can be seen.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:10%
Whether you're using
the part of your brain

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:10%
that some people call the
default mode network, which

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:10%
is all the kind of routine
programming of empire,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:10%
or the task positive
network, which

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:10%
is your momentary spiritual
awareness, you might say.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:10%
That's a little bit
of a crude summation.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:10%
But you get the idea.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:10%
You could measure--
you can physically

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:10%
do this with the technology
now, which parts of the brain

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.599 align:middle line:10%
are being activated.

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:10%
At the moment, you have to put
the little things on the head.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:10%
But I bet you can do
it from a distance.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:10%
And if that was the case,
they could measure people,

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:10%
and see them, who are
thinking differently.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:10%
And aside from just the invasion
of privacy, like you said,

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:10%
it's-- and we're going to
talk about culture in a moment

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.470 align:middle line:10%
and regaining sovereignty amidst
the popular culture at large,

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:10%
but this, the fact that the
younger people are actually

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.480 align:middle line:10%
acquiescent to it now is, to me,
one of the most dangerous signs

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:10%
for what our future could hold.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:10%
Because now people have
been taught to truly

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.070 align:middle line:10%
give away all
sovereignty, all privacy.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they have speakers
on a lot of these CCTV stands

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:10%
with the cameras that
someone, whoever's

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:10%
behind the curtain,
who's watching

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:10%
that neighborhood
and all the cameras,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:10%
sees someone littering.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:10%
And I've seen this.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:10%
I've actually seen this.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:10%
The video was released.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:10%
You have a voice saying,
sir in the red jacket,

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:10%
please pick up that item you
just put on the sidewalk.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:10%
Oh my god.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:10%
This is way worse than
any Big Brother scenario

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:10%
we've ever dreamed of.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: You know, a friend--

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What does
this do to our future?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: A friend-- what
does it do to our future.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.078 align:middle line:90%
I'll answer that in a moment.

00:06:47.078 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:10%
A friend sent me some dialogue
from George Orwell's novel,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.400 align:middle line:10%
"1984," and it's
not funny anymore,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:10%
because it's actually
transpired now.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.462 align:middle line:10%
It's already happened.

00:06:58.462 --> 00:07:00.170 align:middle line:10%
We're not talking
about, oh, we're close.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:10%
It's already happened.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:10%
We were talking
specifically, for example,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:10%
about in 1828, when Noah
Webster wrote this marvelous

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:10%
American Dictionary,
he had the word

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:10%
in there, "discriminate,"
which meant

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:10%
to determine the quality of
the thing from good or bad,

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:10%
from excellent or poor.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was a mark of
classification based on merit.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And now, the same Merriam
Webster Dictionary,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
as it is now, the
very primary meaning

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.680 align:middle line:84%
of the word "discrimination" is
to unfairly separate one group

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
or individual or
idea from another.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Unfairly.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:90%
That's a new thing.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing unfair
in discrimination.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
That's a moral installation
in the program of thinking

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that's put forward
to new people.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:10%
So the word "discrimination," in
the last 160 years or whatever,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:10%
has become a different word now.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:10%
And that's an
element of control.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:10%
I will say this, though,
about young people.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.829 align:middle line:10%
They're being asked to give
away their self authority.

00:08:03.829 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:10%
And they're being asked
to do silly things,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:10%
and they're being asked to
participate in a society

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:10%
where privacy is gone.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:10%
But not all of them are
acquiescing to that.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:10%
Not all of them.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:10%
And last week, I met these
two wonderful young women

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:10%
from Seattle, 22
and 24 they were.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were really super
powerful, profound warrior

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle line:90%
princesses.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
delightful to see

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
how they completely saw through
the little anemic smokescreen

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:84%
of empire and thought, we love
coming to this event with you

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Neil Kramer, because you make
us realize that, A, we're not

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:10%
B, we're doing
something of honor

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:10%
and of-- using our privilege
of freedom and power.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing
something that matters.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And from time to time, we have
to gather together to do that.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to have a
speaker or a writer or anything

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:10%
with you, but just to come
together and examine the system

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:10%
and let off steam and
to make jokes about it.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And to remember that
real human culture

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:84%
is something that the
mainstream media doesn't really

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:90%
have a talk about.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And that they were
very aware of that.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And they could have been my
bloody daughters, you know,

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:90%
that's how young they were.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.887 align:middle line:10%
And it was very
encouraging to see that.

00:09:18.887 --> 00:09:19.803 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, it is.

00:09:19.803 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:10%
I've just been reading a book
called "The Phoenix Generation"

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.990 align:middle line:10%
by Kingsley Dennis.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:10%
And he's saying that
that generation, which

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:10%
will-- they'll
become solidly of age

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:10%
in 2030, the group
he's talking about.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:84%
That they-- inner authority
will be their way of living.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they
will be not just accustomed to,

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:84%
but actually rely
upon, transparency.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, I bring
these cameras up,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
because here we have it as
an invasion from the way

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:90%
we were raised.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:84%
As you say, anyone
over 40, this is

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:90%
just horrific, what's happened.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:10%
But to the younger
people, they've

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.760 align:middle line:10%
been acculturated to it.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:10%
So that's one thing.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:10%
They understand, that's
just how life is now.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:10%
But is there something
in that mix, subtly,

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:10%
that has to do with
transparency, that

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.614 align:middle line:10%
will be desirable in regaining
our authority and autonomy?

00:10:11.614 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That's
a great question.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.904 align:middle line:84%
I know people say that,
but I really mean it.

00:10:14.904 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
There is an element in
it where the contents

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:84%
of our lives and
our hearts and minds

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
get spilled out on the
table for everybody to see.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting thing,
where you can consider it

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
as a precursor to a state
of, like, mass telepathy

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:84%
amongst humankind,
which I've spoken

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:90%
about at previous things.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:84%
You have to console and
consider the fact that,

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
are you prepared to have all
your cards face up like that?

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
exactly right, yeah.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And my question
is, when I go to the airport,

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.093 align:middle line:10%
I always willfully get into that
scanner and go, eh, scan me.

00:10:55.093 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm a sovereign being.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:10%
I've got nothing to worry about.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.172 align:middle line:10%
You want to check through
my pockets, that's fine.

00:10:59.172 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:10%
Here, I'll take my shoes off.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:10%
Do you want to see my
hairy toes, as well?

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't mind, right?

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't mind that.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:84%
You want to surveil
me, here I am.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Surveil me.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't mind.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.482 align:middle line:90%
I've got nothing to worry about.

00:11:08.482 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But not because I've
done anything wrong,

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:90%
because I know who I am.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's no
authority above me, you see.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:90%
That's the key difference.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get that, if
you don't acknowledge it--

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't quite use
the word believe,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't get it, if you
don't grock it, as they say,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
then you subject yourself to
the power of surveillance.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're actually physically
giving your light away.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.339 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're,
again, a subject.

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: You become a subject.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.500 align:middle line:10%
You subject yourself to another.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:10%
You become subject
to a process that you

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:10%
don't have any control over.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:10%
That's always a choice.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's the key
thing in all our conversations

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:10%
That's always a choice.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't occur
to people, that,

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:10%
until they're already
embroiled in it

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:10%
and hopelessly entangled in it.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.464 align:middle line:84%
And there's always a possibility
that you can make that nice.

00:12:01.464 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:90%
You can smooth it out.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
You can learn the
lesson and resolve it.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
for us now,

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:84%
in our middle life,
in the middle part

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of our process of maturation,
but also for the young people

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
to say, be conscious about the
things that you consent to.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:10%
And be conscious who's
asking you to do something.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Gauge the wisdom of the person
who asks for your consent.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:84%
If it's somebody in
their cell phone shop,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
if it's a government
official, if it's a policeman,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:84%
if it's a fireman, if it's
a high school principal,

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:84%
gauge the wisdom
of that individual.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.970 align:middle line:10%
And as we said in our
last conversation,

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:10%
the state trooper that I was
with was quite a wise man,

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:10%
not just because the let
me off my speeding ticket,

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.062 align:middle line:10%
but because we had
a conversation.

00:12:44.062 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:10%
And he said, you
know what, you are

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:10%
going a little bit too fast.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.804 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I know.

00:12:47.804 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:10%
I said, I am going too fast.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:10%
15 miles over.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:10%
It's 55, I was doing 70.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:10%
That's a clear ticket.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.492 align:middle line:10%
I said, you know what, I
am going to change that,

00:12:55.492 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:10%
because there's deers that
run out here all the time,

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.870 align:middle line:10%
and it could just be nasty.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:10%
And he said, honestly, he said,
please drive more carefully.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:10%
And I looked at him right
in the eye, and I said,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:10%
you know what, I actually will.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:90%
I will do that.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And I really looked at
him, and he believed me.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And then he went away and
said, drive more carefully.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.674 align:middle line:90%
Get out of here.

00:13:12.674 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:10%
And that was it.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And I told you I
had-- maybe the same day.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it was last week.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: It was the
same guy, wasn't it.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It wasn't.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:10%
Mine was Officer Good.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:10%
But it was a similar
conversation, where I thought,

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:10%
it didn't used to be this
speed in this little area here.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, sure enough,
that they had changed it.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.359 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, so why?

00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And once he explained it
to me, I said, you know,

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:90%
that's a very good point.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.010 align:middle line:90%
It was the same thing.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a respectful
conversation between us.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: That's
discretionary, wise,

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.830 align:middle line:10%
policing of things that
are common sense that we

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:10%
momentarily, genuinely,
it slips our mind.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.950 align:middle line:10%
We were busy, we were
in a rush, whatever.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.187 align:middle line:10%
In England, going back to
the CCTV, on the motorways,

00:13:49.187 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:10%
they call them in England,
you know, the freeways,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:10%
they have these things
called SPECS cameras.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:10%
These yellow cameras on
top of the poles, and they

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:10%
measure your
average distance-- I

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:10%
beg your pardon, your average
speed over a given distance,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:10%
and you just get a ticket.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:10%
There's no discretion in that.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:10%
There's no human beings
involved in that.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:10%
That's just a machine
issuing tickets.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:10%
And they've been trialing
this in Glasgow and Edinburgh,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:10%
where, not only for
motorists, but any offense.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:10%
They'll run your
plate as you drive

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:10%
through a city, regardless of
any sort of probable cause.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't come into it.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.220 align:middle line:10%
They run the plate of your
car as you drive through,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:10%
and anything wrong at all,
with you, your car, your being,

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.742 align:middle line:10%
your insurance, your medical,
anything wrong at all.

00:14:33.742 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: If you're
late on a bill.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: If you've
been late on a bill.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:10%
That's coming next.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.060 align:middle line:10%
If you ever had any
mental health problems,

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.880 align:middle line:10%
they can see that data.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:10%
Believe me, they can see that.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:10%
Because our equivalent
of the emergency

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:10%
terrorist provision
means that they

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:10%
can access any information
in any database

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.117 align:middle line:10%
and share it without
your knowledge.

00:14:55.117 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, and we were speaking
off-camera about this.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And you were saying,
but still, we

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:84%
have to remember
that in this country,

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:84%
we're sitting in
the US right now,

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.669 align:middle line:84%
there is actually still a fair
amount of freedom, relatively

00:15:09.669 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
speaking, to the
rest of the country.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think of it more as
invasion through credit card

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:84%
companies or email
exchanges and so forth.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, a man
that everyone loved,

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:10%
it was kind of like a funny
version of "V for Vendetta"

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.490 align:middle line:10%
in one way.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:10%
There was a fellow
in Phoenix, Arizona

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:10%
who-- they had just installed
those cameras on the freeway.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:10%
And this was where
everyone blasts to work.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Of course you're
going to go 70 or 75.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.240 align:middle line:90%
It's built for that.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And they had lowered
the speed limit.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So this fellow would
put on his gorilla suit

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and then speed
through every day.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
He had like one ticket after
another that was sent to him.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: But they
couldn't identify him.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They
couldn't identify him,

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:10%
because you had to
identify the face.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:10%
So what they did,
they changed the law--

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:10%
that you only had to have the
license plate number-- because

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.932 align:middle line:10%
of this little
gorilla road warrior.

00:16:01.932 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: That's funny.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:10%
That's funny, that is.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But that
someone did it,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:10%
and it forced their hand to
have to do something about it,

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.364 align:middle line:10%
I thought was just a
beautiful act of resistance.

00:16:11.364 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And one thing,
that-- I will sum up

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
some of the differences
between Europe and America

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:90%
in this sentence.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:84%
That America is so new, there's
only 300 years of history,

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:23.770 align:middle line:90%
effectively.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.686 align:middle line:84%
So new, that your pioneering
spirit of all these people

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:30.185 align:middle line:84%
who went to different places,
some of them doing bad things,

00:16:30.185 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:84%
some of them doing good things,
but that pioneering spirit

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.640 align:middle line:90%
has not disappeared yet.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.226 align:middle line:84%
In England, I'm
sad to say, and I

00:16:37.226 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:84%
love England like nowhere
else on the planet,

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.542 align:middle line:90%
but that doesn't exist.

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
In the spiritual and conscious
communities, it's different.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:90%
People are awesome.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.054 align:middle line:84%
Really, seriously,
radically awesome.

00:16:47.054 --> 00:16:48.345 align:middle line:90%
And that's not going to change.

00:16:48.345 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But in the mainstream,
there is now

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:84%
a cynicism and a
resignation and a sense,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:90%
a smell in the air of defeat.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
That's not helping
anything at all there.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Here it's different,
where people

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:84%
don't want-- Americans don't
like to be told what to do.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Or let's say less than
the Europeans, right?

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.472 align:middle line:10%
Europeans have been used
to being squashed down

00:17:10.472 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:10%
for thousands of years.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:10%
Americans have not.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:10%
Where I live, in a lovely
coastal community, the Sheriff,

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:10%
I know who he is.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.465 align:middle line:10%
And like, if you
see something bad,

00:17:19.465 --> 00:17:21.090 align:middle line:10%
you're in immediate
trouble, because he

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:21.965 align:middle line:10%
knows who people are.

00:17:21.965 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:10%
It's like old school
policing, right?

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:10%
The church people,
I know who they are.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:28.810 align:middle line:10%
They know who I am.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:10%
I've spoken at their church.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:10%
The lady at the post
office, I know who she is,

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.250 align:middle line:10%
and if something
goes wrong, she'll

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:10%
use her discretion
to change things.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:10%
You know, if mail's
gone astray or whatever.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.890 align:middle line:10%
And there's just this old,
simple thing of community.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:10%
We know who each other are,
and there's accountability.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:90%
And there's responsibility.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And we know that we
keep each other sane

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.436 align:middle line:84%
and safe and equitable through
that network of accountability.

00:17:55.436 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
is really key.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Because that's part of
regaining sovereignty.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.166 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:10%
And the power is spread
throughout the community.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:10%
It's not just with
people with bits

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.479 align:middle line:10%
of paper in City
Hall or whatever.

00:18:06.479 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:10%
It's with everyone.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:10%
And the police, if they
do something stupid,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:10%
they will be like castigated
and excommunicated.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:10%
So they have to
behave themselves,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:10%
which is how it ought to be.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.150 align:middle line:10%
So there's an equilibrium
when the numbers of people

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.660 align:middle line:10%
are of a certain low,
sustainable level.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The last thing you want
is a booming community.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
That's a disaster
for a community.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:90%
You want stable numbers.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Some new incomers,
some people go out.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Sure, that's life.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Some people migrate inwards
for economic reasons, sure.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:90%
That's life.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But the community has a definite
character and a definite spirit

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and a set of qualities
and properties

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that need to be celebrated
and engaged with and upheld,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is being
destroyed in Europe.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.890 align:middle line:10%
Where a community cannot
celebrate its character of any

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:10%
description, religiously or
ethnically or historically

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:10%
or in any sense.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:10%
Any cultural, basic human
sense, because it's now

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:10%
against the law to do some
of those things because it

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:10%
may incite racial hatred.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:10%
So diversity,
which nobody really

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:10%
understands what that word
is in Britain anymore,

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:28.190 align:middle line:10%
is become a terribly disengaging
and discriminatory act as far

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:10%
as they're concerned.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, and you bring
up a really good point.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.050 align:middle line:84%
That was a powerful endorsement
for small town living,

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
by the way, and small
town living in America.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think even in
small town England,

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.005 align:middle line:84%
it's still similar
in a lot of ways.

00:19:41.005 --> 00:19:41.630 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:10%
In some communities,
they've got it right.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: People still
know each other's business

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:10%
and look out for each other.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:10%
But I think it's
important to note, also,

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:10%
that you don't have to
be living in a small town

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:10%
in order to begin bringing
the spirit of small community.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.420 align:middle line:10%
You can bring it to your block,
your neighborhood, your street.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: You can.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:10%
Use people's names.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.724 align:middle line:10%
Speak to people and
learn their names.

00:19:59.724 --> 00:20:01.098 align:middle line:10%
So when I go into
the post office

00:20:01.098 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:10%
and say, good morning,
Tina, how are you?

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:10%
She says, it's lovely to
see you Neil, how are you?

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's a bit
cloudy today, but I

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:10%
think it's going to--
those little things.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:10%
Know what somebody's name is.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.380 align:middle line:10%
Do you know the names of
the people on your street?

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:10%
Do they know your name?

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's not OK to just drive
past someone, and just do that.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:10%
Make yourself acquainted
with the people

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:10%
that you live with, because
in times of earth changes,

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:10%
and when I was involved
in this massive,

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:10%
as we call it, snowpocalypse
a few years ago,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.190 align:middle line:10%
no power for 10 days.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:84%
No running water, no power, no
heat, no electricity, nothing.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Icy conditions, zero,
subzero temperatures.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
The thing that made
that OK was community.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:84%
After a couple of days, when
things are clear that it's not

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.602 align:middle line:84%
going to go away anytime soon,
the issue, the Earth change,

00:20:48.602 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
it was a little
micro Earth change,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:84%
but it was emblematic of a
broader Earth change that

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:90%
may come upon us at any time.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Community was the
thing that made it OK.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:84%
That everyone had
a skill to offer.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:84%
We generated our own comfort
and security and resources

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:10%
And it was a lovely
example to me

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:10%
of thinking, that's the
thing that counts here,

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:10%
that you have to
know the community.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to be involved in the
evolution of that community.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Or shut your mouth.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:10%
You can't just complain
on an internet forum

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:10%
about how dreadful-- be
involved or shut your mouth.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So
culturally, that's how

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:10%
we begin to transform and
regain our sovereignty.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: You have to be up to
your neck in your own evolution

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.840 align:middle line:10%
physically, in your actions
and deeds, in the place

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:10%
that you're at.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.250 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it's not
necessarily your street,

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.962 align:middle line:10%
but the community might
be a community center,

00:21:39.962 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:10%
it might be a
conference you do, it

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.364 align:middle line:10%
might be a men's or
women's or spiritual group.

00:21:44.364 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:10%
It could be all kinds.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.350 align:middle line:10%
It could be a fishing club.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:10%
It could be anything.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.216 align:middle line:10%
It could be a knitting club.

00:21:48.216 --> 00:21:48.740 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter what
it is, but to introduce

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:10%
these ideas and
the opportunities

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:10%
together gives an
incredible sense

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:10%
of camaraderie and
comradeship and fellowship.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And in times of change,
they're very important.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
But they also begin to
model something vital, which

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is people begin to realize
that you don't need

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
the authorities for education,
for legal protection,

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
for enforcement of
common sense laws,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
for medicine, for
wisdom, for religion.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't need establishments
and institutions for those.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:84%
When you have a wise community
with a solid character,

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:84%
you can begin to provide
those things for yourself.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.790 align:middle line:10%
Another excellent thing
I learned last week,

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:36.940 align:middle line:10%
lots of women who home
school and unschool--

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:10%
the definition of
unschooling is,

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:10%
everything you did before you
went to school and everything

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:10%
you did after you
went to school, right?

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:90%
All the learning.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So all my learning
was outside of school.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So I am an unschooler
in my very nature.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:10%
Those women are now
getting together

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:10%
and realizing that their
education wisdom that they

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:10%
can share with these young
people, their children

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.440 align:middle line:10%
and others, surpasses
in quality what

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:10%
happens in the most
expensive schools in America.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:10%
And they can deliver
a quality of education

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:10%
and a socializing grace
to their children,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:10%
where they're studying
mathematics and English,

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:10%
language, history, biology,
all those wonderful things.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.170 align:middle line:10%
But they're also going playing
at hockey, they're dancing,

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:10%
they're playing baseball.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:10%
They're with their friends.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:10%
They do acting.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:10%
So their social skills are also
developing at a higher rate.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.025 align:middle line:10%
And it's producing
real human beings.

00:23:30.025 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.567 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Not
subjects of empire.

00:23:32.567 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I was going to get to that in
a little bit, the whole notion

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
of regaining sovereignty
and radically revising

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:90%
the educational system.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.580 align:middle line:10%
So these mothers have
gotten together to do that.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:10%
I mean, is there an
answer that maybe

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:10%
is more broad
sweeping than that?

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:10%
In your opinion, if you're
now modeling the path

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:10%
to sovereignty and its interface
with the existing education

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.840 align:middle line:10%
system?

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: You have to begin
to generate your own resources

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.570 align:middle line:10%
and materials and focus.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:10%
Whatever it is.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:10%
Whether it's education,
whether it's power, whatever.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:10%
So a group of people can get
together and buy solar power

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:10%
and stop relying on the
utilities by 30%, and then 50%,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:10%
and then 70%, and then maybe,
in the future, altogether.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:10%
People can start to
edge away from a system,

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.814 align:middle line:10%
rather than just cut it off.

00:24:21.814 --> 00:24:23.730 align:middle line:10%
And as we said previously,
to just go and live

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:10%
in a cabin with some
beans and a shotgun,

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:10%
that's not going
to suit everybody.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:10%
And if you've only woken up
halfway through your process,

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:10%
which most people have, you've
already got a lot of things

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:10%
to contend with.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:10%
So you have to make some
conscious decisions that

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.040 align:middle line:10%
suit your family.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:10%
If your daughter wants
to-- as my niece wants

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.900 align:middle line:10%
to be in medicine, she's
at a good university

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.650 align:middle line:10%
studying medicine.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:10%
That's what she's chosen to do.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:10%
She also realizes
that she's interfacing

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.770 align:middle line:10%
with the system for
certain purposes.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.730 align:middle line:10%
But that may give her the
springboard, for example,

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:10%
to later change the way
she practices medicine

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:10%
and bring in more holistic
and wise and spiritual aspect

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:10%
to it.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.609 align:middle line:10%
So you can't prescribe a
way forward for people.

00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm speaking more
of the younger years, where

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
it's total indoctrination and
memorization for the most part.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:10%
If I was-- I don't
have any children.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:10%
I would never send my
kids to-- in England,

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.369 align:middle line:10%
we have primary school, high
school, college and university.

00:25:20.369 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:10%
I would never send my kids
to any of those things

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:10%
unless they expressed a
strong desire to do it.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:10%
Then I'd listen and
we'd talk about it.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.011 align:middle line:10%
But I would never do
that, because they're not

00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:30.635 align:middle line:10%
being educated.

00:25:30.635 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:10%
They're being given a series
of vocational instructions

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:10%
for employment.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:10%
They're being programmed
for employment,

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:10%
and they're being programmed
to accept a series of norms,

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.830 align:middle line:10%
that between 7 and 14, and then
14 and 21, those critical seven

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:10%
year cycles, the brain soaks
up stuff and then closes.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And typically, at
21 it's closed.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:90%
It's finished.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:84%
You can open that up again
with your psychic can opener

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and get going.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But for many people, it
finishes at that point.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:10%
So if you can have a child
from 17 to 21, you've got it,

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:10%
they are robots.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:10%
They're going to go out
and follow a program.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to do anything
outside of that program.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Every hand movement,
every gesture,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.090 align:middle line:84%
every dream that they
have, is all programmed.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.570 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a single
free will exercise

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:90%
in an asleep human being.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:10%
It's all symptomatic
and end process material

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:10%
from a series of
instructions given

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:10%
to them between the
ages of 7 and 14.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, there's
a lot of leeway.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:10%
But 7 to 14,
something is happening

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:10%
in a young person,
where you need

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:10%
a great diversity of
import from wise elders.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.580 align:middle line:90%
We'll use that phrase once more.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I was at
high school, there

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
were no wise elders
in my high school.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Not a single one,
I'm sad to say.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:84%
When I went to art
college, we were lucky.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.820 align:middle line:10%
We had two excellent-- a man
and a lady, who were awesome

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.020 align:middle line:10%
and were wise elders, and
showed us the relationship--

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:10%
this is going to be a nice
segue into philosophy and music

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:10%
and art in education.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:10%
How critically
important they were.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:10%
And they were passionate,
passionate people.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:10%
And I share that passion.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, when I get a
bit worked up, or sad or angry,

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.312 align:middle line:10%
I do it gleefully.

00:27:15.312 --> 00:27:17.895 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember when they did
it for me, what an impression

00:27:17.895 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:90%
it made.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought, they really
care about this.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And she said, art
is not a play thing.

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Art is the expression
of your soul.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And through the manifestation
of that art, whether it's music

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.770 align:middle line:84%
or whether it is literature
or whether it's painting,

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, you learn
something critical

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.790 align:middle line:90%
about the human condition.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.590 align:middle line:84%
To take that out of
education, you might as well

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.730 align:middle line:90%
stop reading and writing.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.390 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree
more, because when you're

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:10%
talking about art,
you're talking

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.400 align:middle line:10%
about engaging the human
facility for creativity.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:10%
Primal force.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And once that's
engaged and awakened again,

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.510 align:middle line:10%
if it's been put to sleep
for whatever reason,

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:10%
it can be applied
to anything else,

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:10%
including restructuring
of all the other systems.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And so to have
creative individuals

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
is not part of the
game plan at large,

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:90%
as far as I'm witnessing.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Creativity, largely
speaking, with refinement,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:90%
leads to freedom and power.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:84%
If it's left unwieldy,
it just leads

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:84%
to a kind of bohemian
self-destruction.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Which can be very lovely
and gratifying and tempting

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.170 align:middle line:84%
at times, to be honest,
but not very helpful.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.512 align:middle line:84%
The four primal forces
in a human being for me

00:28:29.512 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
are creation, destruction,
solidity, and yielding.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And any child's education has
to show the delicate and sublime

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.790 align:middle line:90%
interplay between those factors.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:90%
That's absent.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:10%
There's no talk
of that in school.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.580 align:middle line:10%
When I was in high school in
a nice rural part of Northwest

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.540 align:middle line:10%
England called Cheshire,
it's a very nice high school.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Still very-- it was kind of
like Harry Potter looking.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful old
building, very ancient.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it was established
in the 16th century.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:90%
An old school, right?

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:84%
With certain principles and
certain ethics about education.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.070 align:middle line:90%
And it was still poor.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.012 align:middle line:90%
Very, very poor.

00:29:07.012 --> 00:29:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And I look back on
it now and think

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:12.310 align:middle line:84%
about the crime of
time that was wasted.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.292 align:middle line:10%
And I look at the young
people now, and some of them

00:29:15.292 --> 00:29:15.875 align:middle line:10%
are excellent.

00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:16.897 align:middle line:10%
There is always that.

00:29:16.897 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:90%
There's always that.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.063 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Their spirit's broken.

00:29:19.063 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: But the
principle of education

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.490 align:middle line:84%
was dispensed with, as
far as I can discover,

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
in about the 1920s after
the first World War.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:90%
People gave up on it.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:10%
And it was no longer
considered an elementary part

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:10%
of a human being's education
to have a classical education

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:10%
and a love of knowledge,
which is wisdom.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.440 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.330 align:middle line:10%
So that whole thing of
being a philosopher.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:10%
You know, "philo"
is-- the word "philo"

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:10%
and the word "sophia"
is to love knowledge.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:10%
Philo sophia.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:10%
A philosopher is
somebody who realizes

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:10%
that knowledge and
wisdom are experiential.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:10%
You don't just do it in a book
in a little room with a tweed

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:10%
waistcoat on.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.429 align:middle line:10%
You do it in life.

00:30:06.429 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:10%
You do it with your children
when they're on your knee,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.710 align:middle line:10%
puking up over the
back your shoulder.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.640 align:middle line:10%
You do it when
somebody's laid dead

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:10%
in a coffin in
front of your face.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.770 align:middle line:90%
You do in an airplane.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.770 align:middle line:84%
You do it in the cafe,
putting sugar in your coffee.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, wisdom
permeates everything.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:10%
And you're supposed
to be activating

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.642 align:middle line:10%
that in young people.

00:30:24.642 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:10%
And there's no mention of it.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:10%
None at all.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.340 align:middle line:10%
None at all.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.590 align:middle line:10%
The word philosophy
was probably not

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:33.950 align:middle line:10%
mentioned in all the years that
I was at this good high school.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.250 align:middle line:10%
Not at all.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.030 align:middle line:10%
I fell over it backwards in
the dark one day, and thought,

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:10%
this is an essential
part of human life.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.300 align:middle line:10%
And in my formative education,
nobody mentioned it.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:10%
That's interesting.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.816 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you
went to a good school.

00:30:47.816 --> 00:30:49.590 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And I went
to a good school.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.800 align:middle line:10%
Crumbs, heavens above, whatever.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.320 align:middle line:10%
Who knows what's happening?

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.710 align:middle line:10%
Who knows what's happening
in the inner city

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:10%
rough schools where there's
these terrible segregated

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.380 align:middle line:10%
racial people with
different kind

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.290 align:middle line:10%
of terrible
underprivileged conditions,

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.920 align:middle line:10%
whether they're
black, white, you

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:10%
know, yellow, red,
purple, green, who knows.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Everyone trying
to just survive the day.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.611 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: But everyone's
trying to survive.

00:31:14.611 --> 00:31:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And a good day in
those schools is

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.160 align:middle line:84%
to come home with no blood
hanging out of your nose.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:10%
What's happening there
with those people

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.950 align:middle line:10%
is they're getting
completely conditioned

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.180 align:middle line:10%
to regard themselves
as subjects.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.020 align:middle line:10%
It's not just a
lack of education.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:10%
It's to say, you are nothing.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.280 align:middle line:10%
Unless you go out and take,
you will have nothing.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Which is a very negative and
harmful message, in my view.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:90%
You create what you need.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:90%
You don't take it.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:90%
You create it.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:44.280 align:middle line:10%
So they have a fabricated,
manipulated view

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:10%
of their own self-worth, which
basically, their self-esteem is

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.070 align:middle line:10%
just trickled down the toilet.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.180 align:middle line:10%
There's none left.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:10%
And that creates resentment
and embitterment, and violence.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:00.050 align:middle line:10%
And that violence in England
and Sweden in particular,

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.490 align:middle line:10%
two places I care a
lot about, is just

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:03.915 align:middle line:10%
teetering on the
edge of disaster.

00:32:03.915 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's horrible.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:05.629 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:07.405 align:middle line:10%
I mean, so different
than 40 years ago.

00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And that's
nothing to do with race.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.100 align:middle line:10%
It always shows itself in race.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:10%
But it's not.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:10%
It's to do with a very
carefully, meticulously

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:10%
engineered program of
de-education of human beings

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.400 align:middle line:10%
which will take
out the people who

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.360 align:middle line:10%
they press the button on first.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:32.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's just a terrible example
of unprincipled, irresponsible

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:10%
migration into
Britain from countries

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:10%
who have absolutely
no interest whatsoever

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.760 align:middle line:10%
in being part of wonderful,
rich, beautiful, English

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.300 align:middle line:10%
culture.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:10%
They come for the money.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:10%
And that's all
they're coming for.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:10%
And the health care.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:10%
And that's all.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.255 align:middle line:10%
And that is a
recipe for disaster.

00:32:50.255 --> 00:32:53.250 align:middle line:10%
And it's been going
on for 60 years now.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's just getting
to the point where,

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.402 align:middle line:84%
for the very, very
first time-- this

00:32:57.402 --> 00:32:59.610 align:middle line:84%
is another show for another
time-- people are saying,

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.230 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to
do that anymore.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:90%
We like it the way it is.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is an illegal
thought in England.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know it is.

00:33:06.665 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just shocking
what's happened.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.550 align:middle line:10%
But we all have the right to
endorse the things that we

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.400 align:middle line:10%
believe in, the things that
we love, whatever that may be.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.609 align:middle line:90%
But now it's viewed I think--

00:33:17.609 --> 00:33:18.316 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: You do.

00:33:18.316 --> 00:33:19.630 align:middle line:90%
You do with your Constitution.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:84%
That right does not
exist in England.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a human concept and it's
a human impulse, for sure.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.034 align:middle line:84%
But law is against
that in England.

00:33:30.034 --> 00:33:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is so weird.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:10%
Because conversely, you
know, flag waving, you know,

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.490 align:middle line:10%
Kate's having another baby.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.702 align:middle line:10%
God save the queen.

00:33:38.702 --> 00:33:39.660 align:middle line:10%
I mean, to be British--

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.350 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Good luck, Kate.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --to be British,
it's in the media,

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:10%
is constantly perpetuating
the notion of being British.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:49.940 align:middle line:10%
It's a flag waving, in
that sense, country,

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:10%
yet you can't actually express
your-- what you just said.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.500 align:middle line:10%
You can't express
your appreciation

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.200 align:middle line:10%
for a way of life that once was.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:05.214 align:middle line:10%
I went to my very first 4th
of July barbecue this year.

00:34:05.214 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:10%
And the people I was with
were excellent and lovely.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:12.601 align:middle line:84%
And they were patriotic in an
intelligent and broad and human

00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:13.100 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
we like our community.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:90%
God bless America.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.542 align:middle line:90%
Let's have some sausages.

00:34:17.542 --> 00:34:18.041 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
what was going on.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
it was hot dogs.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Hot dogs.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:21.746 align:middle line:90%
Beg your pardon.

00:34:21.746 --> 00:34:22.281 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:22.281 --> 00:34:23.739 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
British, sausages.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Sausages, yeah.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.739 align:middle line:90%
Nobody says that, do they?

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:30.830 align:middle line:84%
During that time, I saw all
these flags out, of course.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know what the
people are thinking,

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
which is, we like
our way of life.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
We do have certain
freedoms here that

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.630 align:middle line:84%
appear to be
disappearing elsewhere.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.750 align:middle line:90%
We like the way we do things.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And the principle
of what's happening

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:84%
in America in its pure
state is quite good.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:90%
And I would agree with that.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.270 align:middle line:84%
However, if they knew what
that flag actually represented,

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:middle line:90%
they would set it on fire.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the flag is not
what they think it is.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the great
dilemma that we

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.580 align:middle line:84%
talked about last time,
the invisibility of empire.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:10%
To wave a stars and
stripes or a Union flag

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:12.930 align:middle line:10%
is a very unusual thing to
do because it is emblazoned

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:17.170 align:middle line:10%
with these symbols
of subjecting oneself

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:10%
to control, outside control.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you raise
that flag, you're

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:84%
not saying I like my community
and my kindred spirits;

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:90%
you are giving your power away.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And so that's part
of the challenge.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Because some of those people
are good men, good women.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.350 align:middle line:84%
They're like good
old boys or whatever.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And if your house was burning
down, they'd drag you out,

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.510 align:middle line:90%
and the dog as well.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're solid, salt
of the earth people.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:90%
They don't understand.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:84%
They have no notion
at all of it.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:10%
And when they hear somebody
like me say, don't waive a flag

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.664 align:middle line:10%
and don't vote, they
think it's 1960 again.

00:35:50.664 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's where
we're going next.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:53.480 align:middle line:10%
OK, voting.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.910 align:middle line:10%
So sovereignty and
the reformation

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:58.800 align:middle line:10%
of political systems.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.750 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Discuss.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.710 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.490 align:middle line:10%
Political systems,
again, my benchmark

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.100 align:middle line:10%
is when I look at
the body politic

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:10%
in England, in the
United Kingdom,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.670 align:middle line:10%
in Britain, however you
want to describe it,

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.090 align:middle line:10%
I don't see any wisdom.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.940 align:middle line:84%
There was wisdom in the
'50s and '60s a little bit,

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:84%
from what I can
gather from history.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And my father assures
me that in the '70s

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:84%
there were the last vestiges
of wisdom in politics.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:31.220 align:middle line:10%
When I started to open my eyes
as a young man in the '80s,

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:10%
I saw no wisdom.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:33.930 align:middle line:10%
None at all.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.110 align:middle line:10%
So I can't understand
how you can

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:10%
have a system of people
with no wisdom determining

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.130 align:middle line:10%
the administration of
a country and the laws

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.750 align:middle line:10%
that govern that
behavior in that country.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.020 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense to me.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
For that reason, I refuse to
give my consent to that system.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So I refuse to give it
my philosophical energy,

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.880 align:middle line:90%
and I refuse to give it my vote.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the vote
is the primary way

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.360 align:middle line:90%
of giving consent to a system.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.000 align:middle line:10%
What I do vote for
is local events

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.060 align:middle line:10%
that affect the community.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And if, like, a guy
is going to do this,

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and he does a great
job, he'll get my vote

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.920 align:middle line:90%
in simple human terms.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:10%
If this guy comes in and
he's just a son of a gun,

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.980 align:middle line:10%
and I know it's not--
he won't get my vote.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:10%
And that's what voting is.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.944 align:middle line:10%
That's what it's
supposed to be, right?

00:37:23.944 --> 00:37:26.028 align:middle line:10%
You vote for somebody who
you feel can do the job.

00:37:26.028 --> 00:37:27.444 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Rather
than the illusion

00:37:27.444 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:10%
of which is the better
candidate for president.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.230 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And is a true
representative of it.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.470 align:middle line:10%
But using the system
where you have

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.760 align:middle line:10%
these different groups
and the houses and schools

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.350 align:middle line:10%
and all these different colleges
and the electoral-- that

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.590 align:middle line:10%
does not represent society.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:10%
And when I see-- whether
it's Bill Clinton or George

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.910 align:middle line:10%
Bush or Barack Obama,
there's really, to me,

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.300 align:middle line:10%
not a great deal of difference.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.410 align:middle line:10%
And I would even go
so far as to say--

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:10%
I might regret this one day--
the Obama administration is one

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:10%
of the most draconian I've
ever seen in the Western world.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:08.670 align:middle line:10%
And I say that primarily because
of his apparent willingness

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:10%
to follow instructions.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.870 align:middle line:10%
It's not him, the man.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:10%
I don't know him, the man.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:13.760 align:middle line:10%
He might be a nice bloke.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm on about him in his office,
in his post as a servant.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.631 align:middle line:10%
As the ultimate servant
of a country, right?

00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he's not
serving the country

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.610 align:middle line:84%
rather than whoever's
requesting of him.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:24.390 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: He's
serving someone else

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:10%
and what they're requesting
of him is to say,

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.640 align:middle line:10%
you must take that
Constitution apart.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.090 align:middle line:10%
Where it's viewed not
as something to uphold.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:34.710 align:middle line:10%
Imperfect, but good.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But a historical, eccentric
curiosity that we can just go,

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.630 align:middle line:84%
well, this is just
a lot of rubbish.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you know,
sometimes is takes someone

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.190 align:middle line:10%
from the outside,
such as yourself,

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.590 align:middle line:10%
to point that out
to the rest of us.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.560 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: That
Constitution, your First

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.610 align:middle line:10%
and Second Amendments
are the only things

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:10%
you need to worry about.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:48.830 align:middle line:10%
Yes, the Fifth.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:49.730 align:middle line:10%
Yes, the 16th.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.070 align:middle line:10%
All these different things.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:10%
Your First and Second
Amendments are absolutely gold.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.880 align:middle line:10%
They should be protected.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.645 align:middle line:10%
In a great, wonderful,
enlightened society,

00:38:58.645 --> 00:39:01.010 align:middle line:10%
you don't need to
protect free speech.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.150 align:middle line:90%
You don't need firearms.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.816 align:middle line:84%
You can dispense--
they're silly, right?

00:39:03.816 --> 00:39:04.855 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:39:04.855 --> 00:39:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But in a state of empire,
you need those two things.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.980 align:middle line:84%
You need the ability to
defend your gift of life

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to speak
about your gift of life.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.780 align:middle line:90%
And those, that's all it is.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.200 align:middle line:10%
And whether you
choose personally

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:10%
to speak or to defend yourself
is your private business.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:84%
But to have that enshrined on
a piece of paper that carries

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.186 align:middle line:90%
weight is priceless.

00:39:28.186 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it takes,
maybe sometimes, as I said,

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:90%
an outsider.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.637 align:middle line:84%
In this case, a Brit, to tell
us how privileged we still are.

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:35.720 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: You are very
privileged in this country.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.095 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But we
must protect it.

00:39:37.095 --> 00:39:40.820 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And you must see
that freedom and that privilege

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.180 align:middle line:10%
as a great responsibility
to do something with it.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Not just to sit back and
think, aren't we great?

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Because there are powers that
are trying to erode that.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:84%
In England, there is
no freedom of speech.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.850 align:middle line:84%
In England, there is no
ability for the citizens

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.500 align:middle line:90%
to defend themselves.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.690 align:middle line:90%
That's gone.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.010 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't exist anymore.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.970 align:middle line:84%
You cannot get on the radio
and say whatever you like.

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:02.380 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do that.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.360 align:middle line:84%
You cannot defend your
family, should you need to.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do that.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There have been some
catastrophic repercussions

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:09.870 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:10.953 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: You can't do it.

00:40:10.953 --> 00:40:13.560 align:middle line:10%
If you get caught with
certain words coming out

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.030 align:middle line:10%
of your mouth or certain
objects in your pocket,

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.720 align:middle line:10%
you go to prison, and
that's the end of it.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.400 align:middle line:10%
So that is a
draconian system that

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.080 align:middle line:10%
has crept up on my fellow
British citizens and companions

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:10%
and friends over
the last 60 years.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's talk
about the effect of empire

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:84%
on spirituality,
but also taking back

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:84%
that essential refinement
in our own lives.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: If you consider
yourself your own authority,

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.840 align:middle line:90%
lots of things fall into place.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.370 align:middle line:84%
If you ever bow down to
authority, lots of things

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.670 align:middle line:90%
begin to drift.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:55.270 align:middle line:10%
A good test is that if a
policeman knocks on your door,

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:10%
how do you feel?

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Most people go-- ooh.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh gosh.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:59.719 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong.

00:40:59.719 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:01.749 align:middle line:90%
What-- is somebody dead?

00:41:01.749 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Have I done-- ah!

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:06.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I-- I feel quite
differently about that.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:07.870 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: I know you do.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.160 align:middle line:10%
If a policeman knocks on your
door, how do you feel, right?

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:10%
That's a good
benchmark for this.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:13.483 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Indignant.

00:41:13.483 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:10%
What are you doing
here on my property?

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:17.160 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: So that
is a lovely test.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.770 align:middle line:10%
Because prior generations,
my parents and grandparents

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.850 align:middle line:10%
and great grandparents'
generation, those authority

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:26.490 align:middle line:10%
figures, you just did
what you were told.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So this movement
of empire, let's

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.320 align:middle line:84%
just acknowledge for
a minute, that it's

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.210 align:middle line:90%
brought a great teaching to us.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Which is, hang on a second.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.790 align:middle line:84%
No, you don't do
what you're told.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.300 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't do that.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And just because they've
got a badge and a uniform

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.605 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that you
should do what you're told.

00:41:44.605 --> 00:41:45.105 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:45.105 --> 00:41:47.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, that in England
was unthinkable

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.560 align:middle line:10%
in the 1920s and '30s
and '40s and '50s.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.260 align:middle line:84%
You did what you were
told because there

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:56.480 align:middle line:84%
was the conception,
which is a misconception,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.759 align:middle line:84%
there was the idea that
the government is good,

00:41:58.759 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:84%
they're voted in by
the people, and they're

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:01.680 align:middle line:90%
doing a very, very good job.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.305 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the
best they can in very

00:42:03.305 --> 00:42:04.790 align:middle line:90%
difficult circumstances.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.560 align:middle line:10%
We know now that
that's not true.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.980 align:middle line:10%
And it has never been true.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.810 align:middle line:10%
In all of ancient history,
going back as far as you

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:13.880 align:middle line:10%
can, 8,000 years.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.920 align:middle line:10%
It gets hazy prior to that.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:10%
So certainly, in
the last 2000 years,

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.850 align:middle line:10%
where we have a decent
record of history in Britain,

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:26.450 align:middle line:10%
I can't see any examples of
wise, equitable management

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.710 align:middle line:10%
of people through a
freely elected government.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.990 align:middle line:10%
Not a single example of it.

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:34.870 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, some of
those rules change.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:35.520 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:40.320 align:middle line:10%
So you do get conscious,
excellent, community policing

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:10%
to make sure that when there's
a problem it's dealt with.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.660 align:middle line:10%
But they're not enforcing
things necessarily.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.816 align:middle line:84%
Because the community
doesn't require it.

00:42:47.816 --> 00:42:49.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a completely
different thing, though,

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:52.060 align:middle line:84%
where those guys are
being militarized.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, they are.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.330 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And we've seen
that with many recent events.

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: All over
Europe, America, yes.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:58.780 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: All over Europe
that's already happened.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's very sad.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.970 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: You're getting a
taste of it now, in Ferguson

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.590 align:middle line:10%
and places like that.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.950 align:middle line:10%
That's-- we've seen that
for a long, long time.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.860 align:middle line:84%
We've seen people get
batonned and crushed.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is
a frightening image.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It is a
frightening image.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.060 align:middle line:10%
And it says to
people, there really

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.720 align:middle line:10%
isn't a separation between
the military and the local law

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.220 align:middle line:10%
enforcement.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.820 align:middle line:10%
There really isn't a separation.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.020 align:middle line:10%
We sometimes look exactly the
same, and we'll all shoot you.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And we'll all
ultimately take an oath

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.960 align:middle line:90%
that is against human nature.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.470 align:middle line:10%
There is other
great men and women

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:40.580 align:middle line:10%
who work in law enforcement and
military and medicine and fire

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.740 align:middle line:10%
who do not agree with that
and have a very different view

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.910 align:middle line:10%
of that oath and are actually
trying to serve the community

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.310 align:middle line:10%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.490 align:middle line:10%
But that's a separate movement.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:53.590 align:middle line:10%
So within what we're
talking about today,

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.790 align:middle line:10%
you have to begin
to detach the two.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:10%
To say perhaps we don't need
anybody to tell us what to do.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.040 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps if we structure
our community in such a way,

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.475 align:middle line:10%
that won't bother
the authorities.

00:44:05.475 --> 00:44:07.766 align:middle line:10%
Because you say, well, I
don't know what they're doing.

00:44:07.766 --> 00:44:10.840 align:middle line:10%
But we have no claim
on what they're doing,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.330 align:middle line:10%
because that land is their land.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:14.510 align:middle line:10%
They own it.

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.180 align:middle line:10%
There's no zoning laws
to it, because it's

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.430 align:middle line:10%
a Native American
tribal community

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.600 align:middle line:10%
that they have a pact
with, which then puts it

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.230 align:middle line:10%
outside of our-- they have
no business, literally,

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.210 align:middle line:10%
to walk through your front gate.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:28.450 align:middle line:10%
You don't have any address.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.120 align:middle line:10%
An address is a contract.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.430 align:middle line:10%
You don't have an address.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.030 align:middle line:10%
You don't have a name.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.602 align:middle line:10%
There's no need
for you to pay tax

00:44:34.602 --> 00:44:36.560 align:middle line:10%
if you're not in the
system, because you're not

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.730 align:middle line:10%
taking part in it.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:39.521 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
addressed this quite a bit

00:44:39.521 --> 00:44:44.670 align:middle line:84%
in the first conversation, which
is a serious choice to make.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there are-- right now--

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:46.875 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You don't
do it lightly,

00:44:46.875 --> 00:44:47.250 align:middle line:90%
or you could end up in prison.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You don't
do it lightly.

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.150 align:middle line:10%
And again, for anyone who hasn't
already seen the first part,

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:10%
I think they need to look at the
first part of the conversation.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: They need to
take a look at it, yeah.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.101 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:54.101 --> 00:44:56.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's another area I
think we can just brush on,

00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:01.890 align:middle line:10%
because it's so massive that it
really should be-- maybe done

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:05.300 align:middle line:10%
in entire length format
one time, between us.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk a little
bit about the reformation

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.980 align:middle line:90%
of economics.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Because this is huge.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:13.530 align:middle line:90%
It affects everyone.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:14.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a massive subject.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just give us
a thumbnail sketch

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:19.360 align:middle line:84%
before we move on
to our final point.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:24.120 align:middle line:10%
The simple fact is we should
never be using money, period.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.130 align:middle line:10%
It disconnects human
beings from growth.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:30.390 align:middle line:10%
So every time we lay
our hands upon it,

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.060 align:middle line:10%
it puts us in a
compromised position.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.670 align:middle line:10%
However, as we all do, we
wake up during the process,

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:38.590 align:middle line:10%
not at the beginning
of it or the end of it,

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:40.090 align:middle line:10%
but somewhere in the middle.

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:43.580 align:middle line:10%
And the process is, we use
these little bits of paper

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:48.130 align:middle line:10%
and these pixels on a screen
to denominate and classify

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:50.591 align:middle line:10%
different levels of
access to resources.

00:45:50.591 --> 00:45:51.090 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.020 align:middle line:10%
That's what money is.

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:57.260 align:middle line:10%
It's the ultimate tool to
keep people doing something

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.810 align:middle line:10%
that is lacking in authenticity.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.390 align:middle line:84%
They do things because,
well, I need the money.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing it for
the money, right?

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I know I shouldn't be doing
this, but we need the money.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.150 align:middle line:10%
I know I shouldn't be
buying this chicken that's

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:13.137 align:middle line:10%
been pumped with
antibiotics, but it's cheap.

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:14.720 align:middle line:10%
And I only have a
little bit of money,

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.120 align:middle line:10%
and I've got three kids to feed.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:20.880 align:middle line:10%
So money is a way of
keeping that paradigm going

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.860 align:middle line:10%
for longer and
longer and longer.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
move away from it

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:28.920 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all, to use your
money only locally, right?

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So as far as possible,
use cash locally.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.920 align:middle line:84%
As far as possible,
use a credit union.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Don't bank with a big bank.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:39.330 align:middle line:10%
When you give your
money to a big bank,

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:43.240 align:middle line:10%
you're giving them money to
kill brown people faraway

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.220 align:middle line:10%
in distant lands.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:48.570 align:middle line:10%
That's what they do, all
of them, with that money.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:52.060 align:middle line:90%
A credit union doesn't do that.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:55.700 align:middle line:10%
They use the money locally in
a more conscientious, human,

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.280 align:middle line:10%
and peaceful way.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing, you
could be radical and say,

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.280 align:middle line:90%
let's not do that.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.810 align:middle line:10%
Let's do town banking.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.140 align:middle line:10%
Let's do bartering.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:10%
Let's move away from the
system completely and buy

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.924 align:middle line:10%
this piece of land somewhere
and not-- you could do that.

00:47:07.924 --> 00:47:09.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And maybe
it needs to be

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.020 align:middle line:10%
a hybridized version
of all of it.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.240 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And I've been to
communities that do that.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.590 align:middle line:10%
Some of them work well, some
of them do not work well.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.970 align:middle line:10%
I've also seen places
that declare themselves

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.420 align:middle line:10%
as a sovereign principality,
or whatever you call it.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.970 align:middle line:10%
A sovereign state,
completely separate,

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:26.930 align:middle line:10%
with different laws and
different expectations.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen that in
Montreal, that was.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:29.970 align:middle line:90%
That was interesting.

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:31.510 align:middle line:90%
But it has its challenges.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.270 align:middle line:10%
For me personally, and for
probably most of your audience,

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:37.360 align:middle line:10%
I would say, begin to
take the money away

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.460 align:middle line:10%
from the people who are using
it in a destructive sense.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Draw it back to you, personally.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And draw it back out of
that system as best you can.

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.430 align:middle line:10%
Then, when you do things locally
and with friends and family

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:54.060 align:middle line:10%
and community and colleagues and
associates and acquaintances,

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.530 align:middle line:10%
try not to use money.

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:58.150 align:middle line:10%
Try not to have that involved.

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.349 align:middle line:10%
Exchange skills and
knowledge instead.

00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:01.390 align:middle line:10%
That's what I try and do.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:03.973 align:middle line:84%
So rather than someone saying,
I'll do that for $20, yeah, no.

00:48:03.973 --> 00:48:05.080 align:middle line:90%
It does not require money.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll fix your computer
that you've got a virus

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and all your files are messed
up, I'll fix that for you.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.200 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.950 align:middle line:10%
I'm not very good at
putting shelves up.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:13.950 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you could help me.

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:14.530 align:middle line:10%
I'll do that.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:15.272 align:middle line:10%
I love wood work.

00:48:15.272 --> 00:48:17.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No, and it's so much
more personal and rewarding.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:19.271 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And it's
simple to do that.

00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:24.710 align:middle line:10%
And the other thing is to
consider the system of exchange

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:30.890 align:middle line:10%
is based upon a conscious
decision to disempower.

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:34.430 align:middle line:10%
So you have to realize that
you are still taking part

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:36.170 align:middle line:10%
in a process of disempowerment.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:39.900 align:middle line:10%
That is our consent every
time we use that dollar bill,

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.770 align:middle line:10%
that pound note, we are
consenting to empire.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:46.880 align:middle line:10%
You have to realize
that you are, however

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.230 align:middle line:10%
conscious, going to Whole
Foods and buying your bloody,

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:53.120 align:middle line:10%
you know, organic kale things.

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.740 align:middle line:10%
Crisps, what are crisps?

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.407 align:middle line:10%
Say, your chips.

00:48:55.407 --> 00:48:56.823 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
we have those too.

00:48:56.823 --> 00:48:58.350 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: That's
nice, that's OK.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:01.390 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, every
time you use that thing,

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.300 align:middle line:10%
you're doing something
weird with it.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.940 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting to see
what Bitcoin is doing.

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:08.290 align:middle line:10%
These cryptocurrencies.

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Many countries are
scared to death of it.

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Some of the smarter ones
are saying, well, OK.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.040 align:middle line:10%
We'll control how
that works, and we'll

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:19.000 align:middle line:10%
crush it and float it and
expand it and diminish

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.740 align:middle line:10%
it as necessary.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.520 align:middle line:10%
That's interesting, though.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.050 align:middle line:10%
Bitcoin is an interesting
thing to take a look at.

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:30.210 align:middle line:10%
It's very easy, in my opinion,
to sequester it and take over.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:33.190 align:middle line:10%
But at the moment, it is
quite wild west and free,

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:34.690 align:middle line:10%
which I think is
really interesting.

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.182 align:middle line:10%
So I would encourage people to--

00:49:36.182 --> 00:49:37.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Look into it.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:37.380 align:middle line:10%
Study Bitcoin.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.879 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Look into
Bitcoin and look

00:49:38.879 --> 00:49:40.920 align:middle line:10%
into its foundation,
its principle.

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.010 align:middle line:10%
Understand what
a block chain is.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.740 align:middle line:10%
Understand how
its representation

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:10%
has no, by design, relationship
to any material wealth.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.400 align:middle line:10%
It's just a system of exchange.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.960 align:middle line:10%
It's not promising anything.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.240 align:middle line:10%
There's no gold
necessary for this.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.600 align:middle line:10%
It's just a system of
theoretical exchange, which

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.400 align:middle line:10%
is the first time I
think that's happened.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't think we've seen
that in modern history.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.920 align:middle line:10%
So that's interesting.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:08.740 align:middle line:10%
For me, the starting
point is to consider

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.800 align:middle line:10%
what you do with your money
in terms of not having

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.507 align:middle line:10%
it safeguarded by banks who
use it for other things.

00:50:15.507 --> 00:50:16.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:17.710 align:middle line:90%
And we can all make that choice.

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:18.120 align:middle line:90%
We can all make that choice.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That's
really important.

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:20.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not that difficult.

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if
it's that simple,

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.615 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only thing
we do, that's a big choice.

00:50:22.615 --> 00:50:24.650 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: If you bank with
a big bank, every time

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:26.108 align:middle line:10%
you get your wallet
out and you see

00:50:26.108 --> 00:50:30.560 align:middle line:10%
that card in there, that card
is a consent to destruction

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.110 align:middle line:10%
in foreign lands.

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:34.820 align:middle line:10%
Put that card away,
go find another one,

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.320 align:middle line:10%
and then when you've
shifted your resources over,

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.610 align:middle line:10%
then you can destroy that.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.040 align:middle line:10%
Make that simple step now.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.320 align:middle line:10%
It makes a huge difference.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:41.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:42.700 align:middle line:10%
It makes a lot of sense.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:42.930 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Massive.

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:43.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Massive.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.450 align:middle line:10%
And it also helps to
ultimately take the power away

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:49.740 align:middle line:10%
and dissipate the power
completely of those banking

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:49.860 align:middle line:10%
structures.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:50.080 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: It does.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:50.350 align:middle line:10%
It makes life difficult.

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:51.820 align:middle line:10%
It makes life very difficult.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.611 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I have one
question left for you,

00:50:53.611 --> 00:50:55.030 align:middle line:10%
because we're
almost out of time.

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do more
with a living philosophy

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.840 align:middle line:84%
that I know you're
really big on.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is, will you
explain to us the beauty,

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.130 align:middle line:84%
and really the
necessity if we're

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:07.420 align:middle line:84%
to take back our
own sovereignty,

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.490 align:middle line:90%
in becoming lifelong students.

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:11.650 align:middle line:90%
Renaissance people.

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.840 align:middle line:10%
When you're involved in
spiritual development,

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.630 align:middle line:10%
you become involved in also
didacticism, which is just

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.960 align:middle line:10%
simply a posh word
for teaching yourself

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.850 align:middle line:10%
through the course of your life
about the nature of reality.

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:29.770 align:middle line:10%
So the auto didactic impulse
is something very precious,

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:33.130 align:middle line:10%
which is that you can teach
yourself better than anybody.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:34.860 align:middle line:10%
And when you need
specialist knowledge,

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.310 align:middle line:10%
you might go and get that.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.640 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the Renaissance
man, the Renaissance woman,

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.220 align:middle line:84%
the polymath, is
to say that wisdom

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is hidden all over
different territories, all

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.550 align:middle line:90%
over different landscapes.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:47.480 align:middle line:10%
And you have to
become proficient

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.040 align:middle line:10%
in many, many things.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.786 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- the joy of it is
that it's pleasurable to learn.

00:51:53.786 --> 00:51:55.910 align:middle line:10%
And you realize that rather
than it being something

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:59.410 align:middle line:10%
that is aimed towards
you getting a job,

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:01.430 align:middle line:10%
drawing a paycheck,
it's actually

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:middle line:10%
for the pleasure and the
insight that it gives you

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.700 align:middle line:10%
with regard to
understanding yourself

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.730 align:middle line:10%
and your relationship
with reality.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:11.100 align:middle line:10%
So as people engage
with that, they

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:15.820 align:middle line:10%
come to understand that learning
is spiritual development.

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:21.750 align:middle line:10%
It's treating yourself,
self, S-E-L-F, self,

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:24.550 align:middle line:10%
as the instrument
for your own growth.

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Not as something on a page.

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:31.211 align:middle line:84%
But you become the marker for
your own spiritual engagement

00:52:31.211 --> 00:52:31.710 align:middle line:90%
with life.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:35.330 align:middle line:10%
And that comes
automatically when

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:40.510 align:middle line:10%
you put learning number
one in your daily life.

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:41.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:43.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what else
is there to life

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.270 align:middle line:10%
but to gain as much
experience as you can.

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:47.800 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And in
your relationships,

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.070 align:middle line:10%
and in your food, and in your
friendships, and in your home,

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:54.440 align:middle line:10%
and in the decorations in
your home, and in the things

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.770 align:middle line:10%
that you put in your mouth.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Bring that learning and
that wisdom into every area.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:59.860 align:middle line:90%
And soak it up.

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.811 align:middle line:10%
Neil, it's been a
pleasure sitting with you

00:53:02.811 --> 00:53:04.460 align:middle line:10%
the last couple of
hours, as always.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.427 align:middle line:10%
And of course, we're
going to do this again.

00:53:06.427 --> 00:53:07.260 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Thank you.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:07.440 align:middle line:10%
It's been a pleasure.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So thank you so much.

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:09.650 align:middle line:10%
You're such a clear thinker.

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:10.233 align:middle line:10%
So articulate.

00:53:10.233 --> 00:53:13.786 align:middle line:10%
And I know our viewers have
very much been enjoying you.

00:53:13.786 --> 00:53:15.810 align:middle line:10%
As Neil's explained
so well, if we

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.390 align:middle line:10%
don't like the
illusion of empire,

00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:19.230 align:middle line:10%
we need to consciously
engage in our choices

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:21.960 align:middle line:10%
and in our lives, as you
just said, in every way.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.520 align:middle line:84%
