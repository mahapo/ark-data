>>REGINA MEREDITH: Though
the hoopla over 2012

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:10%
is long gone with none of the
feared events having occurred,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:10%
the silent Long Count
continues in its effects.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:84%
According to Carl Calleman,
we can mark the development

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:84%
of our individual and collective
consciousness, or global mind,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.850 align:middle line:84%
through the stages
of the Long Count.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:84%
When did the human mind leap
from chaotic and dreamlike

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:90%
to clear and focused?

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
What was transpiring
on Earth at that time?

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Carl is with us today to
explain the development

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
of the mind in accordance
with the Mayan calendar, which

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
he says was the point,
not a linear time count.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Carl.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL CALLEMAN:
Thank you so much.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.869 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
completely different view

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan calendar than
what is generally proposed.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: I think so.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:10%
You know, I've been adamant
that the Mayan calendar

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:10%
is about a metaphysical reality
that sort of determines life

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:10%
also in the physical sense.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness is
primary to matter.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:10%
And that's the only reason I
can see that the Maya actually

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:10%
saw this as a
prophetic calendar,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:10%
something that was
linked to the gods

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.791 align:middle line:10%
and something that could tell
the shifting ages and so forth.

00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you think happened

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that created the rather
popular belief in modern times

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that this was a literal calendar
that marked the end of history?

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah,
that's the funny thing

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing in
the Mayan scriptures that

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:90%
talks about that.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But some-- originally,
it was actually

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
an archaeologist that
came up with the idea

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:84%
that this would be the end
of the world, so to speak.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And somehow a lot of people seem
to have been wired that way.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And it just came out that way,
and it's not from the Maya.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let me ask you this

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.144 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about global mind

00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:90%
and global consciousness.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
What was it in our
collective mindset that

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to grab on
to such fearful notions

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and run with it?

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
That's-- part of my
understanding of the Mayan

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.405 align:middle line:84%
calendar is that it is different
polarities of the mind.

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Like what is talked
about in the Bible

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
as the tree of knowledge
of good and evil.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like the mind has shadows.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And whenever these
shadows come to dominate,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and whenever people are not
able to see the shadows,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:90%
they tend to act them out.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: We act it out in
our personal relationships.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, we may be jealous,
we may be comparing ourself

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to others and all
these kind of things.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
On a larger scale,
these shadows tend

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
to create a very negative
view of-- have, historically

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
speaking, created negative
views of other nations,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:84%
other civilizations,
other races and so forth.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And actually this is all part of
a global mind that we download.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
something coming from us.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a global mind.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
think there were

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
external forces so to speak, or
external forms of consciousness

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that were kind of programming
that fearful or negative aspect

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:90%
of the 2012 agenda?

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Or was that all organic?

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Did that all come from us?

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I think it
mostly came from us.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
But I also think there might
have been strong interest

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
on the part of the
power structures

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
on our planet to discredit the
Mayan calendar, to have people

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:84%
not study this thing seriously
because it tells us so

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
much about what it is to be
a human being, where we come

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
from, how our civilization has
originated, and we're going.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So to simplify it
and then make it very emotional

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
with this horrific outcome would
essentially shoo people away

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.012 align:middle line:90%
from any serious--

00:04:30.012 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.886 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -reflection on it.

00:04:31.886 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I think that's
absolutely what has happened.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now is
it wise of us to just

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:84%
dismiss the whole
thing then, because now

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that we all lived through
it, nobody died, I

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:90%
mean nothing happened.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.226 align:middle line:84%
Well, except people who were
going to die anyway that day,

00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
but I mean, we're
all still here.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it unwise to just
dismiss now the Mayan calendar

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
or is its effects still
worth our attention?

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I think absolutely
for anyone who seriously wants

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to understand the human
condition, so to speak,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
what life is all about and also
where it's going in the future,

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that person has to study
the Mayan calendar.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
There is no other really
scientifically verified time

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
schedule for how life has
been evolving and does so.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that the kind of
evidence from history that's

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
available regarding the
Mayan calendar is massive.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like unprecedented.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
There's no need for
any further evidence

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that this is the-- it
describes the evolution

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:90%
of human civilization.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And that by itself
is of great interest.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's also that it's
pointing a new wave.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
waves of evolution, nine

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to be exact in the
Mayan calendar system.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And a new wave was
activated in 2011.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.100 align:middle line:90%
The highest of the waves.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is a wave that people
should be aware of because it--

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:84%
not in a negative sense, but
also-- because it gives us

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful new opportunity.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not like paradise
comes overnight.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But what it is, is
that it's something

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that holds the promise to--
that for the first time

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:84%
in human history we
may be able to download

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:84%
a new kind of mind that doesn't
separate, that doesn't judge.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Et
cetera, et cetera.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't been
possible until that point.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Now it is--

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
saying that--

00:06:53.535 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: -possible.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -point was the
beginning of something,

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:90%
not the end?

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.068 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:06:57.068 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so a few months
before Jose Arguelles died,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I had a chance to sit with him
and talk and do an interview.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things he said, which

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I found interesting at the
time because it's not something

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that he talked about,
but I had to ask.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:84%
He said that the
Mayan calendar was

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:84%
a more kind of organic view of
the cycles of the consciousness

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And that the Gregorian
calendar, which we live by,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:84%
was essentially planted
here by some other beings,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:84%
some other species, which
was in direct conflict

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
to our natural rhythms and
flows and waves in the day

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and night of our
evolution as a species,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:84%
to essentially interrupt
and create this disconnect,

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:90%
even on a time level.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Now what do you think of that?

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I don't-- I
mean, I agree partially, yes.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we have this
Gregorian calendar, which

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
is really what I would
call a materialist rather

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:84%
than a metaphysical
calendar, so that blocks us

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
from understanding
the-- from downloading

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:84%
the new possibilities
from the divine reality.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.972 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
saying that, too.

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
we do it every day.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
When we made this
agreement to meet here,

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:90%
we used the Gregorian calendar.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Everything is made by that.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's made
from what I would

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
say a materialist worldview,
a materialist calendar.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:90%
And that is an impediment to us.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would not
believe that there

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
was some sort of not--
I would say rather it's

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
been a long time when, according
to this divine time plan,

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:84%
there has been
shadows of the mind,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and that is what has
blocked us from using

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
a true metaphysical
calendar, like the Maya.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.564 align:middle line:84%
So I would give another
explanation to why--

00:09:03.564 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just so
you know, that's

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
not something he ever
talked about publicly.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But I just got this
kind of instinct

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to ask him in the
moment and he said,

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it did
come from elsewhere.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.505 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a product of us.

00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: OK.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that--
that's certainly not

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:84%
what he was known
for as his position,

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and this was just before he
died and he just said it.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.935 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:09:23.935 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I thought, well,
that's kind of interesting.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.112 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing
for consideration.

00:09:28.112 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's from
our shadow or a shadow

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
from beyond
influencing our shadow,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.450 align:middle line:84%
the point is you're
saying that it interrupts

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:84%
this direct ability to flow
with the consciousness of a more

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.832 align:middle line:84%
organic, a
metaphysical calendar?

00:09:40.832 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.177 align:middle line:84%
And then, you just
mentioned a moment ago,

00:09:46.177 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:84%
which I'm sure some people heard
and thought wait, wait, wait,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
you got to go back
to that, which

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
was that the Mayan calendar
made its shift actually

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.902 align:middle line:84%
not in December 21, 2012,
but October 28, 2011.

00:09:59.902 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
had an experience

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:90%
with this at the time.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes, I did.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell
us why that date

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what your
experience of it was.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well,
for the first I

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:84%
think it-- if you know the
Mayan calendar in many cycles

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and how they
intervolve, and there

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:84%
was something very strange
about the December 21 date.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
In the sacred calendar, it was 4
light and any significant shift

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:84%
date like that
should've been 13 light.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the reasons why not.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But if you remember
the year 2011,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
it was a year that Time
Magazine at the end of it

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:84%
called the year
of the protester.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when this
ninth wave was activated,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.104 align:middle line:90%
the highest wave that--

00:11:05.104 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
was October 28, 2011?

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.395 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: No.

00:11:07.395 --> 00:11:08.755 align:middle line:90%
It was activated in March.

00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, in
March, right OK.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.419 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: -of 2011.

00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And then suddenly,
there is the Arab Spring,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:84%
it's the Occupy Movement, and
almost everywhere in the world

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
people are protesting against
various forms of oppression.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And my way of looking
at that is that this

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:84%
is a result of the
shadows going away,

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:84%
or the people are
seeing through something

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
they did not see
through previously.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.324 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fukushima.

00:11:44.324 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fukushima also.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.943 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Exactly.

00:11:45.943 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
It happened almost on
that particular date.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
It happened two days after the--
And that also became a time

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.787 align:middle line:84%
when people woke up, and
alarm bells so to speak--

00:11:56.787 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: -on seeing
things in a new way, what

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
is really important about
our planet and so forth.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think this,
in many ways, this

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:84%
has been verified
that, indeed, that's

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
the time when the big
awakening, at least visibly,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.994 align:middle line:90%
happened on our planet.

00:12:20.994 --> 00:12:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: The year 2012,
pretty much nothing happened

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.684 align:middle line:90%
that was so dramatic like--

00:12:25.684 --> 00:12:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.154 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: -2011.

00:12:27.154 --> 00:12:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that was the
beginning of the ninth wave?

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes, exactly.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:38.186 align:middle line:84%
And that is running on and
continuing into eternity,

00:12:38.186 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:90%
as far as I can tell.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So explain
in some detail

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:84%
the characteristics
of what we now

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
have access to that we didn't
before within the global mind,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and what we should be ideally
choosing to connect with

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and experience as
a result of this?

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Right.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, what this
book is about is really

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:90%
to outline how history looks.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
If you see it as a
product that-- if you

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
see the human mind
as a product of us

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
humans downloading
from a global mind,

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and this global mind
evolves according

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:90%
to a set time plan of its own.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And basically for
5,000 years, which

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
is described in
this book, humanity

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
has been developed with a
mind that has been polarized,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.740 align:middle line:90%
like dark-light so to speak.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And that has helped us to
create this civilization.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
That has helped us to create
technology, language, writing,

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and mathematics,
and all these things

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that we associate
with civilization.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:04.560 align:middle line:84%
But the flip side of it is that
also this darkness on one side

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.190 align:middle line:84%
has made us do these
comparisons, separating people

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
into classes of people,
separating genders, separating

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:90%
races, and so forth.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
That is something that's
inherent in that kind

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
of a mind that has
created our civilization.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just good, it's
not just bad, basically.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But what has happened since
that activation in early 2011

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:84%
is the possibility to
download a mind that

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a shadow.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I put in
to that is that it

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
means a possibility for a
direct and stable contact

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:90%
with the divine.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Guiding us in the time
ahead to a world not

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.220 align:middle line:84%
based on separation,
based on unity.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing ourselves in
everybody else and vice versa.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if our entire
existence has been exploring

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:84%
these, as you call them,
spiritual imprints and also

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.132 align:middle line:90%
holograms--

00:15:10.132 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -the other
area of thought

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:84%
is that we are co-creators
of those holograms.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:84%
We're feeding into
at the same time

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.552 align:middle line:90%
we're drawing down from, right?

00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the quality
of what we have access

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to in the global
mind, isn't that

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
dependent upon our own
maturation and desire,

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and enough people kind of
reaching that tipping point

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
or lighting up to feed into
that hologram, so to speak,

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:84%
for us to then
download en masse?

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.057 align:middle line:84%
And I think, ultimately,
it is a choice also.

00:15:44.057 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And I think
these different polarities

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
of the mind that
exist, some people have

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:middle line:84%
one type of polarity,
others download another.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's very
important thing to know.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:84%
That it is a
choice, so to speak,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.225 align:middle line:90%
what we choose to download.

00:16:10.225 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:90%
But that--

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're saying
kind of more cosmically,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like, more
cosmically the global mind

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:84%
has had the potential through
whatever cosmic events,

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:84%
the passage of time,
to elevate itself

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.290 align:middle line:84%
to this field of non-polarity
for us to tap into,

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and we can kind of
co-create within that?

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.577 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: I think now we can.

00:16:31.577 --> 00:16:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.118 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Before not.

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:34.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:34.295 --> 00:16:34.795 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:16:34.795 --> 00:16:36.129 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Before not.

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about-- now we're

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
talking about a divine
mind, so to speak.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
You liken the global mind
to the iCloud, right?

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.625 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: To what?

00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like the
cloud for computing.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Oh, the cloud.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:49.814 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:49.814 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at
the cloud in computing,

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
give us the analogy between
that technological example

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and how the global
mind works with us.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, you know, I
think that 5,125 years ago when

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:84%
the so-called Long Count
began, then a new hologram

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:90%
could be downloaded.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:84%
And now, if you want to make
the comparison to computer

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
programs, it's like
downloading the program Word.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Before 5,130 years
ago, they hadn't

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.754 align:middle line:84%
released the mind-- the
mind 1.0, so to speak.

00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Then they-- they in
this divine plan so to speak,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.050 align:middle line:90%
released that mind.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't mean that
everyone thinks the same thing.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like if there are billions
of people properly using

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
the Word program, but they
write different things on it.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
thing with the mind,

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:84%
that people make different
things from the mind.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But there is an
ultimate structure,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
a geometric structure
of the mind that

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
was common to all people that
5,000 years ago downloaded it.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And that caused the possibility
of creating civilizations,

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
but also for people to
understand each other

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
to the extent that they were
using this mind version 1.0.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And once you're
using that, you start

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to have all kinds of
synchronicities and things

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:84%
are-- people get coordinated
in their activities.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.866 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when they
built the big pyramids.

00:18:52.866 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
becomes more linear?

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: More linear, yeah.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:90%
The structured lines, geometry--

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:90%
Became more linear at that time.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes. yes.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.046 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, we
look back to pagan times,

00:19:06.046 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
we look back to
prehistoric times

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
where the configurations of
a lot of the sacred sites,

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.092 align:middle line:84%
the buildings, the dolmonds,
et cetera, were all circular.

00:19:14.092 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're talking
about a leap from essentially

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:84%
circular, which you have
depicted in your book as having

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:27.490 align:middle line:84%
a more dreamlike, more chaotic,
but more dreamlike kind of mind

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:90%
into--

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.865 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Shamanic.

00:19:28.865 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes,
more shamanic mind,

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:35.352 align:middle line:84%
into this linear mind
with right angles.

00:19:35.352 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right-angled thinking,
right-angled architecture,

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.950 align:middle line:84%
ultimately leading into
more left brain thinking,

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
patriarchal concepts
and so forth.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it's-- you
know, it's fascinating.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
In one of these sites in
Syria where they can actually

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.200 align:middle line:84%
study archaeologically,
there is one layer

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
where the house
foundations are circular.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes one point
when instead it's perpendicular.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: So now where
did that come from?

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:84%
There are no straight lines
in nature, so what I'm saying,

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
it must have been a hologram
that they downloaded,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and I also argue from where
it actually came from.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, the mind was
changed at that point.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's make it perpendicular.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
real reason for it,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
except for if there is some
kind of an inner change.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.560 align:middle line:84%
It's no advantage
necessarily to have

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
perpendicular corners
in your house.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:90%
You live equally--

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.588 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some would say not.

00:20:42.588 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes,
some would say not.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:10%
Because maybe in our
own times there's

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.880 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people
that do not really

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.862 align:middle line:10%
like what we call civilization.

00:20:51.862 --> 00:20:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would
you say it might

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
be more a function of having
moved from a circular, more

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.530 align:middle line:84%
feminine energy and way
of being and thinking

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and societal construction
to a masculine?

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:84%
That's probably what
happened 5,100 years ago.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Feminine,
as far as we know,

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's certainly many
of the very oldest statuettes

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that humans did
like 40, 50 thousand years ago,

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.840 align:middle line:90%
they were females.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So that probably
signifies something.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.857 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, it's hard to
know the details in prehistory.

00:21:26.857 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were saying, and you

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:90%
said several times, they, OK.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Whoever they are that programmed
that particular global mind.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Who programs the global
mind, the divine mind?

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I think
it is the divine.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.336 align:middle line:90%
That's all I would say.

00:21:41.336 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.418 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what the name is.

00:21:43.418 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:90%
There's a--

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: It's
something beyond

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.214 align:middle line:84%
my logical comprehension,
so I'm not going to try.

00:21:49.214 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
just say we can

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.977 align:middle line:84%
call it divine spirit,
divine mind, divine whatever.

00:21:52.977 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Divine spirit, mind.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there is
some kind of intelligence

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that you're saying through
these kind of shifts

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and epochs allows
for possibility

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:90%
under that particular imprint.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So now we've been under
5,125 years, or 26, 27,

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:90%
28 years now--

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.273 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Something
like that, yeah.

00:22:12.273 --> 00:22:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -under
this very angular,

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.027 align:middle line:84%
linear construct,
and the advantages

00:22:17.027 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
are what you mentioned
earlier, right?

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.420 align:middle line:84%
We have the development of
science, structures, society,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:90%
cities.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, our cities are laid
out in these little grids.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.481 align:middle line:84%
You know, A, B, C,
one, two, three.

00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Mm-hm.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not very
creative in a lot

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.990 align:middle line:84%
of cases, but there you
go, we have structure.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So now what is the
possibility to move away

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:90%
from that structure?

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
What can it look
like if we move away

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.377 align:middle line:90%
from this linear, angular epoch?

00:22:42.377 --> 00:22:43.085 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:22:43.085 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I think a completely new world.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot foresee
the details of it,

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.770 align:middle line:84%
but I do see the possibility,
and I really have experienced

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that myself also in the past
few years regarding this unity

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, this possibility
of connecting more directly

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.186 align:middle line:90%
to the divine.

00:23:12.186 --> 00:23:12.852 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:23:12.852 --> 00:23:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And once
that is more established

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.410 align:middle line:84%
on a larger scale,
because it will just

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:84%
increase in possibility,
once that, then we

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:35.180 align:middle line:84%
will see the new ways of
creating a world of unity.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:84%
This mind, it sort
of determines how

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.400 align:middle line:84%
we see reality, how
we perceive reality.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And then when we think that we
know what the reality is like,

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:84%
then we try to create a
reality along those lines.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:90%
And now that is changing.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you say in the
book that in each of these time

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:84%
periods, for example, it was
understood in Egyptian times

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:90%
that a new god would come in.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:84%
When we say god, it can
be a big G, little g,

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:84%
but a new entity would come in
with advanced knowledge that

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:84%
would seed the population
with knowledge.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And, for example,
you say that Horace

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
was one god at a particular
time that was seated.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you say that,
what do you perceive

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of that
seating was at that time?

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I think it is just
part of a divine plan going

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
from the original unity,
the shamanistic unity,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
through structure creating
this world with straight lines

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.382 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:24:42.382 --> 00:24:43.007 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:43.007 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And then
going through that.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And why that is
the divine plan, I

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:90%
don't know, because I'm not God.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so
Quetzalcoatl, for example,

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:10%
came in and was credited
with very specific teachings

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.880 align:middle line:10%
to the people on the
planet at that time,

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:10%
and there's a lot of lore,
mythology, shamanistic

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:10%
interpretation of
what Quetzalcoatl was.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm seeing
here is you're

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.549 align:middle line:90%
talking about physical beings?

00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: No, I think--

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.006 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or just
god-like beings?

00:25:11.006 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I only think
of metaphysical beings.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
metaphysical beings

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.500 align:middle line:84%
that were coming as
emissaries and as go-betweens

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.142 align:middle line:84%
between the divine
mind and the people?

00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in what
you're saying now,

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:84%
it would seem to me that we
would be-- theoretically,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:84%
we should be seeing
the end of religions

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:90%
in which there is a go-between.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: I think so.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't
think-- I don't

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:84%
think there's anything wrong
with religion by itself.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But the religions
that now exist have

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:84%
been created by this
kind of a mind that

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:90%
had this polarizing structure.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And that has put its mark
on all of these religions

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.854 align:middle line:90%
of the past 5,000 years.

00:25:53.854 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And
as a consequence,

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I think much of what has been
ideas from these religions no

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
longer will be relevant, because
they're created by another kind

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.917 align:middle line:90%
of mind--

00:26:09.917 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: -than is now.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
intermediaries made

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:84%
people feel
spiritually disabled,

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
like you didn't have
your own access.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Right.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that's what should be--

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: That's
very important.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.652 align:middle line:84%
We should be transitioning
to our own connection now.

00:26:23.652 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Absolutely.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:90%
So as--

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.251 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: That's the
main message, I would say.

00:26:27.251 --> 00:26:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk about
what happened in the last wave.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.679 align:middle line:84%
What was happening--
give us an idea

00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:35.470 align:middle line:84%
so we know what was
happening on Earth when

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:39.370 align:middle line:84%
we, for example, went from
the fourth-- let's start

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.680 align:middle line:84%
with the fourth-- fourth,
fifth, sixth, seventh,

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:90%
and eighth waves.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
What was going on
historically at that time?

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So we can see some
precedence for the reality

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:84%
of how it anchored into global
mind versus where we are now.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: OK, so
the fourth wave.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.619 align:middle line:84%
No, say the fifth wave
basically started--

00:26:57.619 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: -about
100,000 years ago.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And we know that 100,000 years
ago people, for the first time,

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:84%
started to bury their
dead ceremonially.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that they
probably had some sense

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.070 align:middle line:90%
that there was a soul.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just sort of like
previous more like animal

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:22.910 align:middle line:84%
like species, but these
people then had a soul.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And we also see that
for the first time,

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.710 align:middle line:90%
they start to make art.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
They start to
decorate themselves

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:90%
with colors and so forth.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.017 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that they are
starting to go out--

00:27:35.017 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sense
something more divine.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes,
something more divine.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And also for themselves not
just to be animals in nature,

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:43.909 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Then 5,000
years ago-- then this

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:84%
evolved through the whole time,
but then comes the sixth wave

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:58.130 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago when people
download a polarized mind

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:90%
with straight lines.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And so, they start to
build straight pyramids.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.660 align:middle line:90%
They start to write.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:90%
They start to count.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:84%
They start to do
everything like that.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And then comes the seventh
wave, which is 1755.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when
people basically

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.992 align:middle line:84%
abandoned all
spirituality altogether.

00:28:20.992 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Going back into
the scientific materialism.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, right.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:24.690 align:middle line:90%
It's full--

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:25.892 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Algebra.

00:28:25.892 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:90%
But also industry.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
The steam engine and
locomotives, and everything

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.240 align:middle line:84%
starts 17-- nothing
is before 1755.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a
shift in the mind

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and people are
starting to create

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:90%
their industrial reality.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Then comes the
eighth level, which

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:53.540 align:middle line:84%
is in 1999, and that's when
internet becomes interactive

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and we're starting to see
a big shift in the world

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.950 align:middle line:84%
economy towards the
eastern hemisphere.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.822 align:middle line:90%
That's because the hemispheres--

00:29:01.822 --> 00:29:03.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to get into that next,

00:29:03.655 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:90%
the hemispheres.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, OK.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:05.435 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: OK.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2011 comes
finally this wave

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have any
shadows, and that's

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:90%
where we are beginning.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But they're all-- that's one
thing I need to emphasize.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.570 align:middle line:84%
They're all running, they're
all continuing, so to speak.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they
replace each other.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.860 align:middle line:84%
It's more like
the Mayan pyramids

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:84%
were built on top of
one another, the levels.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.730 align:middle line:84%
They activated on
top of another.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And as a new wave is activated,
the older ones are continuing.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But the highest
frequency is usually

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:84%
the one that takes over
and becomes the dominant.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:50.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which would be
indicative of nonlinear time,

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:50.655 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:51.321 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes.

00:29:51.321 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that--
yes, that makes sense.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we get into
the notion of the brain.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.492 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The right
and left hemispheres.

00:29:59.492 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The east and the west.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to tell us the
story of how this connects

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:10.150 align:middle line:84%
with the Earth's core, the
crystalline and the more

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.366 align:middle line:84%
molten nature, with
our deep psychology

00:30:13.366 --> 00:30:14.990 align:middle line:84%
in the eastern and
western hemispheres,

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:84%
because that's really a very
brilliant part of your book

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that's completely,
I mean, fresh to me.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:21.121 align:middle line:90%
I've not seen this before.

00:30:21.121 --> 00:30:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: No, and
it's very significant.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:10%
And it's also very-- the final
evidence really came just

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.700 align:middle line:10%
after this 2011 thing,
so it's a new thing.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:90%
It comes out of this new--

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just go ahead
and launch in and tells us

00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
the story and
explain this to us.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, the
story is that for 20 years,

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I've been saying that the
human brain where we associate

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.630 align:middle line:84%
certain qualities with the
left brain half, like logic,

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:56.460 align:middle line:84%
mathematics, and certain other
qualities with the right brain

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.762 align:middle line:90%
half, more like intuition--

00:30:58.762 --> 00:31:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Creativity.

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: -creativity, and
holistic thinking, so to speak.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I've said that this is
a mirror of the Earth

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.850 align:middle line:84%
being a western and
an eastern hemisphere.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Because historically
speaking, the west

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.420 align:middle line:84%
have been the sort of the
driving part of the world when

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:26.180 align:middle line:84%
it comes to structure
and so forth.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And you may only think of how
different the types of medicine

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:84%
have been in the
east and the west.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The west has been go to the
target organ of something

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.610 align:middle line:90%
that is sick.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the east
has been holistic,

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.250 align:middle line:84%
let's look at the whole
system, so to speak.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, already
in 1994, I said

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:84%
that there is a line here
that distinguishes these two

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.160 align:middle line:90%
mentalities.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Not like-- Not like
it's completely

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:90%
different on both sides.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:84%
But there is a line where
basically you can say so.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A geographical line--

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: A
geographical line--

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.578 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -which
runs through Rome.

00:32:07.578 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: -that runs
though Rome and Berlin.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.093 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:10.093 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And it
goes down to Capetown

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:90%
and goes up to North Pole.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And there I've said, this
is where the line goes

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and this is why the ancient
peoples put so much emphasis

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.910 align:middle line:84%
on the four directions,
because they are actually

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.930 align:middle line:84%
creating different energies
in different directions.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did this work?

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
look at that line,

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:84%
it really isn't
like a straight line

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:43.880 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the
Earth because Italy

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:84%
doesn't look like a straight
line or anything like that.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But I left that
to be, basically.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But I could see through the
Mayan calendar, absolutely,

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.250 align:middle line:90%
there is a line here.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And then what came in
2011-- late in 2011

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:12.530 align:middle line:84%
was this discovery by French
geophysicists-- people studying

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:84%
the interior of the
Earth-- who found

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that exactly on that longitude
that I had predicted,

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
there is actually a shift in
the inner core of the Earth

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.580 align:middle line:84%
so that on the
western side of that--

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.230 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
everything west of Rome,

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.330 align:middle line:84%
there is a more
crystalline structure

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.400 align:middle line:84%
of the surface of
this inner core.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Whereas east of it, you have a
more smooth, melted structure

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.070 align:middle line:84%
of the surface of the
inner core of the Earth.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is an enormously
important thing,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:84%
especially since it
correlates exactly

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.520 align:middle line:84%
with the predictions
from the Mayan calendar,

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:84%
because it means that our minds
are connected to the Earth,

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:84%
but it's connected primarily
to the inner core of the Earth.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.859 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's a closed case.

00:34:11.859 --> 00:34:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of,
to me, anyway, it

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.560 align:middle line:84%
sets an end to this
long discussion

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.219 align:middle line:84%
whether the mind is a
product of the brain

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:29.370 align:middle line:84%
or if the brain is something
that receives consciousness.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:84%
And it proves without
a doubt, the mind

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.679 align:middle line:90%
is not created by the brain.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.840 align:middle line:84%
The mind is
something we download

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and the inner core
of the Earth is

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.530 align:middle line:84%
part of what we are
downloading in this.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you're
writing about this in the book,

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.822 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
frequency ranges?

00:34:47.822 --> 00:34:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The frequency
ranges of different levels

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:54.524 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
from low delta, you

00:34:54.524 --> 00:34:58.572 align:middle line:84%
know, 2 Hertz so, all the
way up to, I think, 80.

00:34:58.572 --> 00:34:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:34:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:00.276 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:00.276 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Which is very high gamma, right?

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes, exactly.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:03.893 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
let's talk about that

00:35:03.893 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and how-- so people can
get a visualization going

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.450 align:middle line:84%
from the surface of the
Earth through the layers

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to the correlating
levels of consciousness

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.570 align:middle line:84%
so we can kind of get a
picture of how that works.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So somehow now, what--
the nature of this field,

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.950 align:middle line:90%
we don't really know.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.530 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
field, so to speak.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
But we can see that our
minds are definitely

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.800 align:middle line:84%
connected to different
layers or different shells

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:84%
in this system of the Earth
and its surrounding atmosphere.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's been an enigma for a
long time within neurology,

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:52.320 align:middle line:84%
why are there are certain
ranges of brain waves?

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Why can we talk
about the frequencies

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:03.450 align:middle line:84%
between 7 and 13
Hertz as alpha waves?

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they do
find that there is

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:84%
a certain quality
to the state people

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.870 align:middle line:84%
are in when their
brains are disp--

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is-- this
is the resonant frequency

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.770 align:middle line:90%
of the Schumann waves--

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes, it is.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -of the external
part of the planet, right?

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.913 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Exactly.

00:36:17.913 --> 00:36:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So there is a connection
with that level.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is-- that's the
area where we are experiencing

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.482 align:middle line:84%
a relaxed and calm
state and well being.

00:36:27.482 --> 00:36:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.731 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which,
theoretically, if we

00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:32.190 align:middle line:84%
had any connection with
the Earth and walked on it

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.530 align:middle line:84%
or had our shoes off or
were lying in the grass,

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:84%
we should be in
harmony and that would

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.350 align:middle line:84%
make us feel this beautiful,
calm alpha state, right?

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Right.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- I mean, the surface
of the Earth is our home,

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:47.730 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, so when we are
in resonance with the surface,

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:49.647 align:middle line:84%
then we are in resonance
with our home--

00:36:49.647 --> 00:36:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.355 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: -you might say.

00:36:51.355 --> 00:36:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we're relaxed
when our brains are resonating

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.340 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:84%
But then, it's a whole level
of different frequency ranges.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
question has now

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.690 align:middle line:90%
been settled once and for all.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And we know now where these
frequencies come from,

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and we know it--
and we know then

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that a human being has a
consciousness that is connected

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:27.700 align:middle line:84%
to, at least, at the very
least, our entire Earth system.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you're going
to the core of the Earth,

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:84%
if I recall correctly
in the book,

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where you
say you're looking at more

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.079 align:middle line:90%
in the 80 Hertz range--

00:37:35.079 --> 00:37:36.536 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah,
it goes up there.

00:37:36.536 --> 00:37:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -which is
this high gamma state.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.810 align:middle line:84%
What-- I mean, other than
monks who occasionally they

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:84%
can register through various
neurofeedback devices

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and in high gamma,
how does high gamma

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.990 align:middle line:90%
interface with our brains?

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.690 align:middle line:90%
What is our brain doing?

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.989 align:middle line:84%
How often do we even
go into those ranges?

00:37:53.989 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I know when we're
sleeping, we're in low delta,

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.260 align:middle line:84%
but we're not even in
our bodies when we sleep.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So what's actually
going on there?

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well,
that I-- I don't know.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:04.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that the
more relaxed states,

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.850 align:middle line:84%
like you talked about,
the Earth's surface,

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:18.910 align:middle line:84%
they are not the
same as the mind.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:22.164 align:middle line:84%
The structured mind is
actually then the inner core.

00:38:22.164 --> 00:38:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And when you're
in the structured mind,

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:84%
you are not necessarily
in a relaxed state.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.342 align:middle line:90%
I would say you're not.

00:38:29.342 --> 00:38:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: That's
when you-- yeah.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems then
that we are-- depending

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.050 align:middle line:84%
on what we are doing
and what states we

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:84%
want to be in at a
particular point in time,

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.560 align:middle line:84%
our brains is
establishing a connection

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.110 align:middle line:84%
with these different layers
of the Earth's system.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're going
to look at these waves

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.690 align:middle line:84%
again because-- well,
we've touched on it.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:08.270 align:middle line:84%
One thing is in most of the
ancient traditions, religions,

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, day is always
followed by night and so forth.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So the process of
evolution, I mean,

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.220 align:middle line:84%
even if we go--
you know, if we're

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.310 align:middle line:84%
looking at other
traditions as well

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and the calendars there, long
periods of golden age, silver,

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.260 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking at
these cycles of day and night,

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to know where we are.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.060 align:middle line:84%
What we're coming out of,
what we're going into.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.890 align:middle line:84%
What the relevance
of day and night

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.430 align:middle line:84%
is other than activity,
rest, activity, rest?

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.615 align:middle line:84%
Or you might say rise,
decline, rise, decline,

00:39:37.615 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:84%
falls of-- the fall of
civilizations and so forth.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But also your interpretation
of what it Gene-- what

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:84%
meant in Genesis of seven
days and seven nights

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:48.140 align:middle line:90%
to the Creation.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk
about these cycles?

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Where we are,
where we're headed?

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is a fundamental
thing to understand.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.690 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan calendar,
it's this wave movement

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:84%
over seven days and six
nights, so to speak,

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.945 align:middle line:90%
that led up to the shift.

00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's known from
other traditions as well.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.340 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously known
from the Bible.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The book of Genesis, and
the book of Revelations

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.390 align:middle line:84%
both have those sort of
pulses of days, you might say.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the Yuga cycles.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And the Yuga
cycles, I'm not sure if it--

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean
it seems like it's a fall

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.251 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness, rise in
consciousness, day and night,

00:40:34.251 --> 00:40:34.750 align:middle line:90%
similar--

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:35.874 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, could be.

00:40:35.874 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -but over very
long periods of time.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And all of these nine
waves are developing

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.400 align:middle line:84%
through these kind
of wave movement.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And essentially they
are, as you said,

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:56.520 align:middle line:84%
activation, deactivation,
activation, rest,

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
quality differences

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:05.550 align:middle line:84%
between these different
days and the nights.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
There are some that have
been kind of destructive,

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.854 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:41:08.854 --> 00:41:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And then
there are others

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that are sort of more breaking
through into something

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.710 align:middle line:90%
fundamentally new.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that to talk about how
this is going into the future

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.684 align:middle line:90%
would be too technical for us.

00:41:25.684 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: It will be the
topic of my third volume

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:90%
in this trilogy.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.755 align:middle line:10%
>>CALLEMAN: And it's--
those interested,

00:41:33.755 --> 00:41:36.780 align:middle line:10%
there is an article
on my website,

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:42.540 align:middle line:10%
"When Will the Shift in the
Mayan Calendar Manifest"

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.610 align:middle line:10%
where I go into that.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think, it
is-- unfortunately,

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.890 align:middle line:90%
it's not completely simple.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not just now
it's getting better

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.520 align:middle line:90%
or now it's getting worse.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we have these
waves all going concurrently?

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.103 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Exactly.

00:41:57.103 --> 00:42:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you say the
prophecy of October 28, 2011

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.507 align:middle line:90%
hasn't played out yet?

00:42:04.507 --> 00:42:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: No.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:06.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking now it
really will start fairly soon,

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.780 align:middle line:84%
this year I would
say, in a more--

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I would say these
years between 2011

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and the current time have been
fairly uneventful overall.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.680 align:middle line:84%
After this year of
the protester in 2011,

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:90%
it's being fairly uneventful.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And now I think it
is-- that is changing.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:42.870 align:middle line:84%
It's been a clench of
different opposing energies

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that now will be
released, and so things

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:90%
are going to manifest.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
see a continued move,

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
whether it's economically
or otherwise,

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:90%
toward the east from the west?

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
maybe some characteristics

00:42:58.405 --> 00:43:01.020 align:middle line:84%
you might see in-- we might
see in the future with that.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, certainly we see
it in the world's economy

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and we're also
seeing Russia that I

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:84%
think is rising in
power, and-- which

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:84%
is part of this
whole shift again

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:90%
to the eastern hemisphere.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:30.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's not-- the
energies are not there

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:38.530 align:middle line:84%
to make the eastern hemisphere
the dominant, I wouldn't say.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that the previous
dominance of the west

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.240 align:middle line:90%
will now come to an end.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Because, after all,
for 400 years or so

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:49.350 align:middle line:84%
it has been this
western hemisphere

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.232 align:middle line:90%
that has dominated the world.

00:43:51.232 --> 00:43:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you see this
as more of a balance.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.470 align:middle line:84%
We have more an even
distribution of resources,

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:84%
of power, and so
forth, globally then?

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But most important is
the possibility, I think,

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.320 align:middle line:90%
is this ninth wave.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- people have
to seek that contact.

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.590 align:middle line:90%
It won't just come, I think.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And I hope people will
seek it and find it.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is the true hope down
the line for our civilization.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, the
opportunity is here

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.530 align:middle line:84%
not only for own connectedness
to the divine mind

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:37.582 align:middle line:84%
and to the divine, but also to
actually create global unity?

00:44:37.582 --> 00:44:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:39.914 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
possibility is here now?

00:44:39.914 --> 00:44:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: It's here now.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final
thoughts before we go,

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.840 align:middle line:84%
because we'll check in with
you when book three comes out

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.585 align:middle line:84%
and see where it's
headed from here.

00:44:47.585 --> 00:44:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: No.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:50.030 align:middle line:90%
I-- thank you.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:52.981 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to be
here and talk to you.

00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I should say the second
book, it's not out yet.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.120 align:middle line:84%
But it will be about what
happens when people somehow

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.330 align:middle line:84%
are able individually
to deactivate the mind,

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.640 align:middle line:90%
to decouple the mind.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is the whole
story of altered states

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.872 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, like
psychedelics, like--

00:45:15.872 --> 00:45:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just going
to say, entheogens and all

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that, that's really
where that comes in?

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, that's
where it comes in.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
going to be exploring

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:22.970 align:middle line:90%
that in book number two?

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And why?

00:45:24.715 --> 00:45:25.804 align:middle line:90%
Why are you studying that?

00:45:25.804 --> 00:45:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Why are you exploring
that in number two

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:31.010 align:middle line:90%
and decoupling from the grid?

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:32.700 align:middle line:10%
>>CALLEMAN: Oh, I
just see the possibl--

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.969 align:middle line:10%
this gives the framework
to actually understand it.

00:45:35.969 --> 00:45:36.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:40.079 align:middle line:10%
>>CALLEMAN: That's-- and
then I feel I should do it.

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, all right.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Let me know when
number two's out,

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.845 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll go from there.

00:45:45.845 --> 00:45:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Thank you.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Carl.

00:45:47.335 --> 00:45:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Thank you.

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:48.172 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:48.172 --> 00:45:49.630 align:middle line:10%

the book is titled
