00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: This
is a subject I love--

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.950 align:middle line:10%
our connection to
our beloved pets.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.860 align:middle line:10%
Tammy Billups is
a pet medium who

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:10%
has written an award-winning
book on our soul contracts

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:10%
with our pets, and now one on
how our pets can help heal us

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:10%
and we can help heal their
wounded parts as well.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I can't help but think of my
little wounded terrier, Ernie,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
in this subject,
and I'm sure you're

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.732 align:middle line:84%
going to find your little
doggie or cat somewhere

00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:90%
in this story too.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to Tammy.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Tammy, I'm so happy
to have you here.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:90%
I love, love, love this topic.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:10%
>> TAMMY BILLUPS:
Thank you so much.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:10%
I love it too.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.392 align:middle line:10%
I never tire of it.

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's get into
your background and how you

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
ended up doing this
because people,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:84%
how did she end up talking to
animals and connecting with them

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.573 align:middle line:90%
telepathically and so forth?

00:01:00.573 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into
your background a bit.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: OK.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, it wasn't part
of my plan to do this.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%
You've probably
heard that before.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:10%
I began working
with people more.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:10%
I took a four-year
certification to learn

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:10%
how to help people heal
their emotional wounds

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.945 align:middle line:10%
through the energy fields.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was maybe in the
first year of doing that.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And animals had always
been a big blessing to me.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I like many people,
had a lot of trauma

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:84%
in the past where animals
were safer to let in.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I always had
animals close to me.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered, I wonder if
this stuff works with animals.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
interesting because I

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
began asking my friends,
can I work on your animals

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and just see if I can see
what's happening in their energy

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:90%
fields?

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that,
the fascinating thing

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
was that I would look
into their energy field

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.347 align:middle line:90%
and see a clear pattern.

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
characteristics or the way

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that the energy flows for
certain emotional wounds that

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:90%
are predictable.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I would see,
perhaps, that the animal

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
had an abandonment wound
in their energy field.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
ponder their person.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Their person had the
same emotional wound

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:90%
that was unhealed.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:90%
And I found that fascinating.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Now as you're saying
this, everybody

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
think about your pets and
their wounds they bring

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.445 align:middle line:84%
and how you mirror them because
I'm doing that as we're talking.

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:84%
But I have a couple
of questions.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So you must have been very open
and empathetic to begin with.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So you're an empath.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you looked in their
field at their wounds,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
did it show up
similarly too how that

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:90%
would show up in a human field?

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: It did.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if that
was just for ease of me

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:90%
recognizing it.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it'll
present how it needs

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.770 align:middle line:90%
to for your recognition.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.603 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Correct.

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:45.403 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:02:45.403 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:90%
But yes, it was very much there.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And I started noticing that
there were behaviors that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:90%
were the same between them.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
There were certain differences
between how people might show up

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
with abandonment or
an animal, but it

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
is predictable
for different ways

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
that their behaviors
are going to be

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.898 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to
talk a lot or they're

00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:05.532 align:middle line:84%
going to what, depending on
what their emotional wound is.

00:03:05.532 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
As I'm kind of searching
through two in my own mind,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, wow, I
must be schizophrenic

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
because of the variety
of dogs [LAUGHS]

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:90%
that I've brought to me.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting that
the female dogs I've had,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:90%
I got from puppyhood.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:90%
And they were perfect.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
They were just kind of
perfect little dogs.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have any issues.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Confident.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
You could even do
fireworks on 4th of July.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Didn't bother them any.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:84%
The males were the wounded ones
that had, had trauma when I got

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what a difference
in the two types of dogs.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But it was nice to be surrounded
by both kinds of energy,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:84%
but your heart just pours out to
the ones who have been wounded.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Of
course, of course.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.452 align:middle line:84%
So it must have been where you
were on your emotional journey

00:03:49.452 --> 00:03:52.550 align:middle line:84%
as well, that you were open to
receiving that in a new way,

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.653 align:middle line:84%
maybe doing some deeper
work at that time.

00:03:54.653 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and I bring it
up because everybody's

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:84%
thinking they might even
be pausing for a second.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what about that
dog I had back then?

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:90%
And now in your case, it's cat.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the notion,
was there one particular pet

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that you had along the way that
just you knew when you met them,

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
this being was here for you
and you were here for them.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:84%
You knew you had a soul
connection, even before you

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.172 align:middle line:90%
understood all of this.

00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Oh, yeah, it
definitely happened before.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what really changed
my life, because we weren't

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
really allowed
to-- as a child, I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.115 align:middle line:90%
wasn't allowed to have animals.

00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one of those
animal people that says,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I lived on a farm and I was
talking to animals early.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.855 align:middle line:90%
That was not the case.

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
They weren't
allowed in my house.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
They were dirty and
in my mom's mind.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So when I got into my career
that I traveled a bunch

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:84%
in my 20s, I started
wanting an animal,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and a cat seemed to be the
perfect choice for traveling.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
not as codependent.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.343 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Correct.

00:04:50.343 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And so when I got this
kitten, Kahlua, who I

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:90%
found on the side of the road.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:90%
She was a splotchy little--

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.143 align:middle line:84%
I named her Kahlua, because
it looked like someone

00:04:58.143 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:90%
had spilt some on her.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me in a
way that no one had ever

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
looked at me before and it
still brings up emotion today.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.495 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I understand.

00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: And you don't
realize that you've never heard

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.530 align:middle line:84%
or felt unconditional love until
you feel it for the first time.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And animals are so extraordinary
in that they bring that

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
to humans that have had a
lot of trauma in their past.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:90%
She changed me.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
She rocked me at my core
because I had felt that.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that I
could love in that way.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:90%
They were my safety net.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:90%
And they always will be.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
relationship now, of course,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
that I'm on a conscious journey
than the relationship I have

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
with my animals
in my 20s and 30s,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
which were much
more codependent.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:84%
What it really does is
that in the human world,

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.270 align:middle line:90%
love tends to be so conditional.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't be, but
in the end, it is.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
way you understand

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that is by feeling the contrast
when it's not conditional.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The very ones that love us
unconditionally are the ones

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:90%
that we outlive too.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.112 align:middle line:84%
And that, certainly for a lot of
people, is the biggest trauma--

00:06:12.112 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest
traumas in their life.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, and I had a dog named
Sugar Bear who was a Samoyed.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.097 align:middle line:90%
She was draped over a man's arm.

00:06:20.097 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
He was walking through
the parking lot

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and he was carrying a
little free sign with him.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this can't be this
cute little floppy white puppy.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And she ended up being the
most unconditionally loving,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:84%
beautiful entity that I
had ever met in my life,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
just like what
you're talking about.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And actually, because my
love for her was so deep,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I stayed in a not very good
human relationship for years.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Oh, for the kids.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, for the kids.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think people can really
understand that and relate

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to now
how the soul contract

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
part of it, because that's
another book you've written

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
before we start going
into the reflective

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:90%
mirrored healing parts.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.165 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: So that
we do have these,

00:07:02.165 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:84%
our souls line up agreements
between us and our animals.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:90%
These things are preconceived.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we'll reincarnate.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.950 align:middle line:84%
The same animals were
incarnate with us several times

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.900 align:middle line:84%
because we're so familiar
with them, which is amazing.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:84%
We'll recognize them
just like with people.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we will embark
upon these agreements

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:84%
that we have with animals to
help us grow, learn, heal,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:84%
evolve, depending on
what we're needing

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:90%
on our evolutionary journey.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And animals will help us
direct ourselves in the journey

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:90%
that we want to evolve to.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They're evolving
as well, of course,

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.967 align:middle line:84%
but we really line up
these things in advance.

00:07:40.967 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Give me some examples
of what you've seen with some

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.990 align:middle line:84%
of your clients in
terms of soul contracts?

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I love these stories,
because we always

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:90%
think that we're in control.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And, well, I think
it's time to get a cat

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and that's the end of the story.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to go
somewhere and find a cute cat.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.085 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
what's really going on.

00:08:00.085 --> 00:08:00.885 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Right.

00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:02.635 align:middle line:84%
People think they're
just getting this pet

00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and they're just going to
have this unconditional love

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to be able
to go on walks with them

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and, oh, they're
helping them exercise.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot more
going on under the surface

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and at a soul level
for your growth.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And the more open
you are to that,

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
then the more soul
contracts are going

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:90%
to start revealing themselves.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
The higher purpose
of your arrangement

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
as to why you came together
to learn and grow together.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It's truly extraordinary
what animals

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:90%
are willing to do with us.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So tell us a
couple of examples of people

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and their pets you've read
what they thought was happening

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
versus what was
actually happening.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Well, I'll start
with something more simplistic.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Early when I started
working with animals a bit,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and like so much
of the time, people

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:84%
will call and want
to fix their animal.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
My animal is doing this, will
you help them stop doing this?

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Tell them I don't want
them to jump on the sofa.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Can you fix them?

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one
call in particular

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.927 align:middle line:84%
of a woman who just called
and she said, I have this dog

00:09:02.927 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and he's jumping and he's
jumping and he's jumping

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and he's jumping and I can't
get him to stop jumping.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And I just don't know
what to do and she's

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:90%
going on and on and on.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And her voice is jumping
and jumping and jumping.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And I started working with the
dog and the dog immediately

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
calmed and got
grounded and was fine.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.150 align:middle line:90%
But her energy didn't change.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:84%
She stayed in this
very ungrounded state

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:84%
where she was very
jumpy herself.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And so then she called a
week later and she goes,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:90%
well, it didn't stick.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how can
we look at this differently?

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:90%
How about, do you meditate?

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm open to meditate.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, can you meditate
together maybe?

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you go walking,
can you more intentionally

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:84%
see yourself grounding
because your dog is picking up

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:90%
on everything that you're doing.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And that little leash is a
little energetic umbilical

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:90%
cord between the two of you.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:90%
So she said, I'll try.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:90%
And she began trying that.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't hear
from her for a long time.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.933 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's good
news and sometimes not.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
But six months later, I started
getting a lot of referrals

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:90%
from her.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And she said that
was the ticket.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized that
when the person is on board,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that's when the animal
change and that's when

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:90%
it's more sustainable.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
That's when it's
going to stick what

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:90%
you're wanting for your animal.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Same with the ailments.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And so much of the
time, Regina, I

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.270 align:middle line:84%
see people become aware of
a conscious journey because

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
of something that they're
doing for their animal.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:90%
They may not be aware yet.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:84%
They may not be on
a conscious journey.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
But then in order
to fix their animal,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:84%
they tried an
animal communicator.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:90%
They tried herbs.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
They tried things that started
to open their minds to something

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, the
animal said, yeah, high five.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
She's doing it now
or he's doing it now.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And they started learning
about consciousness

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and what they could
do for themselves.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But when they begin a
conscious journey together,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:90%
that's when it gets juicy.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love
doing what I do.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I can imagine
what gratifying work.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk
about maybe a story

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
of abandonment, because
I look at people

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:16.175 align:middle line:84%
are picking their dogs up at
the pound or at SPCA oftentimes.

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So you know that there
might be issues there.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Yeah, so abandonment
is one of those issues where,

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:84%
of course, it's easy to
recognize within the animal

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of times, they've
been adopted and returned,

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:90%
adopted and returned.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have
separation anxiety.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're overeating.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
They use oral fixations,
carry around a toy,

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:84%
over lick, all kinds of things
that are really predictable.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the person's
not quite as aware

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:84%
of their heavy abandonment
wounds until they get together.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And regardless of whether or
not the animal has abandonment

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
before you adopt them, if
you're the one they land with,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I promise you you've got
abandonment wounding.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I remember there was a gentleman
named Rick that called me

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.330 align:middle line:84%
about Sammy, and his
primary motive in calling

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.110 align:middle line:90%
was you need to fix Sammy.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.190 align:middle line:90%
He's way too needy.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:90%
I can't leave the farm.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:90%
He's running after the truck.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't go anywhere.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Can you fix Sammy?

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, so let's focus
on Sammy's abandonment wound.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But I just want you to be
open to doing this with him.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Are you open to
a tandem session?

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm open to it.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
He was very open and
conscious about it.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So he would lay down while
I do the session as well.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And they both began working
on their abandonment wound.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:84%
After the second
session, he said, well,

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Sammy's not chasing
the truck anymore.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
He goes, but you
know what I realized?

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, every single
love relationship I've had,

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:84%
these girlfriends get very
needy and very attached

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and in the same way that
Sammy gets attached.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
isn't that interesting?

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I think
I've got abandonment.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I think
you're onto something.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.458 align:middle line:84%
And then he said I want
to just work on me.

00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, that's
the way that it works.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
this is so wonderful

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.500 align:middle line:84%
because you're
qualified to do both.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.560 align:middle line:90%
So they go in tandem.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes
these animals come

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.310 align:middle line:84%
into our life to show
us this about ourselves.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And you just said
something, when abandonment

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
over-licking, for example,

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and overeating because I'm
just thinking of a situation,

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to
sprinkle-- this show,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to totally take
advantage of the time to bring

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:90%
in my own anecdotes here.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Bring it on.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:90%
So little Ernie.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
He had great emotional
difficulties.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:84%
He was about nine
months old, running

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
in a very busy
intersection in Phoenix.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Someone found him.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And my friend who does animal
rescue ended up with him.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And he wouldn't
let her touch him.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
He was freaked out
just with his ears down

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and eyes wide, hugging
the side of the sofa.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh goodness, I
just felt so sorry for him.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I met him and we
bonded instantly,

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
but he never bonded
with anyone else.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I was his bond, but I already
had a little dog named

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Angel, little Bichon, who I
was driving through Malibu

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and just happened to stop at a
cafe with a pet shop next door.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And she had a perfect life.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:84%
She was like 16 weeks
old, cute and happy

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:90%
and fluffy, jumped in my lap.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, she was about, I'd say,
five years old when I got Ernie.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't occur to
me till you said that.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
That's when she started
excessively licking her paws.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So in that case, because
Ernie was so needy,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.355 align:middle line:84%
she must have felt abandoned
because I think she did.

00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
She started getting her
feelings hurt easily.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Well, sometimes
licking can also be

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:84%
a self-soothing or helping
others move out energy

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:90%
in the house.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.156 align:middle line:90%
So if she was--

00:14:43.156 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: She
was the first dog,

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
the one that had
no issues really.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.407 align:middle line:90%
She was just happy as can be.

00:14:48.407 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: She sounds like
she's more of the older soul

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:90%
of the two.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
they will help

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:84%
to soothe in some way
the other animals.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So she has to soothe
herself by licking her paws.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: It might be a
way that she's moving out

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.040 align:middle line:90%
the energy.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it could be
a little bit of that--

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.850 align:middle line:90%
without intimately--

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Feeling abandoned.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: It could be that
as well that there's some type

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:90%
of interaction with that.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But it sounds like
she was probably--

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that she could
sense his anxiety.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And so she's helping
him move it out.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.910 align:middle line:90%
A lot of anxiety.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:90%
She was very sensitive.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.647 align:middle line:90%
And helping move out the energy.

00:15:28.647 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he
was super intuitive.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:90%
You thought it.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:90%
He already knew.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.422 align:middle line:84%
You had to really be careful
what you thought of around him

00:15:35.422 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
if you thought, OK, we're
going to have a bath today,

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:84%
he'd already be hiding
if I thought it.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
They get the
visuals in our mind.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah,
they're picking all that up.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: They do.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, my God,
it's so fascinating.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So now this gets to
another question then.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So you might have
a cat in the house

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe you decide to
get a little puppy as well.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Are there soul contracts
between the other animals too?

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Yeah, definitely,
they know each other sometimes

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
together before.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they have some karma
to work out amongst each other.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I write about that
in Animal Soul Contracts

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.752 align:middle line:90%
where they do come in knowing.

00:16:09.752 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
There are people who will
call and they'll say,

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.335 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about
getting this animal.

00:16:13.335 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Do they have any stuff together?

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.283 align:middle line:84%
Does my animal-- my dog now
have any stuff with that?

00:16:18.283 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'll see a little
angst between their higher

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.325 align:middle line:84%
selves where it's
going to be difficult

00:16:22.325 --> 00:16:25.325 align:middle line:84%
for them to be together, because
last time, it wasn't so great.

00:16:25.325 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And maybe something
really bad happened

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:84%
at the end from one of
them towards the other.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll remember that
just like we do at a soul level,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes
they'll work it out.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Just like us, they come
together to heal together.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:90%
They're looking to evolve.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
They're looking to resolve
their past wounding

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:90%
this life or past life.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Angel's case,
Angel lived to be 15.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Ernie died young.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:90%
He had so many emotional wounds.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:90%
And I think I get it why.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:84%
But she died the same day as
my father, both unexpectedly.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
It happened very quickly
with both of them

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:90%
and I always wondered.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it was almost
like a gift of freedom,

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
like she left at the same
time because life was

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.262 align:middle line:90%
going to change or something.

00:17:13.262 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Did they
have a relationship?

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They didn't.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I took her to see--
she was in the car

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:84%
when I went to see my dad, and
things weren't right that day.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:84%
His mind was all over and I
didn't know what was going on.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So I just said goodbye to
him and told him no worries.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And she had a seizure
right after that in the car

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, oh my
God, what's going on?

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:90%
And they both died the next day.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Wow.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Just like that.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: That would have
to be something with you

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:90%
and the changes--

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It had to do.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm bringing
every example up

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:84%
because so many
people watching have

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.220 align:middle line:84%
been through so
many of these things

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.387 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just trying to put--

00:17:53.387 --> 00:17:55.845 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: I lost all three
of my animals at the same time

00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:90%
right after my mother.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Big life changes.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Same with my father.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I lost my two
animals afterwards.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they're in
relationship with that,

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:90%
where they're ready to maybe--

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:90%
I thought--

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: We're ready.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We are and they are
ready to free us because we

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.210 align:middle line:84%
might need the
freedom on some level.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: We've learned.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten what they came
into our life to learn.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Soul contracts are complete.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:10%
We're shifting into a new
level, a higher octave,

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is, it's complete.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:10%
And we're in the--

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:10%
I see that often where
there are multiple passings

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.953 align:middle line:10%
and it's difficult to
go through those times.

00:18:29.953 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.453 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: So difficult when
there are multiple passings like

00:18:33.453 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
that, but they are the
most transformational.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.907 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
were your animals--

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:39.032 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't like there was
one that was sick and gave

00:18:39.032 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:90%
the disease.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:90%
They were individually--

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Yeah, right after
my big awakening came through

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.502 align:middle line:90%
the death of my mother.

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And then that kitty Kahlua-- my
first kitty was my big awakening

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:84%
in that two weeks after my
mother passed, I'd had--

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.310 align:middle line:84%
my mom was talking about
people on the other side coming

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:90%
to greet her.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.745 align:middle line:84%
She was having
those conversations.

00:19:00.745 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:90%
That was all new to me.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.710 align:middle line:84%
It sent me on this whole journey
of there's this other world

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And then Kahlua, all of a
sudden, when she passed,

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:90%
my mother hated cats.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, who's
going to greet her?

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And I asked spirit to
bring Kahlua back to me.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.190 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden that evening, I
turn off the light, turn over,

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
she's always jump on
my head, come around.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And I felt something
jump up on the bed,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.175 align:middle line:84%
walk around and wait
for me to lift her up.

00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:30.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, my God.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I turn on the light,
there's no Kahlua.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:90%
That started my journey.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.200 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I could
see into other dimensions--

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.920 align:middle line:90%
I could see her.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
She's back with
me now as roomy--

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:90%
as kitty roomy.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So different now,
but same kitty.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, these animals
have been springboards.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So you had multiple contracts
with her in this lifetime.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And then she passed
right afterwards.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Right.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:90%
After mom did.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And the other two
passed right away

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:90%
at 11, 8, and 6 years of age.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
They brought me into
this new journey.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
It was so difficult, but they
did what they had come to do.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's so beautiful.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I think Sugar Bear, the one I
talked about, she came back very

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
quickly as another Alaskan breed
and my ex-- he was my ex by now

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and we had a son.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, this dog sure
does feel like Sugar Bear.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:90%
She does the same thing, rescue.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
When she's lying down,
it's in the same position.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:90%
So I went and said, Sugar Bear.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And she was like this and
answered and turned around

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:90%
and ran toward me.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And she stayed with them because
she was to be there for my son,

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:84%
because he was back and forth
with the custody arrangement.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And she was there to stabilize
him at his dad's house.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:90%
It was so beautiful.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, he'll get
teared up if he hears about me.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: I love that.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
Mary Bucholtz.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:90%
I love this story.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Caring for Creatures--
Animal Sanctuary.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's talk about her
story with her rescue cats.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty phenomenal.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Oh, with
the ones where--

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, because I have her in
there a couple of times.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, the UTI.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.007 align:middle line:84%
So Mary, when she first started
her rescue organization,

00:21:16.007 --> 00:21:18.340 align:middle line:84%
some of the animals would be
in her house at that point.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
So her house was on
the sanctuary grounds.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
But before they
were building all

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.840 align:middle line:84%
of the buildings for all the
rescues, a lot of the animals

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:90%
were in the house.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
morning long ago when

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Mary got up in the morning
and she felt awful.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.958 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really sick.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I went
to the restroom.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had a really
bad UTI and the kitties

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:84%
were all-- all the
rescued kitties were

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:90%
meowing for their breakfast.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:90%
And she went to--

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:90%
she said, it's just got to wait.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:90%
She was that ill.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And she laid back down on
the bed and she fell asleep.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And when she woke up,
she looked and there were

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
six cats on the bed
with their bottoms

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:84%
up against three
on each side just--

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right against on
her lower part of her body.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Right against her.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.962 align:middle line:90%
And she said, what?

00:22:03.962 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Because these were
cats that didn't

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:84%
commingle together and certainly
didn't come up on the bed

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as she sat up,
she realized she had no pain.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
All the symptoms
were completely gone.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:90%
And we know this about animals.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:84%
We know they're
extraordinary healers.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.860 align:middle line:84%
We hear about these
things all the time,

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
but I really want people
to realize how much they're

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
doing this for us, and to
maybe slip into a Lao mode,

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to allow it and find
gratitude for it.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, my God, yes.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.277 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:34.277 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to flip
things a little bit.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:90%
So if you are--

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:84%
say if you have
issues of abandonment

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and then you bring in
a little animal that

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
has issues of abandonment, some
people might flip it and ask,

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:84%
well, if I bring in an animal
that has the same issues I have,

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
isn't that essentially
instantiating the same issues

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.290 align:middle line:90%
in music going deeper?

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Well, sure, that's
what you want at a soul level.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:90%
That's what we want.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it could get
better before it gets worse.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Yes, or get
worse before it gets better.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.998 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:23:04.998 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:90%
We're magnets for that.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
At a soul level, we're
calling in beings

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:84%
that are going to help us
get to the root of what

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:90%
we're wanting to heal.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So of course, we're going to
call in animals that sometimes

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:84%
are the agitators,
and we're going

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:84%
to call in the ones that
are looking at us like we're

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:84%
golden because we're trying to
believe that about ourselves.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we're going
to call that in.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Yes, when two
people come in they

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:84%
have abandonment wounds, when
you're on a conscious journey,

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:84%
you can say, let's
heal this together.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit different then.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.555 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:23:35.555 --> 00:23:36.355 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:36.355 --> 00:23:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So now we're talking about
the emotional wounds here.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
you write about in the book

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.160 align:middle line:84%
is that the same
beliefs we have,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
the most common simple
beliefs that we carry often

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
throughout incarnations are the
same beliefs the animals carry,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
which is statements such
as I'm bad, I'm not enough,

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and I'm unlovable.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So when they come to
us, they may very well

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.998 align:middle line:84%
be carrying these
exact same beliefs,

00:24:03.998 --> 00:24:06.540 align:middle line:84%
except beliefs I think, work
differently in the animal world.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.133 align:middle line:90%
They embody it more.

00:24:08.133 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: It's a bit more.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Plus they're amplified
usually within them for us

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.710 align:middle line:84%
until we get it and we
start consciously working

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:90%
on our wound.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And then they can usually
heal much faster, much faster,

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
depending on, of course, every
soul is wired a bit differently.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But they will-- yes, I call them
emotional wound soul contracts.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And for those of us
that get emotionally

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.980 align:middle line:84%
close to our animals, which
are millions of people who

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
turn to animals because they are
safer, well, at a soul level,

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:90%
we're always seeking growth.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:90%
It's medicine for the soul.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So yes, domesticated animals
are on the front line

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:84%
of the animal kingdom's mission
to help humanity to embrace

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.870 align:middle line:90%
consciousness in a new level.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.662 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, domestic
pets, absolutely.

00:24:52.662 --> 00:24:53.462 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes.

00:24:53.462 --> 00:24:55.687 align:middle line:84%
In a way that we wouldn't
have-- millions of people

00:24:55.687 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
would not have ways to
continue their growth

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.410 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't for the
safety of animals

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:90%
to be able to help us do this.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And healing our emotional wounds
is a big part of why we're here.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:84%
When we do that, we
are moving forward.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:90%
We are raising consciousness.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So yes, these animals
are going to come in.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.273 align:middle line:84%
If you've been betrayed, they're
probably going to have betrayal.

00:25:15.273 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Usually how people describe
their animals as they're

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:90%
describing a bit of themselves.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:84%
My animals are very
stubborn, and he

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:84%
wants to do what he wants
to do and he wants to do it.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, great,
that might mirror you.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, I kind
of am that way.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So they're probably
here together

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:34.230 align:middle line:84%
to heal that particular wound
and soften the effects of it.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So you have a little
bit of typology in here,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:84%
which people enjoy, which is the
five types of emotional wounds

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:84%
in your pets--
your cats and dogs,

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and you might even say parrots
and birds as well, I don't know.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And I will bring Ernie
into the conversation

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:84%
again because the first
one is the scared one--

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:54.900 align:middle line:90%
terror.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yeah.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:84%
The scared ones are
those people and animals

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
who have certainly experienced
a lot of terror in past lives

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and in this life-- torture
really, and usually begins

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:84%
with two-leggeds anyway,
as early as the birth canal

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and being in the
womb of maybe they

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:84%
were a birth that wasn't wanted,
maybe even tried to abort.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.623 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, they don't
bring all of their soul energy

00:26:21.623 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:84%
in because they say, oh no,
no, I remember this now.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.123 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I want to do this.

00:26:25.123 --> 00:26:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to try to
go back to the other side.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And that can happen with animals
as well at the hands of people,

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:90%
especially.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:90%
They have experienced a lot.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the scared ones come in
wanting to feel safe in a body

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:84%
again, wanting to
heal the terror.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And those are when we
know where they are.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of your
animals you mentioned--

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ernest.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yeah.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.010 align:middle line:84%
he probably had a lot of
terror in his background

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.257 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to
overcome by being here.

00:26:54.257 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they will
set up circumstances

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.990 align:middle line:90%
for that to do it together.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Interesting
because, like I said,

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:84%
he bonded with me and I
could do anything with him.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I could bathe him,
whatever needed to be done.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.640 align:middle line:90%
As long as it was me.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But he wouldn't let
anyone else close to him.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yeah.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And that can be because
they feel unsafe.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And so clearly, you established
this great bond with him.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.957 align:middle line:84%
You had a contract
to help him to heal.

00:27:22.957 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was instant.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
He literally let me touch him.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yeah.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.190 align:middle line:90%
In a way that nobody else could.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, that's
going to be helping him.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.428 align:middle line:90%
And it's helping you.

00:27:33.428 --> 00:27:35.470 align:middle line:84%
You might have been clearing
some karma with him.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.030 align:middle line:90%
You might have--

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
the birth canal.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.410 align:middle line:84%
The whole birth
thing, I did not.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I definitely came
kicking and screaming

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and came frank breech,
very long labor.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.770 align:middle line:90%
But first, didn't want to.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:84%
At the last minute, no, no, no,
I don't want to do this one.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:90%
So there was that.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.513 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: And we're all going
to relate a little bit to each

00:27:54.513 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:90%
of the patterns.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But some are going
to be two to three

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:84%
that we're really going
to feel as real for us.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.315 align:middle line:84%
And those are the animals that
are going to mirror that for us.

00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
the scared one.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Then there's the needy one.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're
talking abandonment.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Abandonment, yes.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And this usually starts in
the oral developmental phase

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:84%
about that time when
the mother is trying to,

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to suckle on the
mother's teat for the animals.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
you don't get enough

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:84%
or you don't have that
spiritual connection.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.487 align:middle line:84%
And of course, with big litters,
with animals, as it happens,

00:28:26.487 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the mother
passes, sometimes

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:90%
the mother rejects them.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
all kinds of things

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:31.920 align:middle line:90%
that can happen with animals.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
With people, we know
those things as well.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the mother
isn't able to nurse.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's
some type of the baby

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:42.060 align:middle line:84%
isn't able to digest the
milk for whatever reason.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:90%
And they don't get enough.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes the mother is working.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:90%
None of it's wrong.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we all came into
to heal these things together.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's past life of famine,
starvation, all kinds of things

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.230 align:middle line:84%
that you come forth with if you
have any type of abandonment

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.290 align:middle line:90%
wounds to heal.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, you're going to be
coming together to heal that.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to,
as always, you're

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:84%
going to adapt coping
mechanisms that

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:84%
help you do that
with oral fixations,

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.548 align:middle line:84%
with the oral developmental
phase abandonment.

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:12.590 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be looking
external to get filled

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know how
to fill yourself because you

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.410 align:middle line:84%
weren't filled fully at a time
when you needed to know that,

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm sustained here.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I can actually
withdraw from the teat,

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:90%
and I know that I have enough.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when you don't get that
feeling, everything is external.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.953 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeking to be
filled externally.

00:29:30.953 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to have
enough time, enough money,

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:90%
enough food, enough whatever.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough syndrome.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Same for the animal.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Not enough food.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
know it until you

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.190 align:middle line:84%
start to satiate within and
begin to really look at,

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:90%
how do I fill this up?

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.340 align:middle line:84%
How do I satiate myself
in ways that I want.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And usually, of course,
that starts with love.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And releasing the emotions.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:84%
That is kind of mad about
that I didn't get that right

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.490 align:middle line:84%
or whatever emotions
there are that need

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:84%
to come up to clear so that we
can begin implementing the newer

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.690 align:middle line:84%
ways and putting the reparenting
in place that's needed.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.407 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK,
the sensitive one.

00:30:04.407 --> 00:30:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Sensitive one.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.333 align:middle line:84%
These first three
that I mentioned,

00:30:07.333 --> 00:30:08.750 align:middle line:84%
these are the ones
that are really

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
attracted to animals for
filling that feels safer

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:90%
to be around animals more so.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.420 align:middle line:84%
The next two, next two,
of course, as well.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But these three really turn to
animals because they're safer.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Invasiveness is what's
behind the sensitive ones.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So these are people that were
criticized, had a lot of trauma

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.220 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Different.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:27.930 align:middle line:90%
With the scared ones.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It's more of physical trauma.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.700 align:middle line:84%
If there's sexual abuse,
it's very traumatic.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:84%
With the sensitive
ones, it's covert.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It was the father
who touched you.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't say anything.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:84%
It was manipulative
or it was just an

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:84%
over controlling parent,
or maybe even teasing

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:84%
from a parent or a brother or a
sibling in some way, a cousin,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.590 align:middle line:90%
some type of abuse.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And then with animals,
a lot of times

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.810 align:middle line:84%
they're over-controlled
by the people

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that they first get there where
they're so over controlled

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.000 align:middle line:90%
and it feels invasive.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or in a
chain, stop that.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Right.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Or in a very small space,
maybe they're kept in a crate.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But they're
over-controlled a lot

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to be
magnets to each other.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:90%
These are people who are very--

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and animals, very empathetic
because they have no boundaries,

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.820 align:middle line:84%
because they were
over-controlled,

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.380 align:middle line:84%
people came into
their boundaries.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So they're feeling everything
and they're very sensitive,

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:27.610 align:middle line:84%
become fabulous healers, I might
add, because they are intuitive.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.625 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
animals that a lot

00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:31.250 align:middle line:84%
of times they want
to be under the bed,

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:90%
not like the scared ones.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.580 align:middle line:84%
They want to be in
a really safe place,

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:84%
but the sensitive
ones are just--

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.550 align:middle line:84%
let me observe this
from afar, because I

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.380 align:middle line:84%
know everything about everybody
who's walking in this house.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.047 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to let
you know who's good

00:31:44.047 --> 00:31:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and who's not, because
they can read their energy.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.920 align:middle line:90%
And the same with people.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.605 align:middle line:84%
These are people who go
into social situations.

00:31:51.605 --> 00:31:52.730 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling everything.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:84%
They can get very
overwhelmed by that.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And these sensitive
animals are teaching

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.360 align:middle line:84%
them to take time for
themselves, that it's

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.380 align:middle line:90%
OK to be wired differently.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.260 align:middle line:84%
That they can-- I don't have
to be social all the time.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.780 align:middle line:90%
I need to replenish my energy.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I need to go take some
meditation time to refuel.

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is, I think,
very helpful for people.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.705 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the protector.

00:32:16.705 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes, protector.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.370 align:middle line:90%
The fire energy of all.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:21.700 align:middle line:90%
The fire energy.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And we know and hear
these animals and people

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.540 align:middle line:90%
way in advance.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:84%
They're righting the
wrongs of the world.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
tell you who's wrong.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, my God,
I have one of those.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Oh, did you?

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Finbar, the old sailor man.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.420 align:middle line:84%
But these are the fire
energy people on animals.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.590 align:middle line:90%
And they're the doers.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.220 align:middle line:84%
They're the masculine energy
out of any of the patterns.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And so these are the ones that,
of course, are more reactive.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:84%
These are the biters with
a lot of the animals--

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.160 align:middle line:90%
and the people, not literally.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But they are the ones
that are the protectors

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and the invasiveness wounds
that are coming together

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
as pairs because they're
going after the invasiveness

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and the invasiveness are trying
to learn their boundaries so

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that they say enough to the
ones that are the protectors.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
protective animals

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.450 align:middle line:84%
are in the life of
an invasive person

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.030 align:middle line:84%
to provide protection
for that part was never

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:84%
protected within you, because
a lot of times, I'll say, well,

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.570 align:middle line:84%
does the animal react just
when they're with you?

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, no one else but me.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't do it
with anyone else.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're protecting a part
of you that was never protected.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.733 align:middle line:90%
There's the growth.

00:33:27.733 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Finbar, oh, my gosh.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:90%
A friend of mine had him.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.017 align:middle line:84%
She was a prominent in the
town, had a little magazine,

00:33:34.017 --> 00:33:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and people had to
go over to her place

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.860 align:middle line:84%
to work out their
editorial stuff,

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and they'd be greeted at
the door with this beast.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.830 align:middle line:84%
He was this large
Australian shepherd mix.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And he would jump up at
the door and everyone

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:84%
was like this, like,
could you please stop him

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:90%
so I can come in?

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And she was very aggressive
and she bit and he bit.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: And was there a
person that was mirroring them

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:90%
that was stronger?

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Just like that.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And so, ultimately, she had to
move and no one would take him--

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:90%
the sucker.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows me.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.454 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, Regina,
he's such a good boy really.

00:34:12.454 --> 00:34:14.290 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, really?

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.949 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, I
go over to the--

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:18.219 align:middle line:90%
I'm so stupid.

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:19.540 align:middle line:90%
I go over to the house.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.719 align:middle line:90%
He comes and sits at my feet.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Rolls his head back on
my knees and stares at me

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.820 align:middle line:90%
with these big puppy eyes.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I was
totally in and conned

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:90%
from the first minute.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And he was a total
gentleman with me.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But what turned out
when the people would

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:84%
come to deliver
something in particular,

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:84%
it appeared he'd rush out the
door before we could catch him.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.480 align:middle line:84%
We thought he was
trying to bite them.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.402 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to hurt
them-- it turned out.

00:34:45.402 --> 00:34:46.860 align:middle line:84%
He was getting
their sleeve, trying

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to get them to come
back to the house.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So very complex
character, anyway.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Well,
with those protectors,

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.600 align:middle line:84%
they're covering up
their heart energy

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.990 align:middle line:90%
because they're protecting it.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: She was
such a big heart.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had so much
wonderful, big hearted energy

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:08.660 align:middle line:84%
from dogs, no matter
how damaged they appear.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And the last one
is the perfect one.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:90%
The perfectionism.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Yes.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:90%
As in perfectionism.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is more that
detachment of the true self.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And with people,
and usually, they're

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.230 align:middle line:84%
brought up in
families where there's

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.350 align:middle line:84%
another perfectionistic
parent in some way, that's

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:84%
teaching them to focus more
on external appearances,

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:84%
on material gains, on how
they can show up in the--

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.790 align:middle line:84%
every profile is about the
learned progress of how

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:39.030 align:middle line:90%
they feel safe in the world.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what's underneath it.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And how the perfect
one feels safe--

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.620 align:middle line:90%
it's by appearing perfect.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And these are the people
that when they're fully

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.180 align:middle line:84%
immersed in it,
of course, we have

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.450 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of each of them.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.300 align:middle line:84%
These are the persons
that always look perfect,

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.433 align:middle line:84%
their lawns look perfect,
their houses are perfect.

00:35:53.433 --> 00:35:54.350 align:middle line:90%
And they over-control.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Controls
are all paid on time.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Refrigerator's
stocked and lined up.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.217 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: They're
at the gym at 6:00 AM.

00:35:59.217 --> 00:36:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they make it all look easy.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And they bring a lot of
envy from others, actually,

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.480 align:middle line:90%
as well from people who maybe--

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like us, whose
lives are a little messier.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Right.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of heart protection
around these animals and people

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:15.030 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:84%
But once these two people--
the people and the animal,

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I should say, come together
and on a conscious journey,

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.430 align:middle line:90%
they're a dynamic duo.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And they are serving
the world in ways

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that no other pairing can,
because they are grounded, they

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:33.080 align:middle line:84%
begin to have more of an
open heart versus always

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:84%
being in the mind, always
trying to figure things out.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:84%
They're beginning
to feel things out

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
as they begin to heal
on a conscious journey.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And these animals are a
little bit more detached.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.680 align:middle line:84%
They're not the warm and
fuzzy abandonment who say,

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll take the attention
from everyone.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.660 align:middle line:84%
These animals are
more holding what

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I call transformational
healing presence,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's where they
can walk in the room

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:90%
and everybody feels better.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Everyone feels better.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:90%
But they aren't looking.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They aren't going
to be on your lap.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.400 align:middle line:84%
They aren't going
to be licking you.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:84%
They're holding-- and horses do
this really well all the time.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.940 align:middle line:84%
They hold this sacred
presence for others.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And the people as
well, when they really

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.160 align:middle line:84%
begin to heal behind
the perfectionism

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.162 align:middle line:84%
and begin to open their heart
more to the experiences,

00:37:15.162 --> 00:37:18.210 align:middle line:84%
then they show up in this
sacred, beautiful work

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.780 align:middle line:84%
that is undeniable
for how many masses

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:84%
they can reach because these
are people and animals who

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.580 align:middle line:90%
don't mind being seen.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.300 align:middle line:90%
They're in the nursing homes.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.270 align:middle line:90%
They're approaching others.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.890 align:middle line:90%
They're guides.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.810 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
minute or two left.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to
ask to, you'd like

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.230 align:middle line:90%
to talk about the albatross.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's just finish on the
story of the albatross.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Oh,
the albatross, yes.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:84%
The albatross, I was
definitely drawn.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.400 align:middle line:84%
As I was writing
the book, I started

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.140 align:middle line:84%
reading more about the
journey of the albatross.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:90%
And they can fly.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.690 align:middle line:90%
I forget how much it is.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it's like
42,000 miles a year.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.923 align:middle line:84%
And they begin in
this one little place,

00:37:58.923 --> 00:37:59.840 align:middle line:90%
wherever they're born.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And they make these
trips around the world.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And I began thinking, oh, my
gosh, what are their journeys?

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:90%
What are their stories?

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.530 align:middle line:90%
What they might have seen.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.612 align:middle line:84%
They can actually sleep
while they're flying.

00:38:11.612 --> 00:38:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.785 align:middle line:90%
What amazing trait.

00:38:13.785 --> 00:38:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: And so what's
the wonderful thing about

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.770 align:middle line:84%
the albatross is
that once they land,

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.700 align:middle line:84%
they don't sit around and say,
I'm not going to do that again.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
take that journey.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.380 align:middle line:84%
That hurricane I had to
go around was too much.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.460 align:middle line:84%
They pack up their
bags and they take off

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.870 align:middle line:84%
on another journey
around the world again.

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't sit and
do what we do and say

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.250 align:middle line:90%
I need to be in this safe place.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.630 align:middle line:84%
They trust that they have
an inner compass within them

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.630 align:middle line:90%
to guide them.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's
what animals teach us,

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that we have the beautiful
inner compass within us

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:84%
to guide all of our journeys
and our partnerships with them.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I love that
and that's beautiful.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Any final little quick
thought before we say goodbye?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BILLUPS: Well, I'd
like to say one thing,

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.710 align:middle line:84%
in that when you have an
animal that's looking at you,

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.560 align:middle line:84%
like you're golden, and
they open your heart

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking at you and
saying you are the best thing

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:12.290 align:middle line:84%
since sliced bread, you
would best honor them.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:84%
If you look in the mirror
and you believe them,

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.770 align:middle line:84%
just believe them because that's
why they came in your life.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.350 align:middle line:10%
They don't want to hold
your golden energy for you.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.710 align:middle line:10%
Believe that you are what
your animal sees in you.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, that's beautiful.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Tammy, thank you so much.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.120 align:middle line:84%
I've enjoyed every
moment of this talk.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BILLUPS: Thank you so much.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:32.720 align:middle line:90%
I have as well.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tammy's new book is
called Your Animal Your Soul

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Mirror.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I love this topic,
as you can tell.

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you've
enjoyed the conversation

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and see yourself in it as
well, and also your pets.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:46.000 align:middle line:10%
