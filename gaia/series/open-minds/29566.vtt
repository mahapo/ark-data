00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: It's been
a great frustration in myself

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and many others that the
history of ancient Egypt appears

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to have been obscured,
misdirecting us to believe that

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:84%
virtual savages built some of
the world's most sophisticated

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:10%
The good news is
that the information

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:10%
is pouring in now
from all quarters

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:10%
as to the real nature of the
Egyptian cultures of the past

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and the vast body of esoteric
understanding they possessed.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:10%
Carmen Boulter is
one of the new wisdom

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:10%
keepers of the
ancient Egyptian ways.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:10%
Her documentary series
"The Pyramid Code"

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.426 align:middle line:10%
puts many of the
myths about ancients

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:10%
to rest while bringing
the fullness of what

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:10%
once was to light.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely beautiful
and welcome.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I really-- I'm so
happy to meet you.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I met you
probably four years ago now

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:84%
when you were starting to
put this documentary series

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.357 align:middle line:90%
together at the CPAC Conference.

00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>> CARMEN BOULTER: That's right.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we talked about
once it's all done you have

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:90%
to come here.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.246 align:middle line:90%
Well, here you are.

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Thanks
for having me.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.411 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what I
wanted to do, Carmen,

00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I just alluded to this, is
let's do some myth-busting.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of the
most commonly perpetuated myths

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that no longer hold in
light of the new sciences

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:90%
about Egyptology.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.977 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to let you
just take it on that.

00:01:27.977 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, most
people learn in school that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids were
built by slaves.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:10%
But of course, we don't have the
technology to take them down,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:10%
so certainly it would
take engineers and really

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:10%
high-level scientists,
so they couldn't possibly

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:10%
have been built by slaves.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:10%
We're told that they were built
for the ego of pharaohs, which

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:10%
also isn't the way the
matriarchal culture worked.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:10%
And we're told that
they were tombs,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:10%
and they've never found a mummy
in a straight-sided pyramid,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.546 align:middle line:10%
and that doesn't deter them.

00:01:56.546 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We're told they
worshiped animals,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
but really they understood
archetypal energies and animal

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:84%
totems the way native
Indian tradition does.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And we were told
they were infantile

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
in their depictions of
things, because we're

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:84%
looking through
patriarch lenses.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we haven't known
what we were looking at.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
In the years before
quantum physics,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:84%
we couldn't possibly understand
the level of cosmology

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient
Egyptians understood.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So they were basically focused
on two things: biology, which

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.402 align:middle line:84%
is how we got
here, and then what

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
happens when we depart
this physical existence.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And cosmology, right?

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.485 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And
that's cosmology.

00:02:29.485 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's cosmology.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
highly sophisticated,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:90%
and we're just catching on.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're barely
coming to what they knew.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.139 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
a little later in the program,

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:84%
even down to the glandular
nature of our own systems

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and how it works with
consciousness and the senses,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.955 align:middle line:84%
which I can't wait
to get to that part.

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty mind-blowing,
looking into the past.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
wanted to ask you about

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.070 align:middle line:84%
is that as this new
knowledge is coming up--

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
we had a private conversation
beforehand, and both of us

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:90%
kept using the word remembrance.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And so can you talk
about your experience

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.390 align:middle line:84%
of that and working on
this project, not only just

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:84%
your own but other
people, in terms

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
of bringing this
information forward,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
where that's
actually coming from?

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, I think
that research starts with

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:90%
a hypothesis.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
But the hypothesis
can come from a hunch

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:90%
that comes from anywhere.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, I had very early
past life recall about Egypt.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I could see the
costumes and the headdresses

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot, but I
didn't know where it was.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.022 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go and
look at various books

00:03:37.022 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to realize it was
Egypt, and then I

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.896 align:middle line:84%
tried to find out
where Egypt was.

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:90%
I was just a little girl.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what's really driven my
quest is my past life memory.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I know I've had more
than one incarnation there

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:90%
in various time frames.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when people would say
things or I'd hear tour guides,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
my whole being would say, no,
no, that's not what happened.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.498 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:03:58.498 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'd start to feel sick, like
I was almost going to pass out.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, well, why
does this even concern me?

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But then when I would
stumble upon something

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
that was more of what's
in "The Pyramid Code,"

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I would feel so
fresh and so happy

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and feel like the
lights all went on.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to
really be able to discern

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
that if something made me
feel contracted and closed,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:90%
it probably wasn't true.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.097 align:middle line:84%
So this has been a very,
very long quest, 50 years.

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 50 years.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And you went on to go into
areas of research that really

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
are assisting you in
what you're doing today,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
coming even more from
the world of academia.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.804 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
as you say, that

00:04:40.804 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have
happened had you not

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.119 align:middle line:84%
had the overlay of this
experience of your own.

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And I would have to think
that many of the people

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
you've interviewed-- and I've
interviewed many of the people

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:84%
as well-- have had this
exact same experience.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.347 align:middle line:84%
They would not be spending
their entire life in this study

00:04:56.347 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
if it weren't for the fact
that there was something much

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
deeper that was inspiring
them from often an early age,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:90%
like yourself.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Did you find that?

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Absolutely.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this is our
collective remembrance

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that's actually coming forward,
which is going in the face

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of academia.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And why is it that Egypt itself
and a few key players are

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.874 align:middle line:84%
trying so hard to hold
onto this old story?

00:05:21.874 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, I think
that's what's really going

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
on everywhere is that there
seems to be propaganda.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:10%
There seems to be a story that
takes us away from the idea

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:10%
that we can be empowered.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:10%
And so patriarchy's
about power over.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:10%
It's not about
personal empowerment.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:10%
And once the dynasties started
in Egypt, it was patriarchal.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:10%
So predynastic Egypt was
actually matriarchal.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.440 align:middle line:10%
So I think it's very threatening
to the powers that be, were,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:10%
pretend, the powers
that are actually

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:10%
leaving to think that we
don't need to sell our soul.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
pay for salvation.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.130 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
God/Goddess within us,

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to
be empowered and help

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:90%
each other be empowered.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, on that
simple principle, it

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:84%
would change the
world we live in.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So basically it's
the same reason

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:84%
why information
is being withheld

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
in many other quarters,
not just alternative

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.560 align:middle line:84%
history, and medicine and
many other things as well.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, so-- Now we've
talked about what it is.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
We have these
people remembering.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:84%
We have people inspired
to take on really just

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.205 align:middle line:90%
incredible research.

00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
You know Christopher
Dunn, and Christopher Dunn

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
is one person, for example, that
is looking at these incredibly

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
exquisitely carved
features on some

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:90%
of the sculptures in Egypt.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And he is saying what you
found in the documentary

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.865 align:middle line:90%
and your research as well.

00:06:44.865 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
This is machined work,
sophisticated machinery.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a
little bit about some

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
of the technology
you stumbled across

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:90%
when you were doing this?

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, the beauty of
a Christopher Dunn is that he

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have an agenda,
and he's an engineer.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And so he's not
trying to weave it

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
into spirituality or
ancient history or anything.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
He's looking at
machine toolmarks.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
He's looking at
corners and edges

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and using a flat metal
ruler, if you will,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and shining light
underneath and seeing

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.970 align:middle line:84%
that these structures are
absolutely perfect, more

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:90%
perfect than we can do now.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And so there's so much, if
you're looking with that eye.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
There's stones in
the Valley Temple

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:84%
that have 11 different
angles on them.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.402 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 11.

00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yeah.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.134 align:middle line:90%
And it's mind-boggling.

00:07:35.134 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And concave stones
that are carved and many,

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
many different things
from all around.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.019 align:middle line:84%
And so it's clear that they
had high-level technology,

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
but it was a different
level of technology.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.690 align:middle line:84%
We expect, because we
have static electricity

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and the kinds of
machines that we have,

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:84%
that they would have
used the same ones.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But then let's say
there's something

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that was drilled with
a diamond drill bit.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
say, where's the bit?

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe we've had
three world floods,

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:90%
two world floods since then.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And if we dropped a
diamond drill bit now,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.790 align:middle line:84%
we may not even be able to
find it in the sand 10 minutes

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.908 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:09.908 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And so these
kinds of things will prove it.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you see
evidence of something

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:84%
being carved with
this or drilled,

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
then it couldn't have been done
in hard basalt with chisels.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually have two
chisels in the National Museum

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, and they're rusty, and
they've got them in the cases.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And they're basically showing
these sophisticated basalt

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.370 align:middle line:84%
statues that are extremely
hard, and they say, yep,

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.185 align:middle line:90%
that's how they built them.

00:08:33.185 --> 00:08:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They built them with
those chisels over there.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.214 align:middle line:84%
But of course,
that's impossible.

00:08:37.214 --> 00:08:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, so we have
another issue, and that

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.909 align:middle line:84%
is subtle energies
versus gross energies.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:84%
As you said, we use a lot of
electrostatic electricity.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:90%
We have AC/DC and so forth now.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.859 align:middle line:84%
But in those times, there is
evidence that they were also--

00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and this is part of
Christopher Dunn's work

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle line:84%
as well-- that these pyramids,
and one in particular,

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.280 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid, may have
been used more as a power plant.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet, people say,
well, how could that be?

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
They can't see any
wiring and the like.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about the nature
of the pyramidal structure that

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.570 align:middle line:84%
starts drawing on these subtle
energies and creating power?

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, first of all,
most of the pyramids are built

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:90%
on limestone aquifers.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And Nikola Tesla was doing
this in the early 1900s, where

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:90%
he built the Tesla Tower.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
underneath was a system

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of passageways at
45-degree angles

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.697 align:middle line:84%
that connected with
water underneath that

00:09:34.697 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
went through these
limestone aquifers.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So underneath the
Giza Plateau-- I've

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
been extremely curious my
whole career about this--

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.185 align:middle line:84%
there's a network of
passageways, some which

00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:84%
are artificial and some which
are natural, in the limestone.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
The artificial ones are
in honeycomb patterns.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the water
from the Nile, which

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:84%
used to run right at
the foot of The Sphinx,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:90%
and we see evidence--

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now that's a
good point to bring up.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.322 align:middle line:84%
What we see today
is these structures

00:10:00.322 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:84%
look like they're
miles and miles inland.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.382 align:middle line:90%
That was not the case then.

00:10:03.382 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Well, sure.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.423 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at geological
time, how long would

00:10:06.423 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
it take a river to
move eight miles?

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Because now the
Nile is eight miles

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:90%
from the nose of The Sphinx.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
However, we have the
water table percolating up

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
at the foot of The Sphinx,
and that's not new drilling.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the water
table from before.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that the
Nile would flood every year,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.504 align:middle line:84%
and so there were various times
of year when it was actually

00:10:26.504 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:90%
used as a power point.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
Nile would recede,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:84%
then it was used for
different purposes.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So the Great Pyramid
didn't have one purpose.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It's multidimensional,
multipurpose,

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
multidisciplinary, and through
an extended period of time.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So when the water was going
through these passageways,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:84%
the passageways were
made of granite,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
which excludes radon gas,
which is slightly radioactive,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.180 align:middle line:84%
but it also has a
crystalline structure.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that if you keep
running water through angles,

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:56.906 align:middle line:90%
it builds a charge.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.405 align:middle line:84%
It builds a charge
with the crystals

00:10:58.405 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:90%
and with the radon gas.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I noticed on your
documentary this zigzag pattern

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:90%
through these angles.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: But we see that
in Viktor Schauberger's work,

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
where the water's being poured
and poured and poured between

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.128 align:middle line:90%
different things.

00:11:09.128 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But the point is the
transmutation of the atom.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And so if water is hydrogen and
oxygen molecules put together,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.195 align:middle line:84%
there was something about
being able to blow that apart.

00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And so Christopher Dunn
himself will tell you

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
about these large
capacitors-- which

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:84%
is a word that we
use in microwaves.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the components
of a microwave-- that

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:90%
were in the Grand Gallery.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the water kept on
passing and building a charge

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:84%
until the water molecule
actually blew apart.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And they would harness
the hydrogen, which

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is subtle energy, which can
be contained and used again,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's implosion power
instead of explosion power.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what we tend to
do is blow things up

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and have a lot of pollution
that goes with it.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.171 align:middle line:90%
And so this was free energy.

00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the other thing
that's threatening.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Free energy.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: No utility bills.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Hawass will not
allow any teams of scientists,

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.710 align:middle line:84%
from my understanding, to go to
the top of the pyramid and even

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:07.047 align:middle line:84%
measure the energetic
outputs coming out the top.

00:12:07.047 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what I heard.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.336 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: And now Zahi's gone.

00:12:09.336 --> 00:12:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.528 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: They
have a new regime.

00:12:11.528 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a new Minister
of Antiquities,

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:90%
and my team is talking to him.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be that we get
some advantages to do that.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But I've been able to run a
study in the Great Pyramid

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and bring instrumentation,
very sensitive instrumentation,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:84%
in that was invented by Dr.
Konstantin Korotkov, who's

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:90%
been on your show.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is
electrophotonic imaging,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's also called Gaseous
Discharge Visualization, which

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:84%
is GDV/EPI, if you wanted
to look it up online.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And what it's doing
is it's measuring

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:84%
the photonic emissions
from the human body.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So he has found a way to
measure consciousness fields.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was using it to look
at the effect of the pyramid

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.879 align:middle line:84%
on the human aura and
the chakra system,

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
which is connected to
the glandular system,

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:90%
as you mentioned.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I ran a sophisticated
quantitative empirical study

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:84%
with a large enough group
to do statistical analysis,

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and so we measured
people before,

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:84%
inside the pyramid after being
in the sarcophagus for two

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
minutes, and then in
a post-test after.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And I got some remarkable,
remarkable findings

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:90%
of how the process works.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.163 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in essence, what
was it doing to the people that

00:13:18.163 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:90%
were inside that?

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, what's--
we talked about 360-- well,

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:84%
"The Pyramid Code" talks about
360 senses, and we are using 5.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience going in
the Great Pyramid since 1977,

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.290 align:middle line:84%
is that I would
become more psychic.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it would take a while
to digest the information.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that you
go in the Great Pyramid

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you
know everything.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
about making connections,

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and we call it synesthesia in
psychological studies, where

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
someone can hear a picture, see
music, smell the flowers when

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:90%
they're watching TV.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it's
cross-sensory perception.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
So syn is the cross, and
esthesia is the senses.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.375 align:middle line:84%
And so when Hakim talked
about the 360 senses,

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I started to imagine,
well, how would I

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.740 align:middle line:84%
make an animation that
would portray that?

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So I took a priestess
with her chakras,

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and I stood her inside a sphere.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But what I imagined was that
the 360 senses is full spectrum,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the points
where the sphere joins.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
almost like handles,

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:84%
handles between chakras where
one thing would inform another.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.747 align:middle line:84%
So your intuition connects
with your gut reaction,

00:14:29.747 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:90%
which connects with your--

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it must have a
synergistic effect once they

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:90%
start flowing--

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: A
synergistic effect.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --into one another.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.925 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:34.925 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Now when I looked
at the raw data after--

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.035 align:middle line:84%
now going in the sarcophagus,
when people come out they

00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:41.390 align:middle line:90%
barely can stand up.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:90%
They're completely disoriented.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
about the way

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.450 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramid was used
that was assisting initiates

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:84%
to depart from this
physical dense reality

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and to experience what it
meant to leave the physical.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Because what they wanted
to do was be conscious.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:90%
They had no word for death.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
practicing moving

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:90%
between dimensional energies.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.825 align:middle line:90%
This was what they did.

00:15:04.825 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: We've lost the
vocabulary and the scaffolding

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.650 align:middle line:90%
to even understand this.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.522 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say that
lying in the sarcophagus

00:15:12.522 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
is disorienting, because it's
almost like the chakras start

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to split apart, and
it's almost like a way

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
that people can
start to drift away

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.112 align:middle line:90%
from the third dimensional grip.

00:15:22.112 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're
talking about geometry,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.905 align:middle line:90%
mathematical proportion.

00:15:24.905 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yeah.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're talking about
the substance of the stone

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:27.485 align:middle line:90%
itself--

00:15:27.485 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --many things
that were really meticulously

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:90%
created for that purpose.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Now what was
happening, though, when

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.503 align:middle line:84%
they were inside the
pyramid and we measured

00:15:35.503 --> 00:15:37.666 align:middle line:84%
the photonic emissions
coming off their fingertips,

00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
a logarithm that

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
shows how it's affecting
their energy field,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.020 align:middle line:84%
the overall area of their energy
field, and the strength of it,

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:84%
but the energetic values of the
chakras, so the size of them,

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:90%
but the alignment.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And so one way that a person
can go out of alignment

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:90%
is toward narcissism.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:84%
They become totally
possessed with themselves.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
The other way is to be so
concerned with other people

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:90%
that you lose your own center.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And so there's something about
the splitting of the chakras

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.504 align:middle line:84%
and the alignment of
the chakras that I

00:16:06.504 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:90%
found particularly significant.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing didn't come
together until the post-test.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So when people had a
chance to integrate--

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.914 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So Korotkov's device
was measuring them before.

00:16:18.914 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yes.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did it
measure them during?

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, they
were two minutes inside

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:90%
the sarcophagus--

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:23.930 align:middle line:90%
And then?

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Immediately after.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.086 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Immediately
after the sarcophagus,

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:84%
but then the next
day at the hotel.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it was really
interesting to look at the data.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But when I did the
statistical analysis, which

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
was looking for correlations,
what we look for

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
is a strong statistical
significance,

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.810 align:middle line:84%
which means there's less
than a chance in 1,000

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:90%
that it happened by accident.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:84%
A mild significance
would be less

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
than a chance of 5%, 5 in 100
that it happened by accident.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And so what was
happening is it started

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:90%
to entrain all the chakras.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the energetic
field, the human aura

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:90%
was firing off the heart.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:90%
The heart, yes.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And you can see
these pictures on my website

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.075 align:middle line:90%
under Photos--

00:17:04.075 --> 00:17:05.991 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, they're
beautiful photos, yes.

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: --of
the actual response.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going back
in a month, a month

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
today, with a large group of 75
people-- and there may be more

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.234 align:middle line:84%
by the time we get
there-- and we're

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:84%
going to run the
same study again.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But this time, I'm going
to do a delayed post-test.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also going to be
able to measure people

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
who are in the pyramid but
don't go in the sarcophagus

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:84%
or someone who's doing the tests
and they're outside the pyramid

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
to try to get some kind of
a correlation between-- try

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
to get a deeper sense
of how it's happening,

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:90%
what's happening.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Does the time frame
work differently?

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Does the time of year
work differently?

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I bet you have a lot
of people watching right now

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.456 align:middle line:90%
thinking, ooh, I want to go.

00:17:42.456 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:90%
I want to go.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, and
I was even on Facebook,

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and I was talking about
the results of the study.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if anybody
was interested,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I could send them the paper,
and I got quite a few people--

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I bet you did.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: --asking for that.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.153 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's interesting
about that, too, is,

00:17:53.153 --> 00:17:55.990 align:middle line:84%
historically, we have to
remember that these structures

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:84%
were built only for very,
very high-level initiates,

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.500 align:middle line:90%
which included the pharaohs.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
This was not just
a matter of blood.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
They were high-level
initiates oftentimes.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And this whole notion
of the sarcophagus

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and what was passed
down historically

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the rituals
has been-- they've

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
tried to replicate
it, and it just

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.280 align:middle line:84%
doesn't work the same,
down through many

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
of the mystic orders, even
down into Freemasonry and such.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:24.516 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't work the same.

00:18:24.516 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, one of
the comments that was made

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.684 align:middle line:84%
by the trainers in Russia--
and so I had all these Skype

00:18:29.684 --> 00:18:31.600 align:middle line:84%
sessions, and everything
was spoken in English

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.312 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
spoken in Russian--

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:84%
the main trainers said, well,
people don't know how to deal

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:84%
with that kind of
energy nowadays.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.214 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, yeah, they don't.

00:18:39.214 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They don't.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: They don't even
know to be quiet in the Great

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid, because every step
becomes thunderous in there

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
resonance chamber,

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and people want to talk and open
and close zippers and all that

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:90%
and take my picture in here.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's just like no, no, no.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.081 align:middle line:84%
This isn't supposed to
be about little you.

00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:55.555 align:middle line:84%
But in all the
temples, the lower self

00:18:55.555 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:84%
would surrender
to the higher self

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:84%
in order to walk
through the temple.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And so the populace could go
into the first hypostyle hall.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But the higher-level
initiates would go back

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
to the Holy of Holies, which
represents the pineal gland.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the actual
shape and structure

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids and the
temples are representing

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:84%
the human cavities in the
body, and there was something

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.980 align:middle line:90%
about really training ourselves.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:20.969 align:middle line:90%
And so we've lost that.

00:19:20.969 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
being dumbed down.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you can't do
rituals to make up for that.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that the mystic
orders, the ones that

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
consider them--
Freemasons and so forth,

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
that do these to get to high
levels of initiation within,

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:90%
it's not the same thing.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.945 align:middle line:84%
They're missing the
energetic components of it

00:19:37.945 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:84%
in this process of the
rituals they go through.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: But the reason
is because, I think,

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:84%
in the processional cycle,
as Walter Cruttenden has been

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:84%
talking about in the Conference
on Procession and Ancient

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge, is the idea
that we are in the densest,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.605 align:middle line:90%
darkest space right now.

00:19:53.605 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And
there's many cycles.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.970 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan cycle's
coming to an end.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, the beginning
of the first dynasty in Egypt

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
coincided with the beginning
of the Mayan calendar.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we're looking at 5,000
years of Egyptian history

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:84%
locked within the dynasties,
but there's many tens

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of years
of Egyptian history.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Just looking at the age
of the pyramids alone--

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.892 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Right.

00:20:14.892 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --that's being
altered dramatically.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: It is.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It went from
5,000 then to, with Robert

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Schoch's work, kind of
inched up toward 12,000.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And talk about what
you know of now,

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what the latest
speculation is as to the age.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, if you think
about the Golden Age being

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
13,000 years ago and the flood
that happened with Atlantis,

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:90%
why were the pyramids built?

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And would we really be able
to go into such a high level

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.950 align:middle line:84%
construction effort when
there's a world flood?

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.419 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't make sense.

00:20:48.419 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It would have to have been
built in a golden age,

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
or else we wouldn't have
had the energetic fields

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.820 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do it.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:10%
And so that lends itself to
another whole processional

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.940 align:middle line:10%
cycle, and so it
could be 39,000 years.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:10%
Hakim used to say 52,000 years.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And even John
Anthony West would say 39,000.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Right.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:07.918 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But Hakim is holding
that knowledge

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:90%
as a shaman of that culture.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And I'm inclined
to agree with him that 52,000

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.470 align:middle line:90%
years that sort of makes sense.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
looking at the year

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:84%
that Mr. and Mrs. Poseidon
decided to commission the XYZ

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Company to build this pyramid.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It's more a whole
energetic that would

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
have happened
during a golden age.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a worldwide
thing, that there's

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.096 align:middle line:90%
pyramids all over the world.

00:21:39.096 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And more and more people
are finding pyramids

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:90%
by looking at Google Earth.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:90%
There's pyramids all over.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
there was a unified field

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
in a time when the energetics
were far more refined,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
in a way that we
can't even understand.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So in my past life
memories, we didn't talk.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
We sent pictures, and we chirped
like birds to express emotion,

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.390 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't need to speak
language because we already

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:90%
could see each other's thoughts.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And we could send
sophisticated pictures.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot to even this
transmutation of the atom

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking
about before,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.471 align:middle line:90%
because we're made of water.

00:22:12.471 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And so when the high-level
initiates reached a certain

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
level, they were able to
actually transmute the atom

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:84%
within their body, which
lent itself to telepathy

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.909 align:middle line:90%
and bilocation--

00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Teleportation.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: --teleportation,
manifestation, alchemy,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.832 align:middle line:84%
and levitation, which
is anti-gravity.

00:22:28.832 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And so once they
were able to plug into one,

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:90%
these abilities came to them.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So I find it interesting
in shows like "Heroes"

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:84%
where they each
have one ability,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:90%
but they don't all have them.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is
it's my conviction

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that once the high-level
initiates were

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
able to step into the general
transmutation of the atom,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:84%
they were able to do
all of these things.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Now even in the Vedic texts
they talk about the siddhis--

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:84%
S-I-D-D-H-I-- and those
are these abilities.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of
beyond our scope.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:84%
However, the ancient
Egyptians have

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
got all kinds of frescoes that
describe this whole thing.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:90%
So the ka is the body double.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes
a high-level being

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:84%
can split their ka
in maybe five places

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and go and share dreams and
travel around and do things.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:84%
The ba is the part
of the soul that

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.520 align:middle line:84%
exists whether we have
this incarnation or not.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And so the Egyptians
really understood that,

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.884 align:middle line:90%
and they practiced it.

00:23:26.884 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They were masterful
at those projections.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.091 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:23:30.091 --> 00:23:32.075 align:middle line:84%
But they worked on it,
and they understood

00:23:32.075 --> 00:23:32.950 align:middle line:90%
the importance of it.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So for us in the Council
of Nicea in 323 AD,

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.595 align:middle line:84%
Emperor Constantine
outlawed reincarnation.

00:23:39.595 --> 00:23:42.721 align:middle line:84%
And if you mentioned it,
you could get killed.

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not
doing that anymore.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And so all of
these different systems have

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
strategically stripped us
of even the conception that

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:90%
we're capable of doing this.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So then we go and look at the
ancient Egyptian material,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:90%
and we don't understand it.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But slowly we're
coming back to that

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:84%
as we understand quantum physics
and various other sciences.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the study
of all subtle energies,

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
both in the physical body
and the exterior part.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind if we
run a little clip?

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip, and
it's referring here--

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk a little bit more
about technology in a minute,

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's talking
about the pyramids

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
able to produce.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's John
Burke talking about it.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.504 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to that
little video clip.

00:24:21.504 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.336 align:middle line:84%
>> JOHN BURKE: In the
condition of the pyramids now,

00:24:24.336 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:84%
stripped of those smooth
insulating outer casings,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.170 align:middle line:84%
it's going to leak electrical
air about as well as a car

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:90%
radiator radiates heat.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It's almost perfectly
designed to weaken that.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet still you get
these reports of people,

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:44.016 align:middle line:84%
like Siemens, who was one of
the pioneers of electricity.

00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:44.890 align:middle line:90%
He was an Englishman.

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.306 align:middle line:84%
There's even a
unit of electrical,

00:24:46.306 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I believe, resistance named
after him called the Siemens.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:84%
He was on top of the
Great Pyramid, I think,

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
during the 1880s, and they began
to notice that when his Arab

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.650 align:middle line:84%
guide stood up and spread his
fingers, they'd hear a ringing,

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and when he closed
them, you wouldn't.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And he stood up, and he could
sense the literal electricity

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.650 align:middle line:90%
in the air.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And on the spot, he improvised
an instant laden jar,

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
earliest things they used

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:90%
to use to store electric charge.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:21.890 align:middle line:10%
And he did it by opening a wine
bottle, wetting some newspaper,

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.300 align:middle line:10%
wrapping the wet newspaper
around the glass wine bottle,

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.370 align:middle line:10%
and holding the wine
bottle up above his head

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:10%
until sparks started to
issue from the wine bottle.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
his Arab guide

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:84%
started accusing him of
things like witchcraft.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They got into a
physical struggle,

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and he accidentally
touched one of the guides

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.450 align:middle line:84%
with the charged wine bottle,
and it knocked the man

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:84%
to the ground and unconscious
for a short period, after which

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:90%
they took off down the pyramid.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But there was, in other words,
a professional scientist

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:84%
familiar with electricity in its
rudimentary but accurate forms

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:84%
sensing exactly that, even
in this ruined condition

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.631 align:middle line:90%
that the pyramid's in today.

00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Many engineers in
the know feel that we should be

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
taking clues from the ancients
with all they were able to do

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:90%
at that period of time.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
wonder, as he just said,

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:16.775 align:middle line:84%
John Burke, he was saying
that the pyramids, are still--

00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
they're still emitting--
they can still

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:84%
detect these energies,
even after they've

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
used dynamite to blow
portions of them up and such.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that for just a moment?

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.622 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Many pyramids
are dead, if you will,

00:26:29.622 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:84%
some pyramids
throughout the world.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And pyramids that
were replicated

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:84%
they were built in later time
periods just aren't as active.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And so John Burke talks
about the populous bringing

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
seeds to the temples in the
pyramids for the shamans

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.160 align:middle line:84%
to charge them, and
they would actually

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.743 align:middle line:84%
take them into the
pyramids, take them

00:26:46.743 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:90%
to the tops of the pyramids.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they
compared the yields

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.285 align:middle line:84%
from the crops of the
pyramids that-- from the seeds

00:26:52.285 --> 00:26:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that had been in the pyramids
and the seeds that had not,

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:90%
and it was just dramatic.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, it
was very dramatic.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed John
a long time ago,

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and we captured some
of those images.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:84%
He shared them with
us as well, and it

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.540 align:middle line:84%
was shocking the
amount of growth

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:90%
that those charged seeds got.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.499 align:middle line:84%
So these pyramids are
used for this purpose--

00:27:07.499 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk about
it a little bit later on-- even

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:10.979 align:middle line:90%
today, right?

00:27:10.979 --> 00:27:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Well, that's right.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But the shocking
part, to me, was

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.272 align:middle line:84%
that some pyramids
don't work, and that's

00:27:16.272 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:90%
because they weren't aligned.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramid technology
is actually quite specific.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's true that the Great
Pyramid has been damaged,

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.475 align:middle line:84%
and it tends to be the
strongest during eclipses,

00:27:26.475 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:84%
well, yes, eclipses, but
solstices and equinoxes

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.400 align:middle line:90%
plus or minus six days.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And so there's something
about the alignment

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and
the technology that

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:84%
is relating to
the galaxy itself.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And wouldn't it
also be working with the Earth

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.640 align:middle line:90%
and the waters underneath?

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.090 align:middle line:90%
It all goes together.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: The Telluric
energies of the Earth

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and the
continuity/discontinuities,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.132 align:middle line:90%
which is where ley lines meet.

00:27:51.132 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.754 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yes, absolutely.

00:27:53.754 --> 00:27:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're connected
to other pyramids,

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're connected to our
place in the galaxy itself.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at the
linguistic properties

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
of the word for pyramid in the
ancient Suf language, which

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.040 align:middle line:84%
isn't Arabic,
Per-Neter is the name

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.630 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid, which
is the house of nature.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And what's true is the pyramid
replicates things and functions

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.120 align:middle line:84%
of the human body and
functions of the planet,

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.799 align:middle line:84%
functions of the solar system,
and functions of the galaxy.

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going to
get into that in just a moment.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
little two-minute break,

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.640 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be right back.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.715 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be talking
about not just the chakras

00:28:27.715 --> 00:28:32.180 align:middle line:84%
but the glandular system and
these 360 senses that we once

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:90%
possessed.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.098 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:28:34.098 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:90%


00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:84%
We're always talking about
our five-sense world.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.318 align:middle line:84%
And if we really
get cooking, we'll

00:28:45.318 --> 00:28:47.255 align:middle line:84%
talk about our
sixth sense, right?

00:28:47.255 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Our sixth sense.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:53.020 align:middle line:10%
But as you have
found, we once had--

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:10%
and this was a
very long time ago,

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:10%
and not everybody
probably, maybe more

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:10%
the initiates-- had
access to 360 senses.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.202 align:middle line:84%
Now that's beyond
our comprehension,

00:29:03.202 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, as
to where we are now

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:90%
in this dark age, so to speak.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.579 align:middle line:84%
Talk about these senses
and the nature of them.

00:29:09.579 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:10%
>> BOULTER: Well, I
think it's synesthesia,

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:10%
which is a combination between
two senses, or more than two,

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:10%
and a really deep
sense of knowing.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:10%
And so, for us, knowing
in the academic sense

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:10%
is getting the answer
that the teacher has.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:10%
It's not about
knowing that we know

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:10%
or knowing that we
know that we know, like

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.840 align:middle line:10%
a profound sense of something
being true or not true.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:84%
In our culture, if we don't
get caught, it's not wrong.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty low
standard, by the way.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.915 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: It's a
pretty low standard.

00:29:39.915 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.838 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And so what the
Egyptians were looking to be is

00:29:42.838 --> 00:29:43.500 align:middle line:90%
transparent.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they even talked
about the ceremony

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.680 align:middle line:84%
of the weighing of the hearts,
which was a way that they

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
taught the populace
to live well.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is if when
you passed and you dropped

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
your physical body, they'd
say let's have your heart,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and they would weigh it on a
scale, Maat's scale, a balance,

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.725 align:middle line:90%
with the feather of truth.

00:30:00.725 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And if your heart
was heavy, they

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't want you
on the other side.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you'd done
something immoral

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.990 align:middle line:84%
or if you'd taken from someone
or if you'd been selfish,

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:84%
that was the worst
possible thing,

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.990 align:middle line:84%
because then you
couldn't progress

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.270 align:middle line:84%
to go into other
dimensional spheres.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So it was very important
to the ancient Egyptians

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that they lived in
such a way that they

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
were moral and fair and
spiritual and connected

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.150 align:middle line:90%
to spirit.

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:26.912 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea that
spirit's outside of us, what

00:30:26.912 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:84%
we've been taught
through religions

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and we have to pay someone
to connect with ourselves,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.160 align:middle line:90%
it's just corruption.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a way that distracts us.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.954 align:middle line:84%
And so if someone was in
full knowing and almost

00:30:39.954 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:84%
like an owl, can turn their
head all the way around,

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.622 align:middle line:84%
which means you can see with the
eyes in the back of your head,

00:30:45.622 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:84%
or the phone rings
and you know who

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.260 align:middle line:84%
it is without looking
at the caller ID,

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.910 align:middle line:90%
there's ways that we know.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:53.922 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a muscle.

00:30:53.922 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And so if people think if you
can't see it, it's not there,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.171 align:middle line:84%
they don't cultivate
these kinds of things.

00:30:58.171 --> 00:30:59.807 align:middle line:84%
But we have the same
DNA as they had,

00:30:59.807 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I think
is really important.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Now we are living
in denser times,

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.750 align:middle line:84%
but as we come up upon the
galactic alignment, December

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:84%
21, 2012 and the
shift, I think that we

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
are going to have access to
these more refined energies.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
However, we perceive
things with our senses,

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
we think about certain
things in negative ways,

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and so our perception is
saying, nope, that's not there.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to cultivate
what the ancient Egyptians

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:84%
understood, we have
to be very pure.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.700 align:middle line:90%
We have to be very conscious.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Now consciousness isn't the
highest value for us at all.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Profit is.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:84%
But if consciousness
was the highest value,

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.770 align:middle line:90%
think about how we would change.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.310 align:middle line:84%
If it was really important
to be aware of everything

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:47.940 align:middle line:84%
all the time, people's motives
and how everything worked,

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.920 align:middle line:90%
that changes things.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.294 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
your own thoughts.

00:31:50.294 --> 00:31:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Having diligence
to be able to audit your own

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:59.040 align:middle line:84%
thoughts and discard
what is not working,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.890 align:middle line:84%
which isn't functional, which
would not weigh well against

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:02.390 align:middle line:90%
the feather.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.473 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Well, exactly.

00:32:03.473 --> 00:32:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Now
thought is creative.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.660 align:middle line:84%
What we talk about,
we think about.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.160 align:middle line:84%
What we think about,
we bring about.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So when people say, oh,
I'll never get that right

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:84%
or, oh, one day I'm going
to kill myself doing that,

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I say cancel, clear.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Because that imprint of those
words has gone into space,

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and you can see people
programming themselves

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.674 align:middle line:90%
for negativity.

00:32:24.674 --> 00:32:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And they
get away with it.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:90%
And then negative things happen.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So as I say, we can't
afford the luxury

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.070 align:middle line:84%
of a single negative thought,
because brain studies will

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:36.021 align:middle line:84%
show the brain only
says yes, boss.

00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at a
crystalline structure--

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:40.371 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:32:40.371 --> 00:32:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --ultimately within
our being, within our body.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people understand
crystals much better now

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.500 align:middle line:90%
in the last 20 years.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:84%
We have some amethyst sitting
at the end of the table here.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about crystal
is it's an amplifier, right?

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies--
our own bodies have

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.244 align:middle line:84%
to be tuners and amplifiers
for whatever it is we

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:01.410 align:middle line:90%
choose to program them with.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.011 align:middle line:90%
It's all programming, is it not?

00:33:03.011 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Well, it is.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But this crystalline
matrix is something

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.180 align:middle line:84%
that existed in
the Golden Age when

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:90%
the energy was far more refined.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And we are apparently
coming back into that.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Now do we have any
proof that we're

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.960 align:middle line:84%
coming into a
crystalline matrix?

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.525 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you a little story.

00:33:18.525 --> 00:33:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Please do.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Last week I went
for live blood analysis,

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and red blood cells were all
really active and all that.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
found a patch where

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.140 align:middle line:84%
there was effects of radiation,
which was a little bit scary.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But when she pulled out
from the blood analysis,

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.840 align:middle line:84%
it almost looked like
when you look at the Earth

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:84%
when it's got the lights
at night from a distance.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.662 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, what are
all those little crystals?

00:33:40.662 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:42.994 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, never mind.

00:33:42.994 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Because she didn't
understand it.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But it made this incredible
beautiful pattern

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.470 align:middle line:84%
of these tiny crystals
throughout my blood.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And I walked away from
that, and I thought, hey,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:56.712 align:middle line:84%
that may be where we're heading
and what's really going on.

00:33:56.712 --> 00:33:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
Harvey Bigelsen's work.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Is it?

00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.821 align:middle line:84%
You need to get
together with Harvey.

00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:01.696 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, yes.

00:34:01.696 --> 00:34:02.321 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: OK.

00:34:02.321 --> 00:34:03.779 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hadn't
heard that anywhere,

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:90%
but I saw it with my own eyes.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we are
restructuring in a way,

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and there are people
who are waking up,

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.550 align:middle line:84%
who are meditating a lot,
eating right, and changing

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.469 align:middle line:84%
and allowing themselves
to expand in these senses.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea that we
can become more psychic,

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:24.360 align:middle line:84%
that we can know things, we can
know when an appointment's not

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:84%
going to happen or when
someone says, yeah, I'll do it,

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.250 align:middle line:84%
we know they won't, because
they've closed their eyes

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.875 align:middle line:84%
and they've shut
themselves off or they

00:34:30.875 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
stop breathing-- we can perceive
each other in many ways,

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.980 align:middle line:84%
like when people
hold themselves--

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and if you start to look at
all these different signs

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.380 align:middle line:84%
that people are
giving us, we can

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.404 align:middle line:84%
hear what they're not
saying, if you will.

00:34:41.404 --> 00:34:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And so that's part of these
360 degrees-- 360 senses,

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:84%
not just degrees, that
can be used 360 degrees.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally that has been
aligned more with femininity,

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:84%
the right side of
the brain, this kind

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:90%
of open, intuitive way.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And back in that day, we
were looking more at a

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.140 align:middle line:84%
matriarchy, as you say
in predynastic Egypt

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.300 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And when there was
the feminine that

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.070 align:middle line:84%
was in the lead, so to speak,
it wasn't a dominance issue,

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:19.236 align:middle line:84%
as with the patriarchy where
the patriarchy means they rule,

00:35:19.236 --> 00:35:20.750 align:middle line:90%
the patriarchy rules.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a dominant theme.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.910 align:middle line:84%
But in matriarchy, as you
explain in the documentary,

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.970 align:middle line:84%
it's more about
bringing forth balance

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.460 align:middle line:84%
between the sacred feminine
and the sacred masculine,

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:90%
as I understand it.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.091 align:middle line:84%
And could you talk
about that a little bit?

00:35:33.091 --> 00:35:35.067 align:middle line:84%
We have a lovely
graphic in that too.

00:35:35.067 --> 00:35:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, people think
that matriarchy is the opposite

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:39.983 align:middle line:84%
of patriarchy, and women are
going to take over and drag

00:35:39.983 --> 00:35:41.120 align:middle line:90%
the men around by whatever.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:41.475 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Their hair.

00:35:41.475 --> 00:35:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: [LAUGHS]
Their hair, exactly.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And really what the
matriarchal cultures insisted

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.470 align:middle line:84%
was on leaving more for
children and the children

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:55.260 align:middle line:84%
respecting the elders
and protecting the Earth,

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.300 align:middle line:84%
working in harmony
with everyone,

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and the sacred
masculine in balance

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.030 align:middle line:90%
with the sacred feminine.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So there was an
understanding that a woman

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.880 align:middle line:84%
has a sacred
masculine inside her,

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:84%
a man has a sacred
feminine inside him,

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and that the two
sides of the brain

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:10.470 align:middle line:90%
have to function together.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea of
the corpus callosum

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that works between them
is the communication

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.030 align:middle line:84%
between the two
sides of the brain.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the Egyptians
even had these snakes.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.550 align:middle line:84%
They would wear these
crowns, and there'd

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.510 align:middle line:84%
be a serpent that
would go across the two

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.640 align:middle line:84%
sides of the brain and
come out the third eye.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.036 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is brilliant,
and it's talking about that.

00:36:30.036 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And when they looked at the
scarab, the top of the scarab

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.670 align:middle line:90%
looks like the top of the brain.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the frontal
lobes, and then you've

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.970 align:middle line:90%
got the two sides of the brain.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:39.289 align:middle line:84%
But in patriarchy, oh,
let's lop off the feminine.

00:36:39.289 --> 00:36:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's just get rid of it.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible's like, the
sacred feminine, never

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:84%
mind, Mary Magdalen was
a prostitute, let's just

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:44.794 align:middle line:90%
forget it.

00:36:44.794 --> 00:36:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And so this reading, writing,
arithmetic, what you can see

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:51.100 align:middle line:84%
is there, and all the ways that
if it's concrete, it exists

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.510 align:middle line:84%
is just a really
good way to hide.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.410 align:middle line:84%
But the other side
of the brain is

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:58.690 align:middle line:84%
symbols and dreams and
periodicity instead

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:84%
of linear time
and all the things

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that bring these
secrets forward.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea
insists on a balance.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when you get to
the arches at the entrance

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.680 align:middle line:84%
to any temple, you'll
see a winged disk.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And the wings are the
vulture, the sacred feminine,

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and the snake is the
sacred masculine.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is you cannot
walk through these gates to go

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.640 align:middle line:84%
into the temple without dropping
the lower self and appealing

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to the higher self that
insists on a balance between

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:34.366 align:middle line:90%
the masculine and the feminine.

00:37:34.366 --> 00:37:35.990 align:middle line:84%
That's where spiritual
work can happen.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.906 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and
that's what's functional.

00:37:37.906 --> 00:37:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, I recently
interviewed Patrick Flanagan,

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and when he was a young
kid, he is believed to be

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and has all of the
memory of Nikola Tesla.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the areas of
information he brought forward

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.190 align:middle line:84%
was the understanding of the
pyramids at a very early age.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And another one was something
called a neurophone.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And what was
interesting about that--

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.375 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't put it
together until you

00:38:01.375 --> 00:38:04.479 align:middle line:84%
were saying this, what
they were doing in Egypt.

00:38:04.479 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about
snake going back and forth

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.320 align:middle line:84%
between the hemispheres
of the brain--

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:84%
is this neurophone
is able to reduce

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:13.424 align:middle line:84%
the synapse time
of communication

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:15.590 align:middle line:84%
between the right and left
hemispheres of the brain.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.812 align:middle line:84%
And the net effect is a huge
expansion of consciousness

00:38:18.812 --> 00:38:21.080 align:middle line:90%
and, not only that, even IQ.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
must be a memory of his,

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:26.670 align:middle line:84%
first of all, to have brought
this technology forward,

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:84%
but this must have
been embedded in what

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:90%
was taught in those days.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:31.724 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Absolutely.

00:38:31.724 --> 00:38:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And the masculine
and the feminine

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.050 align:middle line:84%
were trained separately,
and then they

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.920 align:middle line:84%
would come together
in the Band of Peace

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.420 align:middle line:90%
where the Pyramid Fields were.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were like the
human divining rods,

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
so that the cosmic
energy couldn't

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.464 align:middle line:84%
come into the Telluric realm
unless the human divining

00:38:47.464 --> 00:38:49.130 align:middle line:84%
rod was there and the
opposite was true.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth energy would
go up into the cosmos,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:84%
but through the beings
of the sacred masculine

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and the sacred feminine join
together in a Tantric sense.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.339 align:middle line:84%
And all of this was exercised,
and so the initiates

00:39:03.339 --> 00:39:03.880 align:middle line:90%
were trained.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you can imagine hundreds
or thousands of initiates

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:84%
standing near the pyramids and
the sound and light technology

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that would have gone on and
how each pyramid has got

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:19.620 align:middle line:84%
a different angle, and the
position of the inner chambers

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.120 align:middle line:84%
is different, and the number
of inner chambers is different.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So when they look
at the Bent Pyramid,

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:25.050 align:middle line:84%
they say, oh,
well, the Egyptians

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:26.510 align:middle line:84%
were just practicing
building pyramids,

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't really
know what they were doing.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They didn't
do anything by accident.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:29.853 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Exactly.

00:39:29.853 --> 00:39:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And that they
changed their mind.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:33.165 align:middle line:90%
And that's infantile.

00:39:33.165 --> 00:39:35.290 align:middle line:84%
The projection is that the
Egyptians were infantile

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.998 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't really
know how to do it.

00:39:36.998 --> 00:39:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's still people
who repeat that, people

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.040 align:middle line:84%
who think they're in the
alternative media and all this,

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.123 align:middle line:84%
and they're still repeating
those sorts of things.

00:39:43.123 --> 00:39:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you can
imagine a huge wind

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.380 align:middle line:84%
harp and even toning coming
out, the voices of the ancients,

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and all of this
working together,

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:56.260 align:middle line:84%
well, they used to wear
the bands-- the metal bands

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.317 align:middle line:84%
on their wrists and on
their ankles, and, to me,

00:39:59.317 --> 00:40:00.900 align:middle line:84%
my understanding of
that was that they

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.090 align:middle line:90%
could hold the energy.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they would
get electromagneticuted.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they would stand
very straight and tall,

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and they would literally be
harnessing this energy that

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:11.980 align:middle line:84%
was moving, and it would be
passing through their beings.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were
increasing their capacity

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.390 align:middle line:84%
to tolerate this
amount of energy, which

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.050 align:middle line:84%
is why, when you see
reenactments in old movies,

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:22.280 align:middle line:84%
like "Cleopatra," they just
got us standing around.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.540 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea what
was really going on.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And once a high-level initiate
got to the Pyramid Fields,

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.170 align:middle line:84%
they were there for
their whole life,

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.197 align:middle line:84%
and they were in
service to humanity.

00:40:31.197 --> 00:40:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Those were the
priests and priestesses.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.404 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Those were the
priests and priestesses,

00:40:35.404 --> 00:40:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and there were still farmers
and people in villages.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:41.926 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing was
like a huge energy machine

00:40:41.926 --> 00:40:43.300 align:middle line:84%
that was helping
the whole planet

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and regulating the
energy for everyone.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk
about another area

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.760 align:middle line:84%
which has to do
with the matriarchy.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.510 align:middle line:90%
So this was predynastic.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Once the dynasties
were established,

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.840 align:middle line:84%
they moved into a period
of the patriarchy.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.970 align:middle line:84%
But then again, in
the 18th Dynasty,

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:06.380 align:middle line:84%
which is probably best depicted
by Nefertiti and Akhenaten,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.910 align:middle line:84%
there was a resurgence
of the matriarchy,

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.290 align:middle line:84%
as you state in
your documentary.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us the background
on that, what they brought in,

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.810 align:middle line:84%
what that life at
Amarna was like,

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.640 align:middle line:90%
and what happened to them?

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.232 align:middle line:90%
And please, take some time.

00:41:19.232 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, let's just
look a little bit before that.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:25.530 align:middle line:84%
We had Hatshepsut, and she
was queen in her own right,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.040 align:middle line:90%
and she became pharaoh.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And at her temple at Deir
el-Bahari outside of Luxor,

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.470 align:middle line:84%
there is a whole hall
that has the story

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.380 align:middle line:90%
of her being a starseed.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And so her story is that her
father's body was taken over

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.640 align:middle line:84%
by a high-level being who
impregnated her mother,

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, she
was half starseed.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And so she began
with that premise.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you start seeing
the distended skulls, which

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.660 align:middle line:84%
allows for a larger
pineal gland, which

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.250 align:middle line:84%
allows for these greater
senses and a greater connection

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.050 align:middle line:90%
with the spirit beings.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.560 align:middle line:10%
So you go down a little bit
further down the 18th Dynasty--

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:10%
it's all the same dynasty-- then
there are images that I just

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:11.820 align:middle line:10%
saw last time when I was in
Egypt at a temple of Amenhotep

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.210 align:middle line:10%
II, who was Akhenaten's
grandfather.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:15.460 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Grandfather, right.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.085 align:middle line:10%
>> BOULTER: OK?

00:42:16.085 --> 00:42:17.740 align:middle line:10%
Amenhotep III was the father.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.260 align:middle line:10%
So what we have here, if you
really start looking at it,

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:24.000 align:middle line:10%
is people who started
remembering, the genetic code

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.920 align:middle line:10%
passing down, and this
idea that we could be more.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And so these images are being
depicted on the temple walls.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So Amenhotep III, he did
some prolific building.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And even in the work that
Christoper Dunn does,

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:84%
he keeps talking
about it being Ramses,

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.030 align:middle line:84%
but I think it was
actually Amenhotep III who

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.920 align:middle line:84%
made these statues,
and Ramses came along

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.842 align:middle line:84%
and took his name
off and put his on.

00:42:45.842 --> 00:42:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: That's one of the
first times when I was standing

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.070 align:middle line:84%
at the Luxor Temple and I felt
like I was going to pass out,

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.528 align:middle line:84%
because I'm like
that's not Ramses.

00:42:51.528 --> 00:42:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who's talking
to me, but that's not Ramses.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And so Christopher's admitted
that to me with a big smile.

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And so then Queen
Tiye and Amenhotep III laid

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:90%
the ground.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:03.840 align:middle line:90%
He married--

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That was the mother.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.315 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: That was
the mother of Akhenaten.

00:43:06.315 --> 00:43:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And he married many
wives in various lines.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.395 align:middle line:84%
And so he was a
prolific builder.

00:43:10.395 --> 00:43:15.450 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of peace,
and all the lands were safe,

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.030 align:middle line:90%
and it was a change.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:19.645 align:middle line:84%
And so they started
to convince Akhenaten,

00:43:19.645 --> 00:43:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and he was born Amenhotep IV.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.160 align:middle line:90%
And so Amun is the dark.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Even in the five
Egyptian cycles,

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.900 align:middle line:90%
we're just coming out of Amun.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.970 align:middle line:84%
As we pass out of this
dark phase right now,

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.020 align:middle line:84%
the next thing is Heper,
which is the balanced brain,

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.020 align:middle line:84%
represented by the
scarab, and it means dawn.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:38.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
phases of the sun that

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.400 align:middle line:84%
go through a day, a
year, and a larger cycle.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So they followed the cycles
of Sirius and various things.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:54.062 align:middle line:84%
So the Amun period was
darkness, shadow, very much

00:43:54.062 --> 00:43:55.520 align:middle line:84%
like the Catholic
Church, where you

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.790 align:middle line:84%
had to pay half your
harvest to the temple

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:03.970 align:middle line:84%
to ensure a proper burial
and a proper salvation.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
making people pay

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.550 align:middle line:90%
and making people disempowered.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So they had a
Nilometer, and they

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:84%
would show how high
the Nile went up,

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.781 align:middle line:84%
and then that would say how much
grain there was going to be.

00:44:14.781 --> 00:44:18.197 align:middle line:84%
And people would
willingly give their grain

00:44:18.197 --> 00:44:20.780 align:middle line:84%
to the temple in order to ensure
their salvation, because they

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.350 align:middle line:84%
were told that they
couldn't do it on their own.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And so here comes
the Amun priesthood

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.450 align:middle line:84%
getting rich, becoming
more and more corrupt,

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:29.105 align:middle line:84%
telling people they
know less and less.

00:44:29.105 --> 00:44:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And so Akhenaten and
Nefertiti said, you know what?

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you had to
pay to each of the gods, too.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:34.088 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Every god that they
employed, you had to pay to.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.861 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:44:37.861 --> 00:44:40.247 align:middle line:84%
And so when they say that
Akhenaten started the one god

00:44:40.247 --> 00:44:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and they closed the temples
and got rid of all the gods,

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.995 align:middle line:84%
they didn't get rid
of all the gods.

00:44:43.995 --> 00:44:44.820 align:middle line:90%
The gods are all still there.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.910 align:middle line:84%
The gods and goddesses and
Hathor and Isis and all of them

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:47.720 align:middle line:90%
are still there.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got this
very narrow view,

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and people really have given
Akhenaten a really rough time.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:57.000 align:middle line:84%
But that stands to reason in
a culture of propaganda that's

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.280 align:middle line:84%
trying to say don't look
over here, look over here.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:44:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And it's
all very confusing,

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.953 align:middle line:84%
and people go along with it
and repeat what they've seen

00:45:02.953 --> 00:45:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and what they've
read, and it's wrong.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is--
talk about the lifestyle

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.870 align:middle line:84%
at that time, the
change in lifestyle,

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:12.126 align:middle line:90%
just the beauty alone.

00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: OK.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:14.458 align:middle line:84%
So one of things that
was going to happen

00:45:14.458 --> 00:45:19.370 align:middle line:84%
is every Sothic cycle the
capital of the country

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:23.050 align:middle line:84%
moved from Thebes, which is
now Karnak, up to Heliopolis,

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and this was going
to be a time when

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:28.515 align:middle line:84%
it was incumbent upon Akhenaten
to go and make this change.

00:45:28.515 --> 00:45:29.640 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you know what?

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.740 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing's
going to fall apart.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.864 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing is corrupt.

00:45:31.864 --> 00:45:33.000 align:middle line:90%
We're going to start over.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So they picked a place
called Akhetaten,

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:38.500 align:middle line:84%
which is the rising of
the sun in the middle,

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.579 align:middle line:84%
and they went on the
other side of the Nile,

00:45:40.579 --> 00:45:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and they decided
that they were going

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to build a new commune,
whatever you want to call it.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And there was up to 40,000
people living there.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:52.375 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is they
stripped the values of the Amun

00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:55.360 align:middle line:84%
priesthood, they closed
the temples, and they said,

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.190 align:middle line:90%
we are not doing this with you.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.460 align:middle line:90%
We're starting over.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And so at Amarna it was
absolutely equal, beautiful.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.669 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Men and women.

00:46:04.669 --> 00:46:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Everybody
was in balance.

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was happy.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.650 align:middle line:84%
If you were an artisan,
you happily did that,

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:11.992 align:middle line:90%
and everybody had their roles.

00:46:11.992 --> 00:46:13.200 align:middle line:90%
But there was no competition.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.241 align:middle line:90%
It was all collaborative.

00:46:14.241 --> 00:46:14.830 align:middle line:90%
It was all--

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Peaceful?

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER:
--cooperative, peaceful.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And we have not had peace
since then, I emphasize.

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.469 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
the higher level.

00:46:23.469 --> 00:46:25.010 align:middle line:84%
They were interested
in solar energy,

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:28.610 align:middle line:84%
so you see the hands coming
off the Aten reaching down

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:29.110 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:31.193 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, he was
just worshipping the sun.

00:46:31.193 --> 00:46:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they were just sun--

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.000 align:middle line:84%
He understood it
multi-dimensionally.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yeah.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.800 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They were
utilizing it on many levels is

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:36.480 align:middle line:90%
my understanding.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.021 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And the callousness
with which they speak of them

00:46:39.021 --> 00:46:42.790 align:middle line:84%
is just-- they say he was
disfigured and he was crazy

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.990 align:middle line:90%
and deformed.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:47.410 align:middle line:84%
He was brilliant
and enlightened,

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:48.500 align:middle line:90%
and they lived in peace.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Amun priesthood
were just scavenging around

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.800 align:middle line:84%
like ferrets trying to get
that back, and they plotted,

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and they were really
trying to overthrow

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Nefertiti and Akhenaten.

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, they
were successful.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But King Tut, he started
out Tut-Ankh-Aten, OK?

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not Tut-Ankh-Amun.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:12.255 align:middle line:84%
But then they really did a
number and attacked Akhenaten

00:47:12.255 --> 00:47:12.880 align:middle line:90%
and killed him.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So when Zahi Hawass
says, oh, yeah,

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.330 align:middle line:84%
we found the mummy
of-- they're going

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:17.550 align:middle line:90%
to find the mummy of Akhenaten.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.341 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing a
skeleton, and they're

00:47:19.341 --> 00:47:23.387 align:middle line:84%
trying to prove that
Akhenaten was Tut's father--

00:47:23.387 --> 00:47:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Tut's father and all that.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.610 align:middle line:90%
But it's just--

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They tried to do
the same thing with Nefertiti.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Found a little
skeleton somewhere and said

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:30.050 align:middle line:90%
must be her.

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.505 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:30.505 --> 00:47:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They went about
it the wrong way.

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.566 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And there's no doubt
that the person that they found

00:47:34.566 --> 00:47:37.390 align:middle line:84%
that they thought was Nefertiti
was in that high court,

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:40.805 align:middle line:84%
probably knew her, maybe had
some beads that she had had

00:47:40.805 --> 00:47:43.510 align:middle line:84%
or seen and was from
the Amarna period.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did
in the North Palace--

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and this is Queen Tiye,
Nefertiti, and the way

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:52.872 align:middle line:84%
they had it there--
they raised Tut.

00:47:52.872 --> 00:47:54.080 align:middle line:90%
There was a shortage of boy--

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was
raised in Amarna.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yes.

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: There was
a shortage of boys.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.460 align:middle line:84%
There was something going on
with an infertility, which

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.270 align:middle line:84%
was showing up in
Hatshepsut's time as well,

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.070 align:middle line:84%
which is why in a
patriarchal Egypt

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:09.180 align:middle line:84%
she ended up being pharaoh,
and then they destroyed all

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.700 align:middle line:84%
her statues, and
that's another--

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Nefertiti
and Akhenaten had all girls.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.005 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And
they had all girls.

00:48:14.005 --> 00:48:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And so in
my past life memories,

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:18.610 align:middle line:84%
the birthing pools
were blood baths,

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and the boys didn't last
and they didn't live.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that
Tut as a young boy

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.920 align:middle line:84%
was going to be one of
the only chances they had.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And if the Amun priesthood
took over again,

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.060 align:middle line:84%
he needed to look like
he understood both.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So he was trained
to walk both paths.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when they found out that
he was actually of the Aten,

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.040 align:middle line:90%
they just knocked him off.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.509 align:middle line:84%
However, they took
furniture from Amarna,

00:48:39.509 --> 00:48:41.050 align:middle line:84%
they went to the
Valley of the Kings,

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and there was a small
cache of mummies.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:46.560 align:middle line:84%
They put those somewhere else--
they just threw them away--

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and they loaded up all this
furniture from the Amarna

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.130 align:middle line:84%
period and from Amarna
and buried Tut there,

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:57.915 align:middle line:84%
covered in blue lotus
flowers, and left.

00:48:57.915 --> 00:49:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And then the Amun priesthood
marched around and took over

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:03.340 align:middle line:84%
again, and it wasn't even
royal lineage anymore,

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Horemheb, Smenkhkare.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And in those times, they had
to follow the matrilineal line.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So the next pharaoh
always had to marry

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.830 align:middle line:84%
the daughter of the
pharaoh before them.

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:14.480 align:middle line:90%
So Meritaten--

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Meritaten, yes.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER:
--married Smenkhkare,

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and then the army general
took over and the vizier.

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And then it was all
just totally corrupt.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And so even now they say
this is the tomb of Horemheb.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:24.630 align:middle line:90%
Horemheb stole that tomb.

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.879 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it sounds
like it really descended then

00:49:26.879 --> 00:49:27.970 align:middle line:90%
into the dark age.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Oh, you bet.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There was an attempt
in the 18th Dynasty to bring

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:35.110 align:middle line:84%
back not just the
matriarchy, but do away with

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.510 align:middle line:84%
the corruption, the petty gods
and corruption that were going

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:39.724 align:middle line:90%
on at the time.

00:49:39.724 --> 00:49:40.765 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:49:40.765 --> 00:49:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And the Amun priesthood
ended up taking over again,

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.070 align:middle line:90%
and we are in the Amun period.

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:45.695 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:49:45.695 --> 00:49:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And so
when people say Amen,

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't, because
that's the same thing.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:53.730 align:middle line:84%
We are still indoctrinated
in this idea.

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of Catholicism,
even Jesus sitting

00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:59.400 align:middle line:84%
on the lap of Mary
and all of that,

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:03.390 align:middle line:84%
that's Isis and Osiris and
Hathor-- sorry, and Horus.

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:06.450 align:middle line:90%
And we've copied a lot of this.

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that you have to
sell your soul for salvation

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and pay the priests and all that
and that you're disempowered,

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:14.594 align:middle line:90%
they took over again.

00:50:14.594 --> 00:50:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And then people say, oh, they
finally got rid of Akhenaten

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:18.750 align:middle line:84%
and went back to the
way it should be.

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Propaganda.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:21.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's worked.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's never
made sense to me, never,

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:23.870 align:middle line:90%
not for a moment.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.070 align:middle line:90%
It feels wrong in my bones.

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.111 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: That's right.

00:50:26.111 --> 00:50:27.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's the senses.

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:30.324 align:middle line:84%
So if we take you
from 360 senses to 5

00:50:30.324 --> 00:50:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and we repeat, repeat,
repeat, repeat, and this book

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and that book and
all the books say it,

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.724 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
believe it, right?

00:50:35.724 --> 00:50:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But not if you're a reincarnate
of a high-level initiate.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.600 align:middle line:90%
You just can't believe it.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And I say we have
cosmic appointments

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:43.786 align:middle line:90%
to find each other.

00:50:43.786 --> 00:50:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:45.940 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what's happening now.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for finishing
it off on that note.

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.570 align:middle line:84%
We know what we've
gone through since then

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and what we're finding
our way back to.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And part of what's expressing
itself is incredible pyramid

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.280 align:middle line:84%
technology around the
planet, but probably

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.380 align:middle line:84%
none more spectacular than
what you have experienced

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.160 align:middle line:84%
with Valery in-- it's
Siberia, isn't it?

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Tunguska-- is it in Siberia?

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.235 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the new pyramid.

00:51:10.235 --> 00:51:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: OK.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, even Siberia--
it's supposed

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to be the armpit of the
planet and all that--

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and we don't realize
what's going on in Russia.

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Lots.

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Lots.

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
functional new pyramid

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.130 align:middle line:84%
that has been complete in
the last few months, two

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:27.440 align:middle line:84%
months maybe, with
a crystal capstone

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and with casing
stones, and it was

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.920 align:middle line:84%
built according to the
original technology.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.080 align:middle line:90%


00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.429 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the construction
is hidden within.

00:51:37.429 --> 00:51:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at the
solid parts of the pyramid,

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.380 align:middle line:90%
you don't know what's inside.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And so what I know
from what he's shown me

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:49.240 align:middle line:84%
is that the pyramid started
with an eight-sided structure.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.344 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A bagwa.

00:51:50.344 --> 00:51:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yes.

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a template
for four-inch spirals

00:51:55.590 --> 00:52:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that look like the galaxy that
are made out of crushed quartz

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:84%
polymer, one white, one
black, one white, one black.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they've got
a 11, 12-foot-- you

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:10.860 align:middle line:84%
can see these pictures
on my website-- crystal,

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:14.207 align:middle line:84%
which is a channeling crystal,
an Isis crystal with three,

00:52:14.207 --> 00:52:16.850 align:middle line:84%
seven, three, seven
sides all the way around.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And at the base, there's
an inverted pyramid,

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.520 align:middle line:90%
but it's only slightly inverted.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.820 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is when the
stones-- if there was an Earth

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.290 align:middle line:10%
disturbance, the
stones would start

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.250 align:middle line:10%
to shake themselves tighter.

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:32.700 align:middle line:10%
And so they poured those stones,
according to Joseph Davidovits.

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.430 align:middle line:10%
Excuse me.

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.110 align:middle line:10%
Pardon.

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:39.290 align:middle line:84%
So they crushed quartz, they
mixed it with a polymer,

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:41.090 align:middle line:84%
they put it into
frames, and then

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.880 align:middle line:84%
they rang them while they were
curing with nine-foot tuning

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.200 align:middle line:90%
forks.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.860 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I can't even fathom
what it must feel like to be

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:51.976 align:middle line:90%
inside there.

00:52:51.976 --> 00:52:52.850 align:middle line:90%
You've been in there.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:54.391 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well,
not in the pyramid,

00:52:54.391 --> 00:52:56.939 align:middle line:84%
but they use the same
technology in this crystal spa--

00:52:56.939 --> 00:52:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, yes.

00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:58.231 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:52:58.231 --> 00:53:00.438 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: --and they put
the spirals in the walls--

00:53:00.438 --> 00:53:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: --and much,
much more than that.

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I stepped
into this building,

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was standing
in the Great Pyramid.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:10.620 align:middle line:84%
They've replicated all
the sound resonance.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So in this pyramid, there's
three chambers, one red,

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.800 align:middle line:90%
one white, one black.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And the red one is the
chamber of oracles.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a fountain inside
it where the water comes up

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.519 align:middle line:90%
and an 108-kilo crystal ball--

00:53:24.519 --> 00:53:25.435 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:27.921 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: --that
spins on the water.

00:53:27.921 --> 00:53:30.170 align:middle line:84%
There's another chamber that
has this huge bell that's

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:31.800 align:middle line:90%
like eight feet tall.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And so everything's about
resonance, and it's incredible.

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And inside where there would
be what you would think

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.730 align:middle line:84%
was blank is pyramid,
inverted pyramid, pyramid,

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:44.350 align:middle line:90%
inverted pyramid.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all built
into the structure.

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And the spiral's almost like
a labyrinth, but it isn't.

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.790 align:middle line:84%
It's replicating the
arms of the galaxy.

00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this
special energy comes from.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.230 align:middle line:84%
So then they made
another polymer,

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and they actually poured
the casing stones.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can see the
pyramid from miles away,

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:07.745 align:middle line:84%
and they put a quartz
crystal capstone on it.

00:54:07.745 --> 00:54:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And so people are having
spontaneous healings.

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:14.010 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you what I think
the most significant part is

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:17.415 align:middle line:84%
is the people who funded the
$5 million for the pyramid

00:54:17.415 --> 00:54:19.930 align:middle line:90%
are a produce company.

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted a
place-- they were looking

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:24.230 align:middle line:84%
for a warehouse that was going
to energize the food before it

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.740 align:middle line:90%
went on the trucks.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That sounds kind of
like John Burke and charging

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.670 align:middle line:90%
seeds and all that.

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: And to
feed the people.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But never mind GMO
foods-- and they've

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:33.450 align:middle line:84%
got a strict policy,
no GMO anywhere,

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying
to help the people.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And the spa is actually a
club that politicians can join

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and Putin is part
of, and they're

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:47.144 align:middle line:84%
wanting to heal the politicians,
open them to true spirituality.

00:54:47.144 --> 00:54:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Higher
conscious, yeah.

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: They're all
talking about UFO disclosure,

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and Valery himself is one of
the supreme something council

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.092 align:middle line:84%
of the UFO advisers
to the government.

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you've got to
wonder where this technology

00:54:58.550 --> 00:54:59.109 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.650 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well, and people are
educated, and they're peaceful.

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back from
Russia, people were saying,

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:05.360 align:middle line:84%
oh, the KGB's just
hanging around the corner.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:05.960 align:middle line:90%
You didn't see them.

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they're all
corrupt over there.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, you haven't even been.

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.670 align:middle line:90%
You haven't seen it.

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
fantastic and gorgeous,

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.000 align:middle line:90%
and it just goes on and on.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the kind of
thing that they're doing.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I want to go there.

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure everybody
listening wants to go there.

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.804 align:middle line:84%
This is just amazing,
and I've been listening

00:55:21.804 --> 00:55:25.021 align:middle line:84%
to it-- listening about its
progress for quite a long time

00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:25.520 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.895 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
a minute left.

00:55:26.895 --> 00:55:29.085 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you, your
new series that you're

00:55:29.085 --> 00:55:30.710 align:middle line:84%
going to be doing,
your new documentary

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:32.780 align:middle line:84%
series on the new
Atlantis, just give us

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.890 align:middle line:90%
the elevator pitch on it.

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> BOULTER: Well,
it's nine pyramids.

00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So the center pyramid
has been built.

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:41.570 align:middle line:10%
There is concentric
circles of four pyramids

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:42.780 align:middle line:10%
and four outside of that.

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:47.302 align:middle line:10%
And what it is is a new
technology, new everything,

00:55:47.302 --> 00:55:49.510 align:middle line:10%
education-- alternative
education, alternative media,

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:51.420 align:middle line:10%
alternative everything,
going into this place.

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.295 align:middle line:90%
It will have a hotel.

00:55:52.295 --> 00:55:53.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a training center.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is the philosophy
of why it's there.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.080 align:middle line:90%
They've got bee keeping.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.265 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
the salvation--

00:55:58.265 --> 00:55:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Bee
keeping, that's huge.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Siberia's big.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:00.618 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Yeah.

00:56:00.618 --> 00:56:02.770 align:middle line:84%
It's salvation of
everything that's wrong.

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And they're not gonna do it.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.530 align:middle line:90%
They're already doing it.

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is so exciting.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Really, again, we have to get
over our Cold-War-era mentality

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:14.200 align:middle line:84%
in the West about what's
going on in Russia.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.400 align:middle line:84%
They really have made, over
the last several decades, made

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:21.230 align:middle line:84%
some of the most profound
leaps scientifically and

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:22.650 align:middle line:90%
technology-wise.

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:27.032 align:middle line:84%
So now they're doing it, and
when will we all be invited in?

00:56:27.032 --> 00:56:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> BOULTER: Talk to me later.

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.031 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:56:29.031 --> 00:56:29.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.580 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.583 align:middle line:90%
