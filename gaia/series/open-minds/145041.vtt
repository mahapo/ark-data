00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Gaia's own Jay Weidner

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:10%
is with us to talk about his
new series coming out titled

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:10%
"Hollywood Decoded."

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll talk about the
power of film to program

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and inform society, and
a few of his favorites.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to get into
some pretty juicy, fun, wacky,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:10%
and also very
intense content here.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:10%
So first of all, I
wanted to find out--

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:10%
just tell us a little
bit about Jay and Jay,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:10%
the Jay and Jay show.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.564 align:middle line:84%
Because I think Jay has
already come out on Open Minds.

00:00:55.564 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Jay Dyer has already--

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.854 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Jay Dyer and
Jay Weidner are now on a show

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:84%
together, which should
be quite interesting.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.350 align:middle line:84%
He's more a professorial
type, and I'm

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
more of a glib kind
of person, so I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:84%
think it's going to be
an interesting dynamic.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:84%
We both have pretty close
views on what movies are

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and what symbols are, and
why they're so important.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
The juxtaposition of symbol into
film, and what film really is,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and why it's so important, and
why we love movies so much.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of us love
movies, really.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And so both of you are-- that
is the-- it's kind of obvious,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood Decoded.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.916 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us about the genre
film and kind of the time frame

00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:33.290 align:middle line:84%
over which these
movies were made

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.248 align:middle line:84%
and such, so we kind of
get an overview of what

00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:90%
the show is going to look like.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, the movies
take place probably from those--

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I think the earliest one
would probably "2001."

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
That was '68 So they're
mostly after '68.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that in 1968,
there was a break

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in Hollywood and the
way that they did films.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Up until '68, around that
time period, you know,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
it was "My Fair Lady,"
"Doctor Zhivago."

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:90%
These were the big films.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
There were these big, epic
films that didn't really

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:90%
have much heart.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:90%
They were just big.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't intellectually
challenging or socially

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
or culturally
challenging either.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think starting
in '68, '69,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood had a rebellion as
the boomers began coming in,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and then the
mid-boomers-- like Kubrick

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:84%
was in between the silent
generation and the boomers,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:90%
and he was a revolutionary.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And these movies
became more realistic.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Violence became more realistic,
sex became more realistic.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything became more
real, and a lot of people

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
were shocked by movies
like "Bonnie and Clyde"

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and "The Godfather," and
all these movies that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:90%
started after '68.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think it was a
golden age of filmmaking,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:90%
and I just loved--

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
all movies of the
'70s, I just loved.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the late '60s,
and even into the '80s

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
until Hollywood realized
that this rebellion

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:90%
had to be stopped.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And that was about
'82 when they realized

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:84%
the rebellion of the
Hollywood boomer directors

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:90%
had to be stopped.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And you could argue that
Stanley Kubrick's "2001" is

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:90%
the father of all these things.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if you talk to these
directors like Scorsese,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Spielberg, all these
people, Brian De Palma, that

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:84%
made all these great
films, they will tell you

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
that going to see
the movie "2001"

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:84%
was a super liberating
experience, because here

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
was finally a film that was
not using standard narrative

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.185 align:middle line:90%
devices to tell its story.

00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
It was using abstract
devices, abstract ideas.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, became
the major influence

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:84%
for all the cinema
until essentially '82,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.589 align:middle line:84%
'83 when I believe the
CIA took over Hollywood.

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of
evidence for that.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting you say
that, because what you were

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
speaking about before, I mean, I
wouldn't say they lacked heart.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I would say they were
emotional in nature.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
When we think back to the
movies of the '30s, '40s,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.556 align:middle line:84%
'50s, and '60s, it almost had
some kind of either family

00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
drama, even if you got into
some of the really good stuff

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
like James Dean's movies that
had a lot of deep emotion

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:90%
and heart and drama to them.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
But it was all
emotionally based.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And what you're talking about,
it's almost as though we took--

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.881 align:middle line:84%
we moved away from emotions
into the intellect.

00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, we did.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think "2001" gave
everybody permission

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.240 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of great
films came out of that,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:90%
and are still coming out of it.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, this
whole thing is '68

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
is also the time of
the Chicago riots,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
the Vietnam War, the moratorium
against the war in Vietnam.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:90%
All this stuff.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Feminism.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Feminism, environmentalism
was rising up.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
We were facing
racism again that we

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
kind of pushed under
the carpet, but now we

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:90%
were facing it again.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And are again.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.296 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: And we are again.

00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Because we're now--

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.123 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my God.

00:05:01.123 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a fabulous
movie that just came out

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.747 align:middle line:84%
that I think I'm trying to
talk you and Jay into doing,

00:05:05.747 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:90%
which is called "Get Out."

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Oh, I'm
going to go see it.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.123 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:05:08.123 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanism and
racism all at one time,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:84%
because it's just calling it
what it is, a dark comedy.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.574 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: You're seeing
a lot of the return

00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
to those same kind
of values that we had

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
in the late '60s coming
out right now again.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're living in very
revolutionary times,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:84%
so you're going to see very
revolutionary movies, I think.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.713 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That make sense.

00:05:24.713 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as Robert Phoenix
says, and has said repeatedly

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.840 align:middle line:84%
in my interviews with him,
we're under the same basically

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:84%
astrological influence
that we were then.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're starting to
see things happening

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:90%
that are very interesting.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And you know, like
"Westworld" on HBO

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:90%
was a very interesting show.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So I think that movies
really did transform right

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
around that time
period, and they've

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.066 align:middle line:90%
been transforming ever since.

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
movies that we're

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about today,
like "Chinatown" and "Twin

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Peaks" and David Lynch's
films especially,

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
were the first to really examine
the dark underbelly of America.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think, you
know, we started

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:84%
in the '50s with
film noir, which

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
was the beginning of
Hollywood's examination

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:90%
of the dark underbelly.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But then we kind of lost it,
and we went kind of frivolous

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s until it came back
in the late '60s and the '70s

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:84%
with kind of a fearless
examination of our life,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:90%
what we are as Americans.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we just had
also all these assassinations

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:90%
that had occurred at that time.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, Martin Luther
King, Kennedy, year 1968.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:90%
We were protesting the war.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.850 align:middle line:84%
We were having to wake up
to the hard facts of life

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And the establishment is telling
us that Lee Harvey Oswald did

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:84%
it, and it was pretty
obvious that he didn't.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And Sirhan Sirhan did it,
when it was clearly obvious

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that he could not have fired
the kill shot, because it came

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
from one inch behind
Bobby Kennedy's head,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.825 align:middle line:90%
according to the coroner.

00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was five
feet in front of him

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
with a .22, which really would
be pretty hard to kill someone

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's
what was going on,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and it was a revelation that
our parents did not share in.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.336 align:middle line:84%
And so they hated
our movies and quit

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:84%
going to the movies for
the most part at that time.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they were still
in the emotional generation

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:84%
that enjoyed the love story
that they were raised on.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.681 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
watching "Taxi Driver,"

00:07:17.681 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and like you say, "Godfather"
one, "Godfather II."

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, these films
that were incredibly

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
challenging and violent
for their generation.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They were.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We were young
and could embrace it.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And again, like, "Taxi
Driver" is a great film

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
at challenging the dark
underbelly of America

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.387 align:middle line:84%
and the prostitution rings
with underage children,

00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:90%
and the whole thing.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And people didn't want to even
think that these things were

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:90%
possible at the time.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And here they were,
being exposed in cinema.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you take
Roman Polanski's film

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:84%
"Chinatown," which I now think
is the greatest film ever made.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.715 align:middle line:84%
Past "Vertigo" and
"Citizen Kane" and "2001."

00:07:55.715 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:84%
On my recent viewing
for Hollywood Decoded,

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I was blown away by the maturity
and the view of corruption,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
both within the family structure
and also the larger society,

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.132 align:middle line:90%
how--

00:08:08.132 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Institutional
corruption.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: John Huston
is destroying California

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.202 align:middle line:84%
so that he can own
the water supply.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is all true stories.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are all things
that have come to pass now.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.456 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:90%
They're all true.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to drill down

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.063 align:middle line:84%
into each of these
movies in a minute,

00:08:22.063 --> 00:08:24.525 align:middle line:84%
but can we back up for a
little bit with little Jay?

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you were a
little kid-- now you

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:84%
don't have all of these
heady, intellectual films.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.149 align:middle line:84%
Did you like movies
as a little kid?

00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:32.315 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well, it's funny.

00:08:32.315 --> 00:08:36.147 align:middle line:84%
I liked some movies,
but I was a--

00:08:36.147 --> 00:08:39.379 align:middle line:84%
I'd always thought that cinema
was kind of a bastard art,

00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:40.179 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:84%
And I was very much into art,
and literature, and opera,

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.780 align:middle line:90%
and theater, and painting.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.094 align:middle line:84%
And I could speak for
hours about all of them.

00:08:50.094 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:90%
But I always thought--

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I was suspicious of
cinema, because it just

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:90%
seemed like a bastard art.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to
see "2001," and I

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:84%
realized when I walked out
the door that you really

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:84%
could create art with
cinema, and it was possible.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:90%
And then I got interested in it.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And now I realize that,
yes, it's a bastard art,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:90%
but it bastardized the best.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it
took music from opera,

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
it took its music from opera,
it took its acting from theater,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
it took its storytelling
from literature,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
it took its lighting and
qualities from theater.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:90%
Staging, costumes.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:90%
That all came from theater.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't theater.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.420 align:middle line:90%
It was something different.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
what movies were

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
was the culmination of all the
great Western art forms put

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
together so that a really good
movie looked like you were

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:84%
looking at a classical
painting or you

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
were watching a great theater
from the late 1900s when

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
they had the great theaters
in New York and Germany.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:90%
And the music.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
The closest thing
to classical music

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
that is being written
today is movie music.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that it
is, in fact, the art

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
form of the 20th century and
the 21st century, and going on.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And movies are just going to
get more and more interesting

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
as we get more and more
techniques perfected

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
bring storytelling

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.146 align:middle line:90%
to even more complex levels.

00:10:17.146 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and as we
open up our understanding

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge of
alternate realities, which

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:84%
is being very heavily portrayed,
alternate realities, and I

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.810 align:middle line:84%
mentioned earlier,
transhumanism,

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
the meeting of different realms
and star systems and all this,

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:84%
as our imagination
expands, it will expand.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I have to say one
thing though too.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Having been raised
in that same era,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I was always peeking
over my parents' shoulder

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:90%
at the drive-in.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see all
the love stories.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a female, I loved
all of this, all of these.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I liked the really intense
ones like "A Man And a Woman,"

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Things where you had
drama going on and loss

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and exploring the emotional
realm of my own young being.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.354 align:middle line:84%
And I think that might be
maybe a little more classically

00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:84%
feminine in some ways,
although a lot of girls

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.045 align:middle line:90%
are into sci-fi as well.

00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
We were naturally
rooted in that,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.409 align:middle line:90%
you might say, from the era.

00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I think it's normal.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We were still wearing
dresses to school at that time.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:90%
But I still think it's normal.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Women are more touchy feely,
and men are more idea-oriented.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.389 align:middle line:90%
I think that men--

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I think that the reason if
you go to see a horror film,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:84%
80% of the audience is
men, is because it's

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:90%
like doing high-risk sports.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Can this movie really
scare me to death?

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Am I man enough to put
up with this, right?

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of horror films

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.192 align:middle line:84%
are men kind of
self-initiating, right?

00:11:41.192 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're there and
you're watching this thing

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:90%
and go, I want to turn away.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to watch
what I'm watching.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Yet I cannot turn away.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I cannot turn away, but
I must turn away, right?

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And you get that dichotomy
going in a good horror film.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.865 align:middle line:84%
Every male that likes a horror
film likes it for that reason.

00:11:58.865 --> 00:11:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, sure.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, do you see any
representations right now,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.948 align:middle line:84%
You kind of have to do this
off the top of your head,

00:12:05.948 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's not in what
we're here to discuss.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But an example where
higher principles and love

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
are coming back together
with the intellect

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and creating these new
hybrid types of creatures

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:90%
in filmgoing.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I wish there
was a film like that.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:90%
It sounds great.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.721 align:middle line:90%
Will you write it for me?

00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
I'm always intrigued

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:90%
with that sort of thing.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I did
like the movie "Her."

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I did see it.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.291 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I thought that
was an interesting film

00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:84%
about transhumanism and love,
and where we're probably

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.456 align:middle line:90%
going if we're not careful.

00:12:34.456 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
interesting, because looking

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:84%
at it from the
man's point of view,

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
he just wanted to be told
what he wanted to hear.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.165 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
women had become.

00:12:43.165 --> 00:12:44.498 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's exactly right.

00:12:44.498 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't
an actual other force

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
that you could say can either
oppose or collaborate with.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted everything
handed to him the way

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:90%
he wanted it handed it to him.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.108 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: All men like that.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:90%
That's what all men want.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
that the world is

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.405 align:middle line:84%
kind of rapidly going that way
in terms of its dysfunction.

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think movies have
allowed to blame for that.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I think they've set up this
woman that you cannot really

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:90%
ever find.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:90%
How she's so beautiful--

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like "Her."

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Like what's her name?

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just no
body to deal with.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Scarlett
Johansson, right.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.865 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
every man would

00:13:15.865 --> 00:13:18.134 align:middle line:84%
love to have Scarlett
Johansson, but guess what, guys?

00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to get her.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just not going to happen.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.225 align:middle line:84%
Just like you're
not going to get--

00:13:23.225 --> 00:13:25.414 align:middle line:84%
I forget the guy-- the
guy who plays "Thor."

00:13:25.414 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Who's the actor
that plays "Thor?"

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:90%
Hemsworth.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, Hems--

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.033 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chris Hemsworth.

00:13:30.033 --> 00:13:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: 99% of
the women are never

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:84%
going to get a guy
that looks like him.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So all of our ideals have been
kind of destroyed by movies.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hollywood
has really skewed

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:90%
what we accept as reality.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that part
has been damaging,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.275 align:middle line:84%
because the brain doesn't
know fact from fiction.

00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
It only knows its
own experience.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It's really the
dark side of Hollywood,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:90%
and it has hurt us.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
great ideal that's

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.360 align:middle line:84%
not going to be
able to be achieved.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So you have to kind of lower
your standards in order

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.940 align:middle line:90%
to be with a human being.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:90%
And the men don't--

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle line:84%
especially with the
notion of virtual reality

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
experiences coming out,
why would any teenage guy

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
choose a real girl that he
gets in arguments with now?

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.570 align:middle line:90%
That really worries me.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It worries me too.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a little tricky.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But we just have to
say it's another phase

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:90%
of human evolution.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So because these films
that you just talked about

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:84%
are of this kind of
intellectual, subversive range,

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.670 align:middle line:84%
are you going to go all the
way up through modern times

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:84%
now and start catching
up with what's

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:84%
happening now,
even after you say

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:90%
there was a blank after '82?

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happened is
because of the technology

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:84%
has come down to where now I've
got a camera for $3,000 that

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:84%
eight years ago would have
been $70,000, $80,000.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
quality on the $3,000

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:84%
is actually better
than that quality.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And everything is being
reduced down in price.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:84%
A guy like me or somebody could
make a film, a low-budget film,

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and still have it
look really good.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's where
the interesting stuff is coming

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:90%
out, is from the independents.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't think the studios--

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.569 align:middle line:84%
although the studios have
made interesting films

00:15:06.569 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:84%
like "Get Out" of
here is interesting

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and "Doctor Strange"
was very interesting.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And there are good
films coming out.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But the studio still
has constraints,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:84%
political constraints
mostly, and they're

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
afraid to go too
far out on a limb.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So they're, like,
going a little bit out.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Like, I just watched in the
last James Bond movie recently,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:90%
"Spectre."

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Dang, it started out,
and the first half, I

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.303 align:middle line:84%
thought I was watching
one of the best films

00:15:33.303 --> 00:15:36.030 align:middle line:84%
ever, because there's
a secret society that

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
was represented by an octopus,
which was very interesting.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was taking over
everything in the world.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And Bond had to stop it.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
last 40 minutes

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:84%
is just hitting
and shooting and--

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pretty much.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:90%
I felt the same as you did.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, I
was, like, really

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:90%
disappointed in the ending.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But man, I thought for
the first 40 minutes,

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
we were going to have the
greatest movie ever made.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, there you go.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And also we're talking-- that
answers my question myself

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
from a little bit ago My
favorite bond film ever

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:84%
was the remake of
"Casino Royale."

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It was the best.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.975 align:middle line:84%
It was by far the
best Bond film.

00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it had passion,

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.640 align:middle line:84%
it had genuine passion and
love at the heart of it,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and then all the complexities
of life surrounding it,

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.932 align:middle line:90%
and politics and secrets.

00:16:12.932 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well it was.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that that was a
good film, in my point of view,

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:84%
is I never really liked Bond,
because he's a psychopath.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I mean, he kills.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.846 align:middle line:90%
He's got a license to kill.

00:16:22.846 --> 00:16:23.645 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:23.645 --> 00:16:24.805 align:middle line:90%
Who has a license to kill?

00:16:24.805 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, only a psychopath would
want to have a license to kill.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And without
even raising his pulse.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't raise his pulse.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And he has sex with
any woman he wants.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't care about them.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't
raise his pulse either.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Doesn't
raise his pulse either.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:90%
He's just this flatline guy.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And I never really
cared for him.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But then when Daniel Craig
came in, I said, whoa.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And he fell in love.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fell in love and
it was all on the table.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It was great.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the ending
was just, whoa.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.443 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It was a great movie.

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:51.639 align:middle line:90%
It was the best Bond movie ever.

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so too.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Daniel
Craig really kicked off

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:90%
the series great with that.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He did.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, symbolism.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
When's the first time
you started really

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.527 align:middle line:90%
noticing symbolism in films?

00:16:58.527 --> 00:17:00.193 align:middle line:84%
Because you guys are
going to talk a lot

00:17:00.193 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:90%
about symbolism in your series.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.319 align:middle line:84%
I guess it would be "2001"
with the black monolith.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:07.705 align:middle line:84%
You know, vexed for
years of what that really

00:17:07.705 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to mean.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:84%
And I finally am actually the
first one to figure it out.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the shape of
the Cinerama movie screen

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
for which the movie
was projected on.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's an inside
joke by Kubrick,

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
that the thing that reveals
the truth about human genesis

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and evolution is
the movie screen.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:90%
It was a very--

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:84%
very inside joke
by Stanley Kubrick.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.860 align:middle line:90%
And also it's black.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And we know from
alchemy that everything

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:84%
comes from the nigredo, from
the black stone, all right?

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beginning of
all alchemical transformations.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
The very first thing
you see in the movie

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:84%
is the black screen, which
is really the monolith, OK?

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:90%
And then the movie starts.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the apes
are transformed

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
by this mysterious
black monolith, which

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:84%
seems to inject IQ, sort of like
the monkey learning channel.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And then later, it transforms
the astronaut Bowman

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:90%
into the Star Child.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's when he passes
through the monolith

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that he is transmuted
into the Star Child.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And so that got me
thinking about symbols.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that why
symbols are so important,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I like to say that if a picture
is worth a thousand words,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.480 align:middle line:84%
a symbol is worth a
thousand pictures.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
symbols are rooted deep in us.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:90%
So what is a symbol?

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And let's take HAL,
the computer in "2001."

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a big red eye, right?

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:90%
An ominous-looking red eye.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it, you get
this ominous kind of feeling.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:46.875 align:middle line:90%
Well, why?

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:50.905 align:middle line:84%
Why does a symbol of HAL
create an ominous feeling

00:18:50.905 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:90%
in the gut of the viewer?

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because for thousands
and thousands of years,

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:84%
we hunted with spears out
in the middle of the woods,

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and the last thing
you wanted to see

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:84%
was a big red eye staring at
you through the underbrush,

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:84%
because it usually meant you
had about two seconds to live,

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:90%
And so that's in us.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:90%
It's built into our DNA.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
So symbols are built
into the DNA itself.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually about life and
death, and struggle, and birth,

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and separation, and
coming back together,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and all of these things
are what it's about.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when you inject the
right symbol at the right place,

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
it hits the viewer in a
way that you can't really

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:90%
get something else to work.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And so when somebody
knows how to use symbols,

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:84%
then the film has a tapestry
of a much deeper meaning.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you love Kubrick.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I do.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you love Kubrick--
he's one of your favorites.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And you've done some work
very, very closely-- not just

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:84%
paralleling, but speaking of his
work and referring to his work

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:90%
very specifically.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, I
have two shows on Gaia.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Kubrick's Odyssey I and II.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And-- well, I was going to
go one direction with it,

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about why
Kubrick in particular--

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:90%
and also his use of symbolism.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But also, you say he was making
this film "A Space Odyssey"

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:90%
as R&D for the Apollo fakery.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.547 align:middle line:84%
So because that's your
area of expertise,

00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:15.880 align:middle line:84%
let's go ahead and launch
into that a bit for people who

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.010 align:middle line:90%
don't--

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Why not?

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: OK.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So in 1964, in early 1964,
the Department of Information,

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:84%
the US government, for
reasons unexplained,

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:32.320 align:middle line:84%
decided that to create dossiers
on the top five Hollywood

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:90%
directors.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.562 align:middle line:84%
It was Billy Wilder,
Sydney Pollack--

00:20:37.562 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember all of them.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.170 align:middle line:84%
They were big in the
'50s and early '60s.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And they added one director who
had not really had a big hit,

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and he was young, and his
name was Stanley Kubrick.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
odd that they would

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:90%
put this guy on this list.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Why are were looking for him
to begin with is another story.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Another aside,
before I go on, is

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that while he was making "Dr.
Strangelove" in 1962, '63,

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.160 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force refused to let
him see the plans for the B-52

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:90%
bomber.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So Kubrick bought a bunch
of aviation weekly magazines

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and put the whole
inside of the B-52

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.240 align:middle line:84%
together through photographs
that he had seen.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the people in
the Pentagon called up Kubrick,

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we want to come
on your set and see your B-52,

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:84%
see if you broke any
national security secrets.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And Kubrick's, like,
completely, you know, sweating

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, really afraid,
because he doesn't really

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:90%
like the US government anyway.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why he's
shooting in England.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And they land,
and they come out,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and they see the set for the
B-52, and they say it's exact.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:90%
It's exact.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And they go back and
they file a report.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:90%
OK, I believe--

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now he's
a person of interest.

00:21:46.075 --> 00:21:46.967 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Mm-hmm.

00:21:46.967 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that--
oh, and they also

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
said that the flying
B-52 in "Dr. Strangelove"

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:84%
was the best flying effect
ever, and they could not

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:84%
believe it was done with a
model in a process called

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.845 align:middle line:90%
front screen projection.

00:21:57.845 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
That's very important
to remember that.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
this Department

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:84%
of Information, creating
a list of directors,

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and the Air Force coming
to see Stanley Kubrick

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.639 align:middle line:90%
is not a coincidence.

00:22:08.639 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
looking for someone

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:84%
who could direct the faking
of the Apollo moon landings.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying they
didn't go to the moon.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.289 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:22:17.289 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about those
theories in a moment,

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
because there are, like,
three different ones.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: OK.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So they just did
it for insurance.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And another thing I have to
say is out of all these five

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:84%
directors that they
were collecting data on,

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:84%
the only director
who had actually

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
rooted in the technology
of cinema was Stanley.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:84%
The rest had all
come from theater.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.462 align:middle line:84%
And they had technicians
in cinema working for them.

00:22:42.462 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Stanley knew how
to run the camera.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.954 align:middle line:90%
He knew how to light.

00:22:44.954 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:84%
He knew how to do
everything on the set.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:90%
He didn't even need anybody.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:90%
He could do everything.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Frequently, he did, in
fact, when he was younger.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this was a guy
who knew the tools

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.010 align:middle line:84%
of filmmaking as opposed to
just how to direct an actor.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I think he got elected
to be the guy, through the "Dr.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Strangelove"
footage, and then he

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:84%
used "A Space Odyssey"
as R&D to figure out

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:90%
exactly how to do it.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And he also got a carte
blanche contract, which

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:84%
no filmmaker has ever gotten,
that he can make whatever

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:21.160 align:middle line:84%
films he wants for the rest
of his life, and no one can--

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
he has final edit
on all of them.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:90%
No one in history.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Not Orson Welles and Spielberg.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:84%
No one has ever had
a contract like that.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:36.895 align:middle line:84%
And thirdly, NASA gave Stanley
two $2 million lenses in 1972

00:23:36.895 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:84%
so that he could shoot "Barry
Lyndon," the candle scenes.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, now
why would that be?

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:40.885 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:23:40.885 --> 00:23:41.685 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:23:41.685 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:90%
$4 million in lenses for free?

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.714 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty
amazing deal there.

00:23:45.714 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, since we've
opened the can of worms,

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.144 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and explain why he
did that in your opinion.

00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I think
he did it for many reasons.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:57.600 align:middle line:84%
One, he wanted to rub
shoulders with the elite.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And the people at NASA, he
was really impressed with.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And Arthur C. Clarke knew them
all, and he was like, you know,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
a young man, and Arthur C.
Clarke was in his late 40s.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And here's the greatest science
fiction writer of all time,

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and Kubrick was like,
you know, probably

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
like a little kid a
little bit, right?

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think we know from his
movie, "The Shining," which

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:84%
was also about the
Apollo program,

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:84%
we know that he
came to regret it.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And he maybe even told
a friend who died,

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.580 align:middle line:84%
may have been killed
because of it.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be intimating
in the "The Shining."

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.491 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That he had made
the fake moon landing video.

00:24:30.491 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about why that would

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:90%
have been made to begin with.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Because
imagine you've never

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:90%
ever landed on the moon before.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.750 align:middle line:90%
With people.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:84%
What if that lander had clipped
a rock or a cliff or something?

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Coming in and started
tumbling and got destroyed.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:84%
The whole world would have sat
and watched two astronauts die

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.580 align:middle line:90%
in front of them for five days.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It really would have been the
most horrendous experience

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
the human race would have ever
collectively gone through.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.970 align:middle line:84%
They could not take
that chance, OK?

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:90%
So they faked it.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say they faked
going to the moon.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.490 align:middle line:90%
I said they faked--

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.864 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
a lot of people

00:25:10.864 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
misunderstand what
you've said on this.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I want to make that clear.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.162 align:middle line:90%
I did not say they faked--

00:25:15.162 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I think they've
gone to the moon many times.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, if you
go into the deep space program

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that everybody's
worked on here--

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly
if you to Deep Space.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --it would
appear not just humans,

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:24.945 align:middle line:90%
but other species in there too.

00:25:24.945 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I think that
they did that to hide--

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that in other words, they
said they spent $30 billion

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.934 align:middle line:90%
on the Apollo program.

00:25:30.934 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
That money went into the
Secret Space Program,

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and they only spent
maybe $100 million

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.077 align:middle line:84%
making the fake
landings and things.

00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And it really wouldn't be very
hard to make the fake landings.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what anybody says.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you think they
not only went to the moon once,

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:84%
but maybe more, but they had
to have this, you're saying,

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:84%
cover video so it could, on
a public relations level--

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --it could make us
comfortable with the notion we

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:90%
have this capability.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And you know--

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Without seeing,
you know, carnage.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.793 align:middle line:90%
Nixon was president.

00:25:58.793 --> 00:26:00.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not exactly
like he is the kind

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
of a guy that likes to tell
untruths every once in a while.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's not
that big a stretch.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.136 align:middle line:84%
I would have done it
if I was president.

00:26:07.136 --> 00:26:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I would have.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.635 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have wanted
to put the world

00:26:09.635 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:90%
through that possibility or not.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
there's other things.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.965 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell went to Bob
Masters, a friend of mine who

00:26:16.965 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:84%
was a master
hypnotherapist, in 1974,

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and asked him to hypnotize him,
because he could not remember

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.200 align:middle line:90%
what happened on the moon.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.732 align:middle line:84%
I also knew the psychiatrist
who debriefed the astronauts.

00:26:29.732 --> 00:26:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her what
the debriefings were

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:84%
like, and she said, Jay,
it's the strangest experience

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.330 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember any of them.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:90%
So they've all been mindwiped.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that Buzz
Aldrin was also mindwiped.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:10%
And I believe
"Clockwork Orange,"

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.380 align:middle line:10%
the Kubrick film that
followed "2001," is

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:10%
about how they mindwiped you.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
know, and they said,

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:84%
how are you going to stop
these guys from talking?

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And they said, oh.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.540 align:middle line:90%
We've got this little program.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And then he want, oh.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll make
a movie about that.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think that Kubrick
faked it to rub shoulders

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.770 align:middle line:84%
with the elite, but
also to guarantee

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
this contract that was
ironclad, that no one could

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:90%
screw with his films.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, nobody cared
about what "2001" was really

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:84%
going to be about,
because it was just an R&D

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:90%
program for the Apollo program.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.170 align:middle line:84%
He got to make any
film he wanted.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.269 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Plus he got
some fancy lenses.

00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Are there any other
points of evidence that

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:84%
suggest that he and NASA
were in bed together?

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: There is
the very odd fact

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that there are three films
that came out after "2001"

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and the Apollo
landings, which seemed

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:84%
to indicate that
somebody in Hollywood

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:84%
knows that Stanley Kubrick
was involved in it.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And those three films
would be "Being There"

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.272 align:middle line:90%
with Peter Sellers--

00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now relate
that, the two.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: OK.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So "Being There," Peter Sellers
was in two of Kubrick's films,

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:90%
two of his best films.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And he plays Chauncey the
Gardener in "Being There."

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's a scene, a
completely throwaway scene,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't make any
sense, where Chauncey

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
is walking around
Manhattan at Christmastime,

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:84%
looking at store windows like
Macy's and things and displays

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And the soundtrack is
playing the "2001" theme,

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:84%
the jazz theme by Deodato,
which is dah, dah, dah.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.410 align:middle line:90%
It's jazz, right?

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And right when that
theme-- dah, dah--

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:84%
the famous "2001"
scene starts up,

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Peter Sellers is looking
through a Macy's window

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.260 align:middle line:90%
at a toy setup of Apollo 11.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: All right?

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:90%
There's one.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.300 align:middle line:90%
Two is "Toy Story."

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Buzz Lightyear is
an astronaut toy,

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:84%
but he thinks he's
a real astronaut.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And all the other
toys make fun of him,

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.690 align:middle line:84%
because he thinks
he's real, right?

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:84%
He thinks he's a real
hero, went to space.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And one day, Buzz is
walking past a TV that's on

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and he sees an ad for
Buzz Lightyear as a toy,

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:90%
and he realizes he is a toy.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And this sad Randy
Newman music comes on,

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and he crawls up this banister,
and he looks out the window

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:90%
at the moon, and he's all sad.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he says,
I am an astronaut.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And he leaps to take off, and
he falls and crashes, right?

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the wallpaper
behind Buzz in this scene

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the
floor pattern that's

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:84%
under Danny in the famous
scene in "The Shining"

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:25.080 align:middle line:84%
where he reveals his Apollo
11 t-shirt or sweater.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Now what's
interesting about that

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
is that when Rodney Ascher, the
creator of "Room 237," which

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.142 align:middle line:84%
is a film about "The
Shining" where I'm partaking

00:29:35.142 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of other people
with theories about what

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
"The Shining" is
about, what he did

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:84%
his crowdfunding for that
movie, the very first person who

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:84%
put almost all the
money into "Room 237"

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.200 align:middle line:84%
was the guy who put all
the money into "Toy Story."

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Then the final
movie's a Bond movie,

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.880 align:middle line:84%
"Diamonds Are
Forever," in which he's

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.530 align:middle line:84%
at an Area 51-like facility,
trying to escape from people

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:90%
chasing him for some reason.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And he tumbles-- stumbles
into the moon launching set,

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.137 align:middle line:84%
and they're driving
around in the moon buggy,

00:30:08.137 --> 00:30:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and he runs through
the set, you know?

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.886 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's chasing him.

00:30:10.886 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, clearly,
they're telling you there too.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's three movies where
they're clearly telling you

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.827 align:middle line:84%
that they know that the
moon landing was faked,

00:30:21.827 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and two of them, they're
connecting it to Kubrick.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The film
"Chinatown," which,

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:84%
because I knew we were
getting ready for this

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and you liked it so much,
I re-watched recently.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And you start.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I watched it again recently
too for Hollywood Decoded.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that that
film, it could have slipped

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:84%
into cornball at any moment
with the Hollywood detective

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:90%
in the '30s, you know?

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Sam Spade and all that.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:90%
And it never did.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It always held its
own and its maturity.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And you got to wonder what
the screenwriter, Robert Towne

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:90%
was thinking.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Because he was trying to explain
the story of the history of Los

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.466 align:middle line:84%
Angeles and the
Water Wars, but he

00:31:02.466 --> 00:31:03.840 align:middle line:84%
was also trying
to tell the story

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
of the corruption of the
leadership of Los Angeles.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And to partner with
Roman Polanski and Jack

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:90%
Nicholson is a very odd thing.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very odd.

00:31:16.345 --> 00:31:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet he was involved
with John Huston, who's

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.512 align:middle line:84%
playing this part
that we're going

00:31:21.512 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:84%
to speak of in the
movie as real daughter

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.390 align:middle line:90%
in real life, Anjelica.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And Jack Nicholson is
dating Anjelica Huston

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.690 align:middle line:84%
at the same time as
"Chinatown" is being made.

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.274 align:middle line:84%
And there's a famous line in the
movie where John Huston looks

00:31:36.274 --> 00:31:38.314 align:middle line:84%
at Jack Nicholson and
says, (GRUFF VOICE) are you

00:31:38.314 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:90%
having sex with my daughter?

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.064 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it is interesting
considering the plot,

00:31:43.064 --> 00:31:44.730 align:middle line:84%
that that was going
on at the same time.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And the incest and
the pedophilia,

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:84%
the corruption that
they're really trying

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.300 align:middle line:90%
to expose in "Chinatown."

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had an uncle
who was an FBI agent.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Right before he died,
which was about '76,

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.830 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about movies.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
you're an FBI agent

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.490 align:middle line:90%
with 40 years of experience.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:06.420 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is a film that
would really show me, you know,

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.785 align:middle line:90%
what this world is really about?

00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:08.785 align:middle line:90%
And he said "Chinatown."

00:32:08.785 --> 00:32:10.650 align:middle line:90%
He said, watch it over and over.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.060 align:middle line:90%
It's revealing a lot of things.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, the monopoly
of certain power families

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and the corrupt
influence they have

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
over the land, and ultimately,
over the lives of people.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:27.690 align:middle line:84%
They'll go to any means to
essentially obscure an issue

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:31.860 align:middle line:84%
in the media, for example, just
like this Water Wars situation.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time
in the end, you're

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:35.922 align:middle line:90%
left with only one feeling.

00:32:35.922 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:84%
You can't win
against these people.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:90%
They win.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And the word Chinatown, you
could just change it out

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
with corruption, and it
would work perfectly.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Every time they say
Chinatown, they're

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:84%
saying this corrupt world
or this is all corrupt.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, remember,
it's Chinatown.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the police
guy says [INAUDIBLE]??

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.240 align:middle line:90%
It's Chinatown.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Remember,
it's Chinatown.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:56.410 align:middle line:90%
And you can--

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
nothing you can do.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Nothing
you can do about it.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was a moment in
the movie that really gave you

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the chills, and a different
one that gave me the chills.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.645 align:middle line:90%
And share yours first.

00:33:05.645 --> 00:33:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It's
near the end when

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Jack Nicholson is talking
to John Huston and he says,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:90%
you're an old man.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.079 align:middle line:90%
You've got tons of money.

00:33:13.079 --> 00:33:14.370 align:middle line:90%
You've got everything you want.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:15.774 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing this for?

00:33:15.774 --> 00:33:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And John Huston looks at
him and goes, (GRUFF VOICE)

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.950 align:middle line:90%
I want to own the future.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:21.876 align:middle line:84%
And that's how these
rich guys think.

00:33:21.876 --> 00:33:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, because I
think that's a motivation

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people can understand.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
We do all these shows
on conspiracy and power,

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:84%
about the power elite and the
hidden hand, and so forth.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes down to it,
it seems like that is always

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:90%
the one factor.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:84%
You have everything you can
have in the material world,

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:41.360 align:middle line:84%
but you're corrupted by a
dark influence of some kind.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And there is nothing
left but power, right?

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Power for power's sake.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of-- in their own
minds, domination and supremacy

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.950 align:middle line:90%
above everyone else.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: What I really like
about "Chinatown," which I also

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:84%
didn't notice until
this last time,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
is that Polanski's using
these amazing water

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.480 align:middle line:90%
motifs through the whole movie.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.056 align:middle line:84%
There's the pool with
the eyeglasses in it.

00:34:07.056 --> 00:34:09.139 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody's like,
can I make you a drink?

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody swirling
a glass, right?

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.719 align:middle line:84%
And he's taking this
kind of fluidity

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:20.179 align:middle line:84%
of a natural substance which
Los Angeles does not have any.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And Los Angeles is corrupting
the entire western United

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.658 align:middle line:84%
States, stealing
all of their water--

00:34:26.658 --> 00:34:27.949 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To quench its thirst.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:28.429 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:29.229 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:34:29.229 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:90%
For entertainment.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.080 align:middle line:84%
For the entertainment industry,
which was the only business

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.354 align:middle line:84%
really in Los Angeles outside
of agriculture at the time.

00:34:37.354 --> 00:34:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of
a waste that is.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and all the
other lakes around there

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.372 align:middle line:84%
that it's drained
dry, sucked dry.

00:34:44.372 --> 00:34:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Mono Lake is gone.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:45.989 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mono Lake.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: All those--

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Owens Lake
went first, you know?

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it is a fascinating
story, the corruption involved

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:90%
in the watering of Los Angeles.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.885 align:middle line:84%
So what's the line that
you found so chilling?

00:34:56.885 --> 00:34:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it
was in the end when

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.690 align:middle line:84%
it was revealed by Faye
Dunaway that her daughter was

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:90%
her sister.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And it is a violent scene.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Mother,
daughter, mother--

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.770 align:middle line:84%
"She's my daughter,
she's my sister.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.980 align:middle line:84%
She's my daughter,
she's my sister."

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Until finally, she looked at him
and said, don't you understand?

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And so he confronted John
Huston at another point.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And John Huston very
smugly, like a person

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:29.240 align:middle line:84%
who knows power and knows
he's beyond the law,

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:84%
beyond the reach
of anything, said--

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:36.290 align:middle line:84%
the line was, under the right
circumstances and at the right

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:90%
time, we can do anything.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, he
raped his daughter.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And so she raised her daughter
as her sister to the public.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.320 align:middle line:84%
But this theme came out
again in another movie

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:90%
that's on this list.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to--
because you've spent

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.900 align:middle line:84%
so much time in the
world of conspiracy

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and in the world of
symbolism, and looking

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.250 align:middle line:84%
into secret societies and
satanic cults, and so forth.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And Hollywood certainly
has reflected some of that.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.000 align:middle line:84%
They have their own society
and rituals around that.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.050 align:middle line:84%
The whole notion of
right there, on film,

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:19.191 align:middle line:84%
showing this man saying, we
can do anything under the--

00:36:19.191 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
if you give us the right
time and right circumstances,

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.990 align:middle line:90%
we can do anything as men.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the rape of
his daughter, it

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:31.240 align:middle line:84%
shows me this thing that is so
taboo and hidden in our culture

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that we don't like to speak
about that affects roughly one

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:38.510 align:middle line:84%
in four children, three, four,
five, depending on the sex,

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:90%
is right there.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:40.970 align:middle line:90%
He put it in the film.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:45.940 align:middle line:84%
What was this-- was this
to draw our attention to--

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.140 align:middle line:90%
why did he do this?

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Because I think it's
important because it's there

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and nobody wants
to talk about it.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And it is, in some ways, the
whole point of power politics

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:03.220 align:middle line:84%
is to have sex with
anyone that you want to.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that something
happens to men, especially men,

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.270 align:middle line:84%
they get older and they
have a lot of money.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And the wife isn't looking
as good as she used to look,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and they could buy
anything they want.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And why don't I just
do what I want to do?

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.712 align:middle line:84%
And I think once you make
that step, it's like--

00:37:21.712 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're over
onto the dark side,

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.129 align:middle line:84%
and then anything is
possible after that.

00:37:25.129 --> 00:37:27.169 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It's like an
alcoholic taking a drink.

00:37:27.169 --> 00:37:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Once you've done it,
you can't go back.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's look
at it in a larger sense,

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.801 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to go
into another movie that

00:37:32.801 --> 00:37:34.100 align:middle line:90%
also has that at the core.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And that is, there's an
innocence in children.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the
whole notion of these people

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:84%
in satanic groups
and so forth, they're

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.650 align:middle line:90%
only of the material world.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:48.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't have inherent
spiritual development.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't look to
the spiritual aspects

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:55.660 align:middle line:84%
of what life has to offer for
really any of their upliftment,

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.100 align:middle line:90%
joy, or expansion.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So once you're limited
to the material world,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.130 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me that when you
have been degraded far enough,

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:84%
the only thing you have
left to suck off of

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.047 align:middle line:84%
is literally the light
and innocence of children.

00:38:09.047 --> 00:38:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's exactly right.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And most of these
people do not even

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.857 align:middle line:84%
believe that there's a
spiritual world at all.

00:38:14.857 --> 00:38:15.656 align:middle line:90%
They don't care.

00:38:15.656 --> 00:38:17.140 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
even care about it.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.140 align:middle line:84%
They only care about
the material world.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.180 align:middle line:84%
In school, we're only
taught that there's just

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:21.985 align:middle line:90%
a material world.

00:38:21.985 --> 00:38:23.650 align:middle line:90%
We're not taught anything else.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can't really
blame these people

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:84%
for thinking that all
there is is material.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And so then they-- all they do
is go after material and power

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:31.660 align:middle line:90%
and money.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's another
thing, and it came out

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:84%
in another film I just
watched very, very recently.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is the notion
that there is evil.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I look at it this way.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.960 align:middle line:84%
You have higher realms-- you
have us here on this stage,

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and we can resonate
and choose our path.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.590 align:middle line:84%
We have higher realms that are
interfacing with Earth realm.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.290 align:middle line:84%
We have lower realms that
are resonating with it.

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And the lower realms
are material in nature,

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.066 align:middle line:84%
and they suck off of the
material and the life

00:39:00.066 --> 00:39:02.210 align:middle line:90%
force of our Earth realm.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And so in the film "Twin
Peaks," David Lynch

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.940 align:middle line:84%
managed to get all
of those themes in.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:15.140 align:middle line:84%
The underworld sucking on
these characters, incest

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:20.649 align:middle line:84%
once again, showing how
dark that world can be.

00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and talk
about "Twin Peaks,"

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and what you think
the value in it was.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: "Twin Peaks" is
the most revolutionary TV

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:30.710 align:middle line:90%
show of all time.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean that it's,
like, a great TV show.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.630 align:middle line:90%
It has flaws.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But the way that
it was presented,

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.259 align:middle line:84%
both the way the Pacific
Northwest was shown,

00:39:40.259 --> 00:39:42.050 align:middle line:84%
it was the beginning
of showing the Pacific

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Northwest in this kind of
eerie, spooky fashion that

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:45.950 align:middle line:90%
continued on.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.720 align:middle line:84%
"X-Files" and
"Northern Exposure,"

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of films that
came out after "Twin Peaks."

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's
called "Twin Peaks"

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:56.090 align:middle line:84%
is because what
Lynch is showing you

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:58.160 align:middle line:84%
over and over
throughout the series

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.680 align:middle line:84%
is that we live in
this fierce duality.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a fierce duality.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Laura Palmer, who's the
whole reason she gets killed

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.290 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of "Twin
Peaks," and the whole story

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:14.720 align:middle line:84%
is a fulcrum based on that
murder, she has two diaries.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Her cousin is a
doppelganger, which

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:19.070 align:middle line:90%
is a dead lookalike for her.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:22.385 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has a
double in the film.

00:40:22.385 --> 00:40:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
the good in the dark.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:90%
And Bob the villain.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, his name can be
spelled either way.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Bob can be spelled both ways.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So everything's a duality, and
he's playing these dualities

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:90%
off of each other.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's all quiet
and behind the scenes.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.785 align:middle line:84%
If you're not noticing
it, you won't see it.

00:40:42.785 --> 00:40:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But the way that
he lines shots up

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and the way that he puts
characters together,

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:52.560 align:middle line:84%
he's constantly telling you that
what you think this person is

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.230 align:middle line:90%
is not what this person is.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Laura is not the cheerleading
homecoming queen.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.250 align:middle line:84%
She's being run by criminals
in a prostitution ring

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.830 align:middle line:84%
across town and
across the border,

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:07.400 align:middle line:84%
interestingly, because there's
a border there in the town.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So everything is split between
Canada and the United States.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And Washington state also
is a bifurcated state

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:19.020 align:middle line:84%
where the mountains, you know,
leave the west half all green

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.875 align:middle line:90%
and the east half all dry.

00:41:20.875 --> 00:41:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So even the state of
Washington where it was filmed

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:90%
is a bifurcated state.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing is
this whole bifurcation.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:30.410 align:middle line:90%
And Lynch, Lynch is a genius.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's a subtle
genius, though.

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not a genius
overtly like Kubrick.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:37.280 align:middle line:90%
It's very subtle and dark.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a very dark genius
about the dark world

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.679 align:middle line:90%
that lays underneath.

00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it's
all colored differently.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.170 align:middle line:84%
You can tell it's a lower
realm of consciousness,

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:90%
a lower realm of spirituality.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And Cooper, who's the hero of
"Twin Peaks," he's doing yoga,

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:90%
he's meditating.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:84%
He's very nice to
everybody he meets.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:90%
He never has a bad word to say.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.430 align:middle line:84%
He's totally fascinated
by all the people

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.580 align:middle line:90%
that he's around, by the trees.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:84%
He's like this angelic force
through all these demons.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.334 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's a demon but him.

00:42:09.334 --> 00:42:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at the
end of the series,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.414 align:middle line:90%
he becomes a demon, which was--

00:42:12.414 --> 00:42:14.330 align:middle line:84%
they never carried it
on, but apparently, they

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.955 align:middle line:84%
are carrying it on,
because it's coming

00:42:15.955 --> 00:42:17.180 align:middle line:90%
on Showtime in a few weeks.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:17.740 align:middle line:90%
So we'll see.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.906 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was a lot
of symbolism in that film.

00:42:19.906 --> 00:42:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was something
else that was said.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.840 align:middle line:84%
It was another line
that kind of gave me

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.892 align:middle line:84%
the chillies in that
one in the movie.

00:42:25.892 --> 00:42:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But one of them, this whole
thing about the left arm,

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:90%
and the creepy little guy.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:29.890 align:middle line:90%
What did this mean?

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:32.150 align:middle line:90%
The left arm was numb, you know?

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: The left-hand
path, which was the dark path.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And Lynch went to
India, and he knows

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:42.740 align:middle line:84%
all the lore and the
Vedic stories and things.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So you know, he's a
transcendental meditation

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:45.840 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.750 align:middle line:90%
And so he really--

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:51.200 align:middle line:84%
to me, when I see David Lynch
and I see him on the set,

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and he's chain smoking and
he's using the F bomb, like,

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:84%
every other word,
and then I hear

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.310 align:middle line:84%
that he does transcendental
meditation, dresses

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.257 align:middle line:84%
all in white, and you
know, I'm like, this guy--

00:43:01.257 --> 00:43:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He seems like he's
intrigued with both realms.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: He is.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:90%
This guy is "Twin Peaks."

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.910 align:middle line:84%
This guy is the duality
that he's trying to show.

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:12.440 align:middle line:84%
He's this dark kind of guy
who is attracted to the light.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to be in
the light, but it's

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.625 align:middle line:84%
like the dark keeps
pulling him down.

00:43:16.625 --> 00:43:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the
show, it showed it

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.680 align:middle line:84%
well with these kind of
creepy, surreal, bleed-throughs

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.900 align:middle line:84%
of the darker aspect of
each of the characters.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's very perceptive.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And each character
that you meet,

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.690 align:middle line:84%
eventually, you discover
that they're not

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.075 align:middle line:84%
the person-- even the Log
Lady isn't the person that you

00:43:38.075 --> 00:43:40.700 align:middle line:84%
thought she was, that she's
this philosophical lady.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Then you find out
she's also dark.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And also what "Twin
Peaks" did was

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:51.260 align:middle line:84%
it opened the door to what
you might call high weirdness

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:90%
or high strangeness.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
general is abducted

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and he's involved in
Project Blue Book,

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and starting to bring in
now for the first time

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.990 align:middle line:84%
some of these
alternative theories

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and histories that people like
you and I, we're really into,

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.290 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't do any TV
shows about them until this.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And then it became
all right after that

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.880 align:middle line:84%
for these kind of subjects
to be talked about,

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.352 align:middle line:84%
which gave really Chris Carter
permission to do "The X-Files."

00:44:17.352 --> 00:44:19.185 align:middle line:84%
Because he could not
have done "The X-Files"

00:44:19.185 --> 00:44:22.880 align:middle line:84%
if it hadn't been for David
Lynch doing "Twin Peaks," which

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.020 align:middle line:84%
was really a precursor
to "The X-Files."

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to just share
that one line in there

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.580 align:middle line:90%
before we hop on to something.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was Laura Palmer--
and I'm forgetting now

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.930 align:middle line:84%
the exact scene,
but I think it had

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:37.440 align:middle line:84%
to do with her cousin, friend,
the good part of her where

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.690 align:middle line:84%
she said, "the angels
wouldn't help you

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.290 align:middle line:90%
because they've all gone away."

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.445 align:middle line:84%
That's the theme
of "Twin Peaks."

00:44:44.445 --> 00:44:47.670 align:middle line:84%
"The angels wouldn't help you
because they've all gone away."

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I find his
work unredemptively dark.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't find any
redemptive qualities.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.340 align:middle line:90%
It shows you what the dark is.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.670 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm having the
same problem and struggle

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:01.310 align:middle line:84%
with the whole
notion of conspiracy.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even like
the word conspiracy.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.920 align:middle line:90%
Darker agendas in general.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Which is, yes, he
can make you aware

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.450 align:middle line:84%
these dark realms
exist, and you can

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.160 align:middle line:84%
be made uncomfortable
and kind of sick

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.580 align:middle line:84%
to your stomach
watching his films.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.880 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Really, as a human being,
as a woman human being,

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.320 align:middle line:90%
what is the point?

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it anymore.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Because if you cannot take away
something that you can have

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:29.860 align:middle line:84%
some sort of action plan or
point to, what is the point

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:30.660 align:middle line:90%
anymore?

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.743 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I think
he has a very good point.

00:45:32.743 --> 00:45:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I used to think that
he didn't have a point,

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:38.100 align:middle line:84%
but I think he has a
very, very good point.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I think he feels sorry for
people like Laura Palmer.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I think he feels
terrible for them,

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that there's these people that
are being sexually exploited

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:90%
by adults, and he hates it.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.010 align:middle line:84%
The same thing's true
in "Inland Empire,"

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.140 align:middle line:90%
his last film that he did.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Laura Dern is an actress, and
she's being horribly exploited

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.110 align:middle line:84%
by Hollywood throughout
the whole film

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:04.275 align:middle line:90%
in satanic and disgusting ways.

00:46:04.275 --> 00:46:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell
that David Lynch

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.230 align:middle line:90%
feels for these performers.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
is just revelation.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:13.969 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's revelation
whereas in "Chinatown,"

00:46:13.969 --> 00:46:16.260 align:middle line:84%
this is Chinatown, there's
nothing you can do about it.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Nothing you can do.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the part
that I have a hard time with.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And they are very
cynical films, I have to admit.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.290 align:middle line:84%
"Chinatown's" a
very cynical film,

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and David Lynch makes
some very cynical films.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:28.830 align:middle line:84%
"Mulholland Drive" perhaps
is the most cynical.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.870 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about "Mulholland Drive"

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:34.260 align:middle line:84%
is, again, he's
portraying how actors

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.350 align:middle line:90%
are exploited by Hollywood, OK?

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:39.680 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about
"Mulholland Drive" is,

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.950 align:middle line:90%
again, we have two characters.

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:42.800 align:middle line:90%
We have Betty and Diane.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Naomi Watts played
the Betty character,

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and she also played
the Diane character.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Through the movie, Betty
shows up in Hollywood, right?

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's like Dorothy
in "The Wizard of Oz."

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's all light and
perfect, and she's from Ontario,

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.425 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:46:58.425 --> 00:47:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And for two hours, she and her
friend, who's also her lover,

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:10.270 align:middle line:84%
do kind of an investigation
into a murder in Hollywood.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:11.070 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And then all of
the sudden, which

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.550 align:middle line:84%
is the most outrageous
thing I think

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I've ever seen in a
movie, at about two hours

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:22.050 align:middle line:84%
into the movie, Betty, the
nice, beautiful blonde, who's

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.200 align:middle line:84%
having this affair with
this other woman, wakes up,

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.920 align:middle line:90%
and she's now Diane.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.735 align:middle line:84%
She's a completely
different person.

00:47:29.735 --> 00:47:33.277 align:middle line:84%
And I started watching the movie
again for Hollywood Decoded,

00:47:33.277 --> 00:47:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and I thought to myself, what
is going on in this movie?

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
that Diane is

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.850 align:middle line:84%
the failed actress who came
to Hollywood, much like Betty,

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.220 align:middle line:90%
all naive.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And she's a failed actress,
and she's creating a fantasy

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.600 align:middle line:84%
about this big movie star,
that she's her friend,

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.510 align:middle line:84%
she's her lover,
she's equal with her,

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.440 align:middle line:90%
she's as good an actress as her.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, she
goes to the tryout,

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and she's really good in
the love scene, right?

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.840 align:middle line:84%
She's, like, great
tryout, and she

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.350 align:middle line:90%
should have been a great actor.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:09.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's all a fantasy, and
the whole thing is a fantasy.

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, as someone who
worked in Hollywood for years,

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.790 align:middle line:84%
those people live
in a fantasy world.

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:16.950 align:middle line:90%
They really, truly do.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:19.812 align:middle line:84%
And she is a casualty
of Hollywood.

00:48:19.812 --> 00:48:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
that movie's about.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And so he has a
deep yearning and, I

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.870 align:middle line:84%
think, a sadness for
especially the women that

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.537 align:middle line:84%
come to Hollywood,
thinking that they're

00:48:29.537 --> 00:48:31.661 align:middle line:84%
going to become big stars
that are just exploided--

00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe we can
use these films as alerts.

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:34.703 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They are.

00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:36.120 align:middle line:90%
They're alerts.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's go another
direction entirely.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Among the films that you
and Jay will be looking at,

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.560 align:middle line:84%
are there some that do have
redemptive qualities at the end

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.610 align:middle line:90%
to them?

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Any?

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a couple.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.228 align:middle line:84%
I know you're
tapping your fingers.

00:48:48.228 --> 00:48:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.760 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot, actually.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:49:01.450 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be covering
the corporate takeover of life

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:05.160 align:middle line:84%
in "Blade Runner" and in
"Alien," because in "Alien,"

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.060 align:middle line:84%
the corporation wants to
take the alien back to Earth

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and use it, weaponize it.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But they're stopped by
the regular working men,

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:13.805 align:middle line:90%
by Sigourney Weaver.

00:49:13.805 --> 00:49:14.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is good

00:49:14.525 --> 00:49:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: All right?

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah and she stops
the corporation

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:17.650 align:middle line:90%
from doing the evil.

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:22.450 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with
Deckard in "Blade Runner."

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:84%
He becomes having
feelings for the androids.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even he's an android.

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of implied
that maybe, possibly he's

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.180 align:middle line:90%
a robot too at the end.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:35.350 align:middle line:90%
So there are redemptive ones.

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.630 align:middle line:84%
"Minority Report"
by Steven Spielberg.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, predictive
programming is not a good idea.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.410 align:middle line:84%
We do not want to arrest
someone for a crime they

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:46.210 align:middle line:90%
haven't committed.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.770 align:middle line:90%
A thought crime.

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Thought crime.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So there are not as
many as I would like,

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:54.490 align:middle line:84%
but I think Jay and I both have
a little bit of a dark view

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:56.350 align:middle line:90%
possibly of the world.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:58.444 align:middle line:90%
But the world is a dark place.

00:49:58.444 --> 00:49:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
also a light place.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.976 align:middle line:84%
Throw a couple light ones in for
me that point us at least back

00:50:03.976 --> 00:50:04.776 align:middle line:90%
that direction.

00:50:04.776 --> 00:50:06.125 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:50:06.125 --> 00:50:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I'll
think about that.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.666 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point, though.

00:50:08.666 --> 00:50:10.130 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't thought about that.

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:11.180 align:middle line:90%
I will think about that.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Because there comes
a point where,

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.550 align:middle line:90%
again, this being alerted--

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and like you said, you
have spent years and years

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.840 align:middle line:84%
rolling around in
what has previously

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.960 align:middle line:84%
been called conspiracy theory,
which is simply dark agendas.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And I came to a point
personally where I thought, OK.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Enough.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to take my attention
toward lifting the game back

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:34.120 align:middle line:84%
up, because people
are so depressed

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and already feel so
overwhelmed and powerless

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:38.420 align:middle line:90%
at this point in time.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sitting right now
where we are in history

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.940 align:middle line:84%
is probably the most
powerless I've ever seen

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.650 align:middle line:90%
at least the American society.

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:48.080 align:middle line:84%
But this isn't just
the American culture.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.430 align:middle line:84%
This same wave of
nationalism and racism

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and corporate takeover,
fascism is actually--

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.470 align:middle line:84%
it's a planetary
happening, so to speak.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not just in this country.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I would say
it's always been here.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just-- it's
rising up from underneath

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and becoming more apparent
so people can't ignore it.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Would you say that--

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.170 align:middle line:90%
which requires action.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Here's the
way I look at it, OK?

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.560 align:middle line:84%
This is going to come
as kind of a shock,

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.600 align:middle line:90%
I think, to a lot of people.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.430 align:middle line:84%
If you have central heating and
central hot water, guess what?

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:31.184 align:middle line:90%
You're richer than 99.99%--

00:51:31.184 --> 00:51:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
absolutely true.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --of all the
humans that have ever lived.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right?

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to take
a perspective here.

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:40.310 align:middle line:84%
You have all the knowledge
ever made at your fingertips,

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:41.330 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:41.750 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:43.333 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago, I had
to go to a library

00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:44.458 align:middle line:90%
to find all this stuff out.

00:51:44.458 --> 00:51:45.791 align:middle line:90%
It would take me hours and days.

00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Now it takes just minutes.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm actually quite
optimistic about the world.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And I think we're arguing--

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.670 align:middle line:84%
there's fewer wars now
than there's ever been.

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:56.360 align:middle line:84%
There's fewer wars
going on, fewer people

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.150 align:middle line:84%
being killed right now
by violence and war

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:00.440 align:middle line:90%
than has ever happened.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.240 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.260 align:middle line:90%
In known human history, OK?

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:04.730 align:middle line:90%
People have more food now--

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:09.290 align:middle line:84%
obesity is the epidemic we're
fighting, not starvation.

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Which, 100 years ago,
it was starvation.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Ireland starved to death.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.566 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
reasons my family came

00:52:14.566 --> 00:52:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to America, to escape the
great Irish starvation.

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.589 align:middle line:90%
And so I think that--

00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I think things are a lot
better than we think they are.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.171 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in that sense,
you're absolutely right.

00:52:25.171 --> 00:52:26.231 align:middle line:90%
And I do agree.

00:52:26.231 --> 00:52:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, because I'm looking at
it more from a spiritual point

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.942 align:middle line:84%
of view, we have what appears
to be insanity around us,

00:52:31.942 --> 00:52:33.650 align:middle line:84%
simply because it's
being allowed to come

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.430 align:middle line:90%
to the surface in full view.

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Which I think is a
good thing, because it

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:40.520 align:middle line:84%
allows us something to respond
to and make our choices from.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And I do agree with you also
that we're at the kindest point

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.300 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of ways-- since
maybe Atlantian times--

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:48.830 align:middle line:90%
we've ever been in.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:54.395 align:middle line:84%
We're not as brutal as human
beings, as we have been.

00:52:54.395 --> 00:52:57.079 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And a lot
of that, by the way--

00:52:57.079 --> 00:52:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I should get back to what we
were talking about before.

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:02.300 align:middle line:84%
When my generation
came back from Vietnam

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and started making movies,
we said, you know what?

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:09.140 align:middle line:84%
When a guy gets shot in the
gut, a little trickle of blood

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:12.080 align:middle line:84%
doesn't flow out, and he
falls over like Gary Cooper.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.754 align:middle line:90%
His guts fall out, all right?

00:53:13.754 --> 00:53:15.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
start showing that.

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:17.461 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start showing
things as they really are.

00:53:17.461 --> 00:53:19.940 align:middle line:84%
We're tired of this kind
of pristine view of war

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and violence that
Hollywood had been doing.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.455 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that made
war less appealing to men

00:53:25.455 --> 00:53:26.255 align:middle line:90%
especially.

00:53:26.255 --> 00:53:28.088 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, there
was a lot of-- there

00:53:28.088 --> 00:53:31.190 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of, obviously, public
protest that actually had

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:33.590 align:middle line:84%
an effect on ending that
war, because we saw it

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:35.100 align:middle line:90%
for the first time on the news.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's exactly right.

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:36.710 align:middle line:90%
We saw the blood.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:40.280 align:middle line:84%
We saw the guys holding
their guts in on TV.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And we said, you know,
this is horrifying.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.381 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to ever be
involved in anything like this.

00:53:44.381 --> 00:53:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think it went a
long way to stopping war.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I think they try to
make war cleaner now,

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.260 align:middle line:84%
like a bomb from an airplane
so that your guys don't

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.490 align:middle line:90%
get hit or anything.

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But even that, when
we see the dead bodies

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.067 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, the shrapnel,
even that makes us all sick.

00:53:58.067 --> 00:53:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And the internet's
showing us the stuff too.

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So every day, we're seeing
the world as it really is.

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Not the way that the puppeteers
are trying to make it.

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
really what you and Jay are

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:08.250 align:middle line:90%
trying to do with this series.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you show us where
the light realms, just one

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.520 align:middle line:84%
time, interface and are, like,
hooking us up the other way

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.000 align:middle line:90%
maybe?

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.520 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I think
the greatest, optimistic,

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.935 align:middle line:10%
light-filled film of all time
is "2001: A Space Odyssey."

00:54:17.935 --> 00:54:19.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well,
that was, indeed.

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:22.640 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: In which the whole
human race is transformed

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.440 align:middle line:10%
into a higher being.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the military
industrial complex could

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.850 align:middle line:84%
finance this film, and then
Kubrick using their money

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:34.240 align:middle line:84%
to dutifully stick it back
to them, that's just look--

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:34.940 align:middle line:90%
because Kubrick loved that--

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.310 align:middle line:90%
We need more of that.

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:38.070 align:middle line:10%
We need to stick
it to them more.
