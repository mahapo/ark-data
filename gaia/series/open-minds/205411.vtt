>>JILL CARNAHAN: I'm in my
20s, and I'm having this life

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.670 align:middle line:90%
threatening diagnosis.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And my gastroenterologist
said, Jill,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.970 align:middle line:84%
diet has nothing
to do with this.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And I went on a journey
to prove him wrong.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Our toxic load, which is
the elephant in the room,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
is increasing day by day, so
we are breeding super molds.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And even babies
that are born now,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:84%
the cord blood has about
200 or more chemicals in it.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Home should be a place that's
safe, and all of a sudden,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:84%
it becomes the most
dangerous thing in your life

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:90%
to your health.

>>REGINA MEREDITH:
One thing COVID

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:10%
has taught humanity is
the need to clean up

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.790 align:middle line:10%
our bodies to create more
functional immune systems.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:10%
This means we need to
take a look at the common,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:10%
but hidden aspects of our
environmental exposure.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jill Carnahan
is with us today

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the molds in
our bodies and environments

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and the carnage they can cause
if they overrun our lives.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:90%
And they're everywhere, right?

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.099 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes, Regina.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome, Jill.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, this is
something that's interesting.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:90%
We were just talking off camera.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into all of this
as so many things that

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:84%
have been identified as kind
of allergens in the diet

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and such actually
have mold at the base,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's being labeled as
something else, such as a lot

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:84%
of people's
intolerance of grains

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
is being labeled as a gluten
intolerance, for example.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to get into
some of this hidden knowledge

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
because you have a
lot of experience,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:90%
even on a personal level.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And you've had your
own problems with mold.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
You've had your other
problems that it led to.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So to let people get
to know you a bit,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:84%
tell us a little bit about
what happened to your own body

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and was this before you were
practicing medicine or after?

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:10%
>>CARNAHAN: At 25, I
was in medical school,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:10%
and I found a lump in my breast.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:10%
And it turned out to be cancer.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So I faced breast
cancer at 25 years old

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of medical
school, a very grueling routine.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yikes.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.690 align:middle line:10%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.492 align:middle line:10%
36-hour shifts and
no sleep often.

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's not
helpful for healing.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: No.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I actually think that's probably
part of the contribution factor

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
We obviously know
how stress affects

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
the immune system
and immune system

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
affects our ability
to fight cancer.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So looking back, that
was my first lesson

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in really going deep and
trying to find root cause.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:84%
In conventional
medicine, we're taught

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
to get to the title
of the diagnosis,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.010 align:middle line:90%
and then we stop there.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And for each diagnosis, we
have a drug, or a treatment,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:90%
or a surgery.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
My goal now and
through my own journey

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
has been to ask
the question why?

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.473 align:middle line:84%
Why is this happening, and why
is the system breaking down,

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and what can we do to
actually reverse that process,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and get wellness, and get
this patient to walk away

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
from disease, instead of
just walking towards it?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So my cancer experience
at 25 was my first kind

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
of awakening to,
wow, I'm in my 20s,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'm having this
life-threatening diagnosis.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And the first question,
of course, was why?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Why did this happen to me at 25?

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And women in their 20s,
it's a much more devastating

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:90%
diagnosis.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.905 align:middle line:90%
So it was very aggressive.

00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:14.132 align:middle line:84%
I faced the battle
of my life and did

00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:84%
all the conventional
treatments-- chemotherapy,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:90%
radiation, et cetera, surgery.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I came out of
that, I thought, yes, I

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
beat cancer and
ready to move on.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And then six months
later, I started

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
having symptoms of fevers,
and diarrhea, and pain,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and weight loss, and I was
diagnosed with Crohn's disease.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
still wanted to be

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.148 align:middle line:90%
a doctor with 36-hour shifts?

00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Still
in the midst of it.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And so, once again, I
thought, what in the world

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:90%
is going on here?

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the
chemotherapy had basically

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:84%
triggered an already
predisposed system

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
to this autoimmune process.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So then I became well advised
on the journey of autoimmunity

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:90%
and how this happens to people.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And I remember sitting
with my gastroenterologist,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Jill, diet has
nothing to do with this.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was naive, a 26-year-old
at that time, medical student.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have a lot of
nutritional background,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
but I knew in my
heart and my intuition

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that diet did have
something to do with it.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And I went on a journey
to prove him wrong.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what
kind of diet is--

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:84%
because you have to do kind
of a grab and go thing,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
I would think, with
those kinds of shifts

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of stress
and pressure on you.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.785 align:middle line:84%
So I take it you weren't on an
all-organic, home-cooked kind

00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:90%
of diet in your 20s?

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Right.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I was always health conscious,
but I still, like you said.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in hindsight
is that about 14 or 15,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:90%
I decided to be vegetarian.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Nothing wrong with that, but
for my body, what I did instead

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.493 align:middle line:84%
was gravitate towards
processed foods,

00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:84%
so it was more
like a carbitarian.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.118 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I did it too.

00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I was a carbitarian
for 20 years.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.658 align:middle line:84%
So unbeknownst to
me, I was getting

00:04:48.658 --> 00:04:50.950 align:middle line:84%
processed foods,
soy-based, and things

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:90%
that weren't good for me.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had a
gluten-full diet, which

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know the other
piece of the puzzle was

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:90%
I was a silent celiac.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I had celiac, didn't
know it, and the gluten

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
was contributing to
inflammation as well.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So was it the
cancer protocols then

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
that kind of wiped out the
natural immune system that

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
led to essentially Crohn's
disease and dysfunction

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:90%
in the guts?

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Absolutely, and
it's such an easy picture now

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:84%
to see because I
grew up in a farm

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
with lots of pesticide exposure,
probably had an impaired gut

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:90%
microbiome before the cancer.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The chemicals
probably contributed

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.713 align:middle line:90%
to the cancer diagnosis.

00:05:25.713 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You kind of went
over that pretty quickly.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:84%
You grew up in
Illinois on a farm.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:90%
And what were you farming?

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So my parents
had corn and soybeans.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so classic,
and they weren't organic.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Right.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you got those--

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Sprayed
with pesticides.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we know now that
those kind of chemicals

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that are used on the crops,
like organophosphates, they're

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:90%
endocrine disruptors.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.613 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Breast
cancer is a disease

00:05:48.613 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:84%
of the endocrine
system, so these

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:90%
are disruptors of that system.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And in someone who genetically
can't detoxify well,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I always say we're all born
with an ability to detoxify.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
bucket that we have,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:84%
the ability to pour out
the bucket level of toxins.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:90%
My bucket was really small.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.627 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, do you
think you were genetically

00:06:06.627 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:84%
predisposed to that or you
just had such an accumulation

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:90%
over a lifetime of exposure?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: I think it was dual.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think I had a very poor
detox system to begin with,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and then I think even in
utero in my mother's womb,

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I probably started to get
exposures through her,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and then when I grew up,
continued to get exposures,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and so by the time I was
25, that DNA damage already

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.997 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And
then what happened

00:06:29.997 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
there was the
drugs that they use

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:84%
for cancer are very harmful to
rapidly-dividing cells, which

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
line the gut, so that basically
induced a much more permeable

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and damaged gut lining.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And in someone like
me who has already

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:84%
had the celiac going on, which
is a severe gluten intolerance,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
it really destroyed the gut and
led to the Crohn's diagnosis.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So it was just
this crazy circle.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, God,
yeah, what a mess.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And did that lead to
leaky gut as well,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
although we'll get to that
a little later, because you

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.010 align:middle line:90%
said it became permeable.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And my understanding
is a very high percentage

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:84%
of the population
over 40 has leaky gut

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:90%
and is just unaware of it.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Regina, two things.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there's
Cytoxan is one of the drugs I

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:90%
took for chemotherapy.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And Cytoxan in the
literature is actually

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
shown to induce leaky gut as one
of the mechanisms the body uses

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:90%
to fight the cancer.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:90%
So to me, it's profound.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It's actually taking this
drug induces this permeability

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:84%
because that
permeability creates

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.890 align:middle line:84%
a trigger to the immune
system to fight the cancer.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.973 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: But it also creates
a massively permeable gut.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
is I now assume

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that everybody who walks
into my office has leaky gut.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: 100%.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, 100%.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: 100%.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well, thank you
for sharing your personal story

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
because it certainly shows
you had the motivation

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:84%
to gain more in-depth knowledge
than what was being given

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.060 align:middle line:90%
in medical school, number one.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really
a big part of it.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people can't
afford alternative care,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, they need more
than just the alternative.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's nice that
you've been to be

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
able to use both aspects of
allopathic and integrative

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
medicine in your practice, but
we're really focusing on toxins

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and one of your
great specialties

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is mold, like we talked about
in the open of the show.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:90%
So you know, it's ubiquitous.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.813 align:middle line:84%
And what I wondered
before I wrote the script

00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and we were going
to do this show,

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:84%
I thought throughout
humanity, people

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:90%
have lived in dank caves.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
They lived in musty
dwellings in medieval times,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and mold has always
been in our environment,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.827 align:middle line:90%
yet I don't know that the body--

00:08:46.827 --> 00:08:49.160 align:middle line:84%
we don't know because people
didn't live to be that old,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
but I mean, I'm wondering if
the human being had a better

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
capacity in times
past than it does

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.650 align:middle line:84%
now because of the sheer
variety of the toxic load today.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So talk to us about
molds, what it

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:84%
does to the body, how
simple molds in the past

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
may have affected us versus
what we're dealing with today.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Just take it away
and chat with us.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: You got it.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And I love talking
about this because this

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:90%
is part of the conundrum.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Our grandmothers had
mildew in the shower,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.065 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't a big deal.

00:09:17.065 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So we say, well, why now are
we having such an epidemic--

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: --of
issues with mold?

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:84%
The way I see it
is our toxic load,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the
elephant in the room,

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
is increasing day
by day, year by year

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:84%
with exponential release
into our environment

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
of chemicals and toxins,
pesticides, and even

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:84%
things in our material world,
such as plastic water bottles.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Our food supply often has
preservatives and chemicals.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.998 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, clothing
that's made with--

00:09:42.998 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes, so
everywhere we go.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.915 align:middle line:84%
And our skin, of course, is
a massively absorptive organ,

00:09:46.915 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:84%
so we're getting it
through the environment.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
I always am teaching
patients clean air,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
clean water, clean food is
the foundation of healing.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds so simple that
people gloss right over it,

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
but actually taking
in these things

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and trying to have a deliberate
approach to a cleaner lifestyle

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:84%
is so key because, like
I said a few minutes ago,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:90%
the bucket is filling up.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
now is our buckets

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
are more full than they
were 20, 40, 60 years ago.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And as our buckets are full--

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and even babies
that are born now,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:84%
the cord blood has about
200 or more chemicals in it

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:90%
as they're born.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's unbelievable
that we can even

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
survive in this world as
we are with that load,

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:84%
but our bodies are created
to survive and to detoxify.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.130 align:middle line:84%
However, this load is
becoming such a burden

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that the mold on top of
that, it just tips it over.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like the straw that
broke the camel's back.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that just
takes us over the edge.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of it
is this toxic load.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:84%
People aren't aware, and it's
becoming greater and greater.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And the other part
of it is in the '70s,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
we saw the problem
with indoor molds.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And well, let's just put an
anti-fungicide and anti-mold

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:90%
in the paint.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.995 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, all
the commercial paints

00:10:56.995 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:90%
had fungicide in them.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was it selectively

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:90%
killed off the weaker molds.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So now, what we
have growing indoors

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:84%
is typically a much
stronger and robust.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
antibiotic resistance.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So we give the
cattle and the feed

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:84%
supply this large
dose of antibiotics,

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and we create resistance
in the bacteria,

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.650 align:middle line:84%
so the strains that we have in
the hospitals now some of them

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:90%
are untreatable.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:90%
The mold is very similar.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:90%
It's smart.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:90%
It's crafty.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So we are breeding
super molds, and we're

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:84%
seeing in the indoor
environments a lot

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:90%
more toxicity because of it.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yikes.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about
what molds are doing.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are coming in,
if they can get in to see you,

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
but people come into
your office and you're

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.190 align:middle line:90%
assuming they have leaky gut.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assume that
you assume that many of them

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
have had mold exposure
once they start

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:90%
talking about their symptoms.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty common
problem, right?

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: It's
shockingly common.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: My experience,
it goes back about five years

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
when my medical office flooded
in the great flood of Boulder

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:90%
in 2013.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I was here
when that was happening.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.820 align:middle line:90%
That was wild.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Unbelievable.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unbelievable.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.585 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And so I already
had this older office.

00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I had a second floor
office built right

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:90%
above a crawl space.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
The crawl space had permanent
water sitting there,

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
unbeknownst to me, and then
later with the flooding, got

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:90%
worse.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I had an old carpet,
and the contractor

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
threw on a bamboo floor
over this old carpet.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So I was basically
puffing up bits

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:90%
of mold of toxins everywhere.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.762 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's awful.

00:12:25.762 --> 00:12:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: I didn't know
it, but my health declined.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I was, the year prior, running
5Ks, and active, and healthy.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting a lot
more tired, a lot more brain

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:90%
fog, word-finding difficulty.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.800 align:middle line:90%
My eyes got red and swollen.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:90%
My skin broke out.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
what is going on?

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that mold
could be an issue,

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really think
about it at that time.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you know that
the contractor had done that?

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: I did, but
I was clueless about it.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.378 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think about the
ramifications of that.

00:12:53.378 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's poor practice.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: It
was awful, really.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And then in the basement
later when we were looking,

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.940 align:middle line:84%
we found bulk
Stachybotrys, which

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:84%
is a very toxic black
mold, in the basement-- so

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
that level, the crawl space,
and then my office up above.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:90%
But I really was getting sick.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was not
functioning well.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.450 align:middle line:84%
My office manager, who had
been with me eight years,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
she later told me, Jill, I
thought you had cancer again,

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
like you did not look good.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.720 align:middle line:90%
So that was my journey there.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I figured out it was
mold, I did a test in my urine

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:84%
that showed
mycotoxins in my body,

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and then we found the
bulk in the basement.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
the ah-ha moment.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the day
after Christmas 2015

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:84%
when I got the results, and
I thought, oh, this is mold,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and I have to figure
this out because if it's

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:84%
affecting me this way, it's got
to be affecting other people.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't
know the depth

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that I do now about mold
until I experienced it myself.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's--

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of hesitating
to bring this up

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.073 align:middle line:84%
because it could be just
one of those complete non

00:13:55.073 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:84%
sequiturs that goes
nowhere, which is fine.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll just toss it out there
because you were talking

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:84%
about how crafty and
intelligent mold is

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:90%
and fungus is for its survival.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, tell
us the difference

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
between fungus and mold,
and its effects on our body?

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes, so
like I said, there

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:84%
are different
levels of toxicity,

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually related to
the production of mycotoxins.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So each of these
molds-- in fact,

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.900 align:middle line:84%
we've gotten brilliant
medical discoveries.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
things that we daily

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:90%
use like digestive enzymes.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are made
from mold because mold

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
produces enzymes to
digest cellulose,

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:90%
which is building materials.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
They're smart and
crafty, so they

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
know how to digest
drywall and sheetrock.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
use that technology

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
to create an enzyme that
helps us digest food.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:90%
How crazy is that?

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is crazy.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:84%
So tell us how the molds
can trash our systems

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and what some of
the obvious effects

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:84%
are, so we would know if
we might have this issue.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And also, I'm curious about the
difference between the presence

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:90%
of molds and funguses.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: OK, so
symptoms, we'll start there.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because this
is also called a multisystem,

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
multisymptom illness
because it can masquerade

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:84%
in almost any system
in the body and it

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
could masquerade as
autoimmunity, cognitive

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:90%
decline.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:84%
It could masquerade as gut
issues, neurological issues.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So often, we have these silos
in conventional medicine--

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:84%
rheumatology, gastroenterology,
neurology, et cetera.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So you got to one for your
brain, one for your gut.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And these silos have kind of
separated medicine instead

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:90%
of bringing it together.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is
something like mold

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
or environmental
toxicity in general,

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:90%
it affects all systems.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you're stuck with
one of those silos,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that person may be
having blinders on

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and looking at a very
small piece of you

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and not looking
at the big issue.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So mold always
affects many systems.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.825 align:middle line:90%
That's part of its nature.

00:15:52.825 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you just have one symptom,
like just have headaches

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's it, it's
probably not mold.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you have headaches
plus gut distress

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
plus cognitive decline or memory
issues, then it could be mold.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And the top symptoms we
see cognitive are huge.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Mold absolutely affects
the brain and the mind.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I work
with Dale Bredesen

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:84%
who's done a lot of research
on reversing Alzheimer's

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:90%
and written several books.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And he postulates that one in
three of his early Alzheimer's

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:90%
patients is mold.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.260 align:middle line:90%
That's one third.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.427 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ooh, one in three.

00:16:22.427 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: One in
three, so a large number.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.403 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also
because Alzheimer's seems

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:84%
to be on the rise, in
terms of the percentage

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.760 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Especially younger,
40s, 50s, like unbelievable.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Brain fog--
and brain fog as well.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Mm-hmm.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.175 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and we give
that term brain fog,

00:16:37.175 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:84%
as you and I know
what that means

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:90%
and most people do listening.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.728 align:middle line:84%
But what it is just feeling like
you can't focus or concentrate.

00:16:42.728 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the
middle of the mold,

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
for example when I would
write an article or a blog,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:90%
it might take me an hour.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:84%
In the midst of the mold,
it took three or four.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It took a lot more
concentration and effort

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:90%
to get through that fog.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Word finding is kind
of unique to mold,

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:84%
so you might want to say
cat and you say dog instead.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.778 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So having
articulation to the wrong words

00:17:00.778 --> 00:17:02.843 align:middle line:84%
or things, or I would
even be typing an email

00:17:02.843 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:90%
and I'd type the wrong word.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, where
did that come from?

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like having
a little spirit hopping up

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:90%
and giving you strange words.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:90%
So the brain is hugely affected.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:90%
The gut is very affected.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:90%
So we talk about leaky gut.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
Mold is probably one of the most
potent inducers to a permeable

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.582 align:middle line:90%
gut or a leaky gut.

00:17:19.582 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is I'll
just give a little description.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, please do
because it does affect so many

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And there's lots
of things that cause leaky gut.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think of it as like
tiles on your bathroom wall,

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and the grout that's
between your tiles

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.400 align:middle line:84%
is keeping those tiles tight
on the wall and waterproof.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
permeable gut, you

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:90%
have these little enterocytes.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:90%
Those are the gut lining cells.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
They're just one cell layer
thick between the lumen, where

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
our food goes, and
the bloodstream.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And that grout in between, it
gets dissolved in a leaky gut,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:90%
so you have this permeability.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And things that should normally
be transported by mechanisms

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
are just they can
go right through.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
you might eat corn

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and a corn antigen just
goes right through.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
The immune system says what
is up with this piece of corn

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.320 align:middle line:90%
in the immune system?

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Invader, yeah.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And it creates
an immune response.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you have
food sensitivities or food

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:90%
allergies that are increasing.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.832 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, you can't
eat corn, or you can't eat soy,

00:18:08.832 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:84%
you can't eat sugar
without reactions.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And that leaky gut
with mold, there's

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.590 align:middle line:84%
a molecule produced by
our brain called MSH--

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is usually
affected by mold

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and that will cause more
permeability in the gut.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.562 align:middle line:84%
So we frequently see mold
exposure, gut permeability.

00:18:29.562 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:84%
How patients will present
is they'll say, like,

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jill, all of a
sudden, I'm becoming

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:90%
really sensitive to foods.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting rashes, or I am
getting a headache after I eat,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
or I'm not digesting
my food, so they'll

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:90%
have all kinds of gut issues.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.337 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
said this is one

00:18:44.337 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:84%
of the common signs is
that suddenly, you're

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
not just allergic to
one thing anymore,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.360 align:middle line:84%
but suddenly, you can't
tolerate this, this,

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and the list continues to grow
where you're allergic to food

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:90%
itself it seems.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.867 align:middle line:90%
Is that a sign of leaky gut?

00:18:56.867 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: That's
a sign of leaky guy

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and that definitely
can be related to mold.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I always say, does it feel like
your box is getting smaller,

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.443 align:middle line:90%
like it's closing in on you?

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have four
foods that you can eat.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's often the
case, and that definitely

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
a huge percentage of people
have been exposed to mold.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And what mold can also do is
because of the permeability

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and because of the
disruption in the cells,

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
it can lead to overgrowth
of bacteria or yeast

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
in your small bowel, and then
that can also damage the gut.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So then people will come in,
and they'll have a lot of gas

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and bloating,
especially with foods

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
like broccoli, or cabbage,
or cauliflower, or apples,

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:90%
or pears.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:90%
These are FODMAP foods.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.813 align:middle line:84%
And then that bacteria
will ferment that food

00:19:36.813 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and they'll get very
bloated, or they'll

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.438 align:middle line:84%
have loose stools, or
other symptoms like that.

00:19:40.438 --> 00:19:42.688 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about the molds
is the molds themselves,

00:19:42.688 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:84%
the spores, those
aren't so harmful.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just going
to say grandma's moldy shower

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
curtain is the least
of the problems.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Right, right.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.313 align:middle line:90%
But what they produce.

00:19:50.313 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you something.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:90%
This will blow your mind.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
It's right along the line
with what you just shared.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So one of my colleagues, a
doctor, did a small study.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And what he did is he had
Petri dishes, two of them.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.060 align:middle line:84%
One was under a regular
household router,

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.440 align:middle line:90%
like a Wi-Fi system.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:84%
One was shielded with aluminum
under a regular router.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
The one that was unshielded
with the EMFs, the Wi-Fi router,

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:84%
produced 600 times
the mycotoxins

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:84%
because that mold felt that
electromagnetic frequency

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:84%
as a threat and it
produced more mycotoxins.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm seeing as
well with-- again, to me,

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
this is mind-blowing-- in
these high rises, Wi-Fi

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and say there's mold,
these are much more toxic

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:84%
because the Wi-Fi concentration
is so much greater.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that the Wi-Fi
necessarily is causing harm

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:84%
to the human cells, but
it causes a threat signal

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.453 align:middle line:90%
to the organisms in our body.

00:20:38.453 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is a
huge part of what we are.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes, yes.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.787 align:middle line:84%
There's more DNA from bacteria
in our gut by billions

00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:90%
than there is cells in our body.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.578 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a big deal if it's

00:20:48.578 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:84%
affecting all the little things
that we are comprised of.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:10%
And what we're seeing now
is drugs, and this EMF,

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:10%
and all these things,
so many things

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:10%
are studied on human
cells in Petri dishes

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:10%
and they're said to be safe.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Digress a little bit,
glyphosate is one of them.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:84%
On human cells, it
looks safe, but what

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
we know to be true
is just like EMFs,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.380 align:middle line:84%
these actually affect
the microbes in our body

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.893 align:middle line:84%
and it has the effect on our
health through the microbiome.

00:21:11.893 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happens to these guys?

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.977 align:middle line:84%
So they're exposed
to all of this.

00:21:14.977 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They're exposed to
these EMF frequencies,

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.560 align:middle line:90%
the Wi-Fi, et cetera.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell the difference
in living in the country

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and staying in a high rise
hotel, like night and day.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:90%
What's it doing?

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
What are the bacteria,
mold, and viruses

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.518 align:middle line:84%
doing once they've been
stimulated by EMFs?

00:21:31.518 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Well, I'm
going to just postulate off

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
into a little cartoon world
because this is what I imagine.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.443 align:middle line:90%
There's these bacteria, viruses.

00:21:37.443 --> 00:21:39.318 align:middle line:84%
They're all living in
harmony under this kind

00:21:39.318 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:90%
of protective biofilm layer.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:44.165 align:middle line:84%
And they get the signal
as like a threat to them.

00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And this thing called
quorum sensing,

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:84%
which just means a sharing of
information among organisms.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:90%
It's proven.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they're
having chitchats

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.485 align:middle line:84%
about how do they
survive because we're

00:21:53.485 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:90%
all out for survival.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what do
they do to survive

00:21:55.985 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:90%
and what's its effect on us?

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah, and
they're exchanging

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.590 align:middle line:84%
DNA to protect themselves
against our weapons

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
of antimicrobial agents,
antifungals, antivirals, et

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
strengthening.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes, yeah.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
becoming smarter

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and they're strengthening.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And
they also throw off,

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
just like the plant
kingdom throws off

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:90%
poisons and different things.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I was
going to say, the toxin.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the off-gassing.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.432 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So the
thing that we're seeing,

00:22:16.432 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and I think this is so the
toxic load we talked about.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.448 align:middle line:84%
The other piece that
I think we're seeing

00:22:20.448 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is they're becoming smarter,
stronger and the toxins they're

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
producing are so harmful for our
immune system, for our brain,

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.870 align:middle line:90%
for our skin, for our gut.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So we are suffering from
the effects of the toxins

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:90%
they are producing.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was getting to.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.405 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is all very much
need-to-know information.

00:22:40.405 --> 00:22:42.405 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
what we can do about it,

00:22:42.405 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:84%
but before we do, there are a
couple other little factoids

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:90%
here that I found interesting.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is that mold
creates a PTSD response.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:90%
What does that even mean?

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Oh, I am so
glad you asked, Regina.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So I've been doing
functional medicine 20 years

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and really focusing on mold
and environmental toxins

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:84%
for about 10, and especially the
last 5 with my own experience.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.515 align:middle line:84%
And what I've seen
now is I have patients

00:23:08.515 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:84%
that have been waiting, or
come from other doctors,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.010 align:middle line:84%
or have seen other
people and still stuck.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And I know the mold piece well.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I know how to get them
out of the exposure,

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:84%
then how to detoxify
their system

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and treat any infections,
or overgrowth, or load.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:90%
So that's easy.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.120 align:middle line:84%
But what I find is some
people are still stuck

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.410 align:middle line:90%
and they're not well.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And my question, again,
I love to ask why.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.660 align:middle line:84%
So part of the why
was what else is here

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
that's keeping these
people from getting well

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and that's keeping them
in a reactive state,

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.292 align:middle line:84%
because what happens is
they become very fearful?

00:23:41.292 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:90%
So there's two parts of this.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Mold can affect the brain
and the limbic system.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So it actually affects the
hippocampus and the amygdala,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:48.980 align:middle line:90%
which are both organs.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Hippocampus is our memory
center and amygdala

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:84%
is our fight or flight center,
so it's the threat center.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So the physical
effect of the toxins

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:84%
actually damage and cause
problems to the brain.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:84%
That's a piece of it,
but the other piece of it

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
is we have this
exposure, and it creates

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
a traumatic
physiological response,

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:90%
and our body remembers that.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's traumatic enough
that the next time we

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.823 align:middle line:84%
get an exposure, it retriggers
that traumatic loop.

00:24:12.823 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
a physical PTSD.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: It is, it is.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's subtle because
you can be very strong,

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
you can have done your therapy
and your emotional work,

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
but what I find the piece to
getting them well is dealing

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:90%
with limbic activation.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's this limbic
loop, I like to call it.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.738 align:middle line:84%
And it can happen
from childhood trauma.

00:24:28.738 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It could happen from
an emotionally abusive

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.530 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.288 align:middle line:84%
It could happen
from-- but here, it's

00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:84%
happening from a
physical-chemical trigger.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, yeah.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And to me, that's
like mind-blowing because I

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:84%
know about trauma, and
toxins, and emotional health,

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and healing, and
that's important,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:84%
but I never really put the
two together until recently.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm seeing
miracles in healing

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:84%
because as patients deal
with that limbic activation,

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.370 align:middle line:84%
they can actually become less
reactive to their environment.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And my theory is in
childhood, a couple of things.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:84%
First of all in
childhood, often maybe you

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.980 align:middle line:84%
had a traumatic experience
during childhood

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and you also were in
a moldy environment.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, your body
and mind subconsciously

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:90%
tagged the two of them.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So like if I'm in mold, it's
just difficult or it's painful.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
they become linked.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah,
so unlinking them.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And then part of my work
is the physical, the detox.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:90%
That's easy.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:90%
I could do that in my sleep.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.950 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
I'm finding now

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:84%
taking these people to healing
is for them to do limbic work.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And that could look like, of
course, somatic, or therapy,

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.160 align:middle line:84%
or working with someone who's
an expert in those fields

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
like, EMDR, or
thought field therapy,

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.950 align:middle line:84%
or any of those modalities,
but it could also

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
look like retraining
your limbic system.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:84%
There's DNRS is one of
the programs out there.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:84%
There is binaural beats, which
is listening to different beats

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
in different ears, the hertz's.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:90%
There's craniosacral therapy.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
There is HeartMath,
which is a way

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.990 align:middle line:84%
to retrain your ability to have
a heartrate variability that's

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:90%
very smooth.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:84%
But all of these
things are now becoming

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.920 align:middle line:84%
essential for getting that
physical healing from mold.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I think when people take on
something as more of a mindset

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and say, you know,
I've read this,

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm supposed to
do, and become habitual or rigid

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:84%
in their eating
habits, I mean, there's

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:84%
something to be said for, as
you say, having a healthy diet

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and trying to go as
natural as possible.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But rigidity, I don't
think is a very good thing

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:84%
because by virtue
of it alone, you're

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
not listening to your body
when it's asking for something

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.670 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: That is brilliant.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.365 align:middle line:84%
You're catching all these
really detailed nuances

00:26:32.365 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:84%
that I don't usually
get to talk about,

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.365 align:middle line:84%
but I love that
we're going there

00:26:35.365 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:84%
because rigidity is
really common in mold as

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
well because it
creates, in some people,

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:84%
an almost OCD state where
they're obsessive compulsive

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:90%
or they really isolate.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a chemical we make
in our brain called oxytocin.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a love hormone.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.930 align:middle line:84%
We get it when we're hugging,
breastfeeding, after sex.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's a connection hormone.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And mold absolutely
affects production

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:90%
of oxytocin in many people.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So what I've seen is,
in fact, my experience,

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I remember the year after,
I was almost like a hermit.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty social, but
all I could do was survive.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:90%
I went into survival.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.510 align:middle line:84%
I pulled back, and I had
almost no social life.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my divorce came
a year after the mold,

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.580 align:middle line:90%
and there's no coincidence.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So that is really important
because that rigidity makes

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.352 align:middle line:90%
it very difficult to get well.

00:27:20.352 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, another one I
wanted to go down is--

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:84%
before we get into
all the things

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:84%
we can do to kind of
eliminate the mold

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and feed ourselves, mind, body,
and soul, a little better--

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:90%
mold depletes glutathione.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
glutathione, its role,

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and what the
implications of that are.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So glutathione
is our master antioxidant.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It is the main thing that's
produced by a methylation

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And if any of our listeners
are savvy with that,

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
they've heard all kinds of
doctors talk about methylation.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But the core purpose
of methylation

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:84%
is fixing cellular DNA
so we don't get cancer.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
It's creating our
neurotransmitters,

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:84%
so we're happy, and
sleepy, and calm.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's also preventing a
toxicity, so helping our detox.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And the production in that
cycle is of one main ingredient,

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:90%
and that's glutathione.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So glutathione
basically helps us

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.010 align:middle line:84%
when we get this toxic
load in our little buckets,

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and we want to unload
and bail out that bucket.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Glutathione is like the
bailer-outer of the bucket.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Fancy word for that.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So that glutathione
is so critical.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And we have this weird
dichotomy because we have this.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
We come in and said toxic
load is a predisposing factor,

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.688 align:middle line:84%
and toxic load will
deplete glutathione.

00:28:27.688 --> 00:28:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get
in a mold environment,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:84%
I always say it just tanks,
it wipes out glutathione.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
my patients might

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.940 align:middle line:84%
present with heavy metal
toxicity or other toxic load

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is the mold
sabotaged their detox system.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So not only is mold
super toxic, it

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.110 align:middle line:84%
sabotages the very system
that might help get rid of it.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that's so
critical in getting rid of mold

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is helping a person
produce more glutathione,

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk about all
the ways that happens.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.393 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we'll
talk about that.

00:28:58.393 --> 00:29:00.893 align:middle line:84%
Also, can you kind of supplement
your way back to an extent?

00:29:00.893 --> 00:29:01.693 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:29:01.693 --> 00:29:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, so you can.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So some people, like for
myself in the beginning,

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even
tolerate glutathione.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But ideally in my
patients, I'll give oral.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not well-tolerated.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.567 align:middle line:84%
The stomach will
disintegrate the glutathione,

00:29:12.567 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:84%
so if you just
take a glutathione

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.910 align:middle line:84%
without it being in a certain
form, you won't really use it.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So we need to give either
liposomal, or precursors,

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:90%
or IV.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:90%
We give it IV, intravenously.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.140 align:middle line:84%
We give it inhaled
for lung issues.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:84%
We can give it subcutaneous
as an injection, so many,

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.420 align:middle line:84%
many ways we can
give it and routes.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.590 align:middle line:90%
There's also precursors.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So the things that I use that
make glutathione in the body

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
would be N-acetyl
cysteine, vitamin C,

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.410 align:middle line:90%
glycine, glutamine, lipoic acid.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So often, we'll give a
cocktail of precursors,

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.277 align:middle line:84%
and then let the body make
the glutathione itself.

00:29:50.277 --> 00:29:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brilliant.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we need
to get to what we

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.920 align:middle line:84%
can do to start reducing the
mold in our environment, how we

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:84%
can start detoxing
it out of the body,

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and then kind of the
ideal way to carry on

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.293 align:middle line:84%
from there once we've
gotten it under control.

00:30:05.293 --> 00:30:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Love that.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So the thing that's most
important if people are

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.560 align:middle line:84%
listening is you cannot truly
heal if you have a massive mold

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:84%
exposure, so getting out of
that environment in some way is

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:90%
critical to the healing.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no amount of
IVs, or supplements,

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:84%
or positive mental thinking that
can overcome if you're living

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.160 align:middle line:90%
in a very toxic situation.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard, and I
want to pause for a moment

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
because most often, it
involves changing jobs, moving,

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.545 align:middle line:84%
or remodeling your house It can
be expensive, and it can be.

00:30:35.545 --> 00:30:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of people
who don't have the resources.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So I have a lot of
compassion over that step

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
because it can be financial
devastating to some people.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:84%
However if we don't address it
in some way, shape, or form,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.910 align:middle line:90%
that patient won't get well.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.452 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the people

00:30:50.452 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that identify mold
and how accurate

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.450 align:middle line:84%
their analysis usually
are, because you can call

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.800 align:middle line:84%
in people to identify
mold throughout your home,

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.380 align:middle line:84%
your attic, basement,
and so forth.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And generally speaking,
is their technology

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:84%
up to snuff in your opinion
because obviously, this

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.863 align:middle line:84%
is something of
extreme concern to you?

00:31:07.863 --> 00:31:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes,
so the difficulty

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.190 align:middle line:84%
there has been so we
have mold inspectors

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and they can take
a weekend class

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and call themselves
whatever they want,

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.010 align:middle line:90%
so it's not highly regulated.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.630 align:middle line:84%
There's also indoor
air professionals.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a little bit broader
because they look at radon,

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.720 align:middle line:90%
they look at air quality.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And I like to use the
indoor air professionals,

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.260 align:middle line:90%
and they're fairly regulated.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
group called ISEAI

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that's a nonprofit for
professional doctor

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:90%
remediators--

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:84%
International Society for
Environmentally Acquired

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Illness.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
If patients want to
look up information,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:84%
that's a repository
of information.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And ISEAI is another group
as well for the air quality.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.150 align:middle line:90%
So there are some stipulations.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:84%
These people usually come in,
they'll do air quality testing,

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.560 align:middle line:84%
but visual inspection
is important

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and looking like infrared
cameras will detect moisture

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:54.010 align:middle line:90%
in walls.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So you really need
someone who's like I'm

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.880 align:middle line:84%
the medical detective
of the human body,

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.610 align:middle line:84%
this would be a house
detective, someone who

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.410 align:middle line:90%
knows what they're looking for.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.320 align:middle line:84%
People who can't
afford an inspector

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.610 align:middle line:84%
or want to start themselves,
I will often have them

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.290 align:middle line:84%
do either the Home Depot,
Lowe's Petri dishes,

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:84%
where they can sit
them out in their house

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.123 align:middle line:90%
and see if anything grows.

00:32:13.123 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a cheap, easy way.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Not perfect, but one
small way to look.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Or we do dust
samples called ERMI--

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.420 align:middle line:84%
E-R-M-I. And patients
can order these online,

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and they can take a dust sample
and send it in for analysis

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:90%
of what's in that dust.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, those
aren't perfect ways,

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.780 align:middle line:84%
but I actually find the dust
sampling is better than the air

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.928 align:middle line:84%
sampling in some cases because
some of the most toxic molds

00:32:34.928 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:84%
are sticky and wet, and
they don't go in the air.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So you really
kind of have to know.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I've had to become a little bit
of a mini environmental expert

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.240 align:middle line:84%
just for the sake
of the patients.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.808 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, you can test, you can
inspect, and that's critical.

00:32:45.808 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to find the source.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So most people live in
these beautiful homes

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and just because it's a new home
or a multimillion-dollar home

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:84%
does not preclude
it from having mold.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Many of the most
beautiful homes I've seen

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:90%
could have mold in them as well.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So finding that source because
it's not usually visible.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can think back to
did washer or dryers leak?

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Did we have leaks
from the kitchen sink?

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Was the tile installed properly?

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.720 align:middle line:84%
There's all these little
nuances of what might happen.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you on that.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:15.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, let's go to
detoxing it from the body--

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.280 align:middle line:84%
the most direct, simple,
inexpensive, anybody

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.980 align:middle line:90%
can do it methods of detox.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Got it.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:90%
So we're out of the situation.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, we detox.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Glutathione is key.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.855 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that.

00:33:24.855 --> 00:33:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So whatever way, shape,
or form are precursors.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.600 align:middle line:90%
You need glutathione.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Then the second thing
would be helping the liver.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So what happens with
these toxins is they

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.450 align:middle line:90%
get into our cells and tissues.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And as we do things
like infrared sauna

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.600 align:middle line:84%
is a great way to
detox, Epsom salt baths.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And something that
most allopathic MDs

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.730 align:middle line:84%
don't talk about, but can be
very critical is coffee enemas.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:84%
This can actually enhance
glutathione production

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.410 align:middle line:84%
through the liver with
the enterohepatic--

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:53.602 align:middle line:84%
it's like the colon-gut
connection-- by 600%.

00:33:53.602 --> 00:33:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, you have
a much higher production

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:56.610 align:middle line:90%
of glutathione.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So some people
use those as well.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.770 align:middle line:90%
So getting that liver working.

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And in the liver phase, I'll
use milk thistle and back

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.790 align:middle line:84%
to N-acetyl cysteine, lipoic
acid because what we want to do

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.380 align:middle line:84%
is we want to get
the toxins that

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.290 align:middle line:84%
are stored in the
fat of our tissues

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.219 align:middle line:84%
out into the bloodstream, and
then filtered by the liver,

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and then the liver will dump
them into the gallbladder.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.110 align:middle line:84%
The gallbladder stores bile and
that's where they're stored.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the bile is
excreted into the gut

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.469 align:middle line:90%
out through our stool.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
binders come in

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.489 align:middle line:84%
because binders are a huge
part of getting those out.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ooh, like
charcoal and all.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:28.929 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And what I think of is
it's like a helping hand

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.250 align:middle line:90%
that kind of grabs the toxins.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:84%
It escorts it out, like, hey,
like the bouncer in the bar.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:90%
Hey, guys, time to get out.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:38.679 align:middle line:84%
So they're grabbing
on with a charge--

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:42.100 align:middle line:84%
an electrostatic charge--
with like charcoal, or clay,

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.710 align:middle line:84%
or chlorella, or glucomannans,
or cholestyramine.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.469 align:middle line:84%
These are all
binders, and they all

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:84%
have a charge that attaches
to different toxins.

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So I usually use
combinations because you're

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:55.420 align:middle line:84%
getting different bouncers
that grab different toxins

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.380 align:middle line:90%
and pull them out.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And they pull it
out through the gut.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's the way because
that bile has the toxins.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
These bind to bile, and
they pull them out, and then

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:84%
get rid of them
through the stool.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the critical pieces.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So out of the environment,
enhance glutathione production,

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.980 align:middle line:84%
support the liver, gall
bladder, and use binders.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And that right there would be
kind of a core basic protocol.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can do that.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Virtually everyone
can afford to do that.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, let's look
at some of the foods

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:23.390 align:middle line:84%
that we're eating
where it's hidden.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.247 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get to
this whole grain thing

00:35:25.247 --> 00:35:27.580 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of times, people
think, oh, my God, I just

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.380 align:middle line:90%
can't do grains.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.890 align:middle line:90%
I feel sick.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And we think, oh, well, that has
to do with gluten, for example,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.107 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily
true, you say.

00:35:35.107 --> 00:35:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah, so
this is just my theory,

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.120 align:middle line:84%
but I've seen it happen enough
that I think it might be true.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Grains are the most highly
contaminated food group

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.450 align:middle line:90%
with mycotoxins and molds.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Lot of our studies, there's
loads of studies in animals

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.260 align:middle line:84%
because the people who
raise cows and pigs,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.760 align:middle line:84%
they know their
production goes down

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.250 align:middle line:84%
if the food gets moldy,
whereas there hasn't

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:90%
been that many human studies.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that have
been done, many of them

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.690 align:middle line:84%
are done from people, and
children, and other groups

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:84%
in Africa where the grain's
got highly contaminated

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.530 align:middle line:90%
with mold or that.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's often the
moldy grain supply

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.920 align:middle line:84%
is where they're doing
some of the data research.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So the grains are
highly contaminated.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Sadly in the US are stipulations
for the quality of coffee,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and chocolate, and
grains, which are all

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:22.005 align:middle line:90%
potentially contaminated.

00:36:22.005 --> 00:36:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I always joke two of my
favorite food groups,

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.405 align:middle line:84%
coffee and chocolate, are very
highly contaminated with mold.

00:36:27.405 --> 00:36:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there
are mold-free lines

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.210 align:middle line:90%
of coffee, for example, right?

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we just go
online and do a search

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.890 align:middle line:84%
or are there are a
couple that you know of.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: I have
done the research.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So Bulletproof Coffee by
Dave Asprey is a great brand

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:90%
and so is Purity Coffee.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Purity, OK.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.752 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: That's the
one we drink in our office

00:36:42.752 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and those are the two
that I typically use.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.108 align:middle line:90%
Chocolate is a little tougher.

00:36:46.108 --> 00:36:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that there's
any that are certified.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.248 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: But I think the
more organic, fair trade,

00:36:51.248 --> 00:36:53.175 align:middle line:84%
one source is going to
be a better choice--

00:36:53.175 --> 00:36:54.330 align:middle line:90%
the chocolate that we love.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
an exception in here

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.340 align:middle line:84%
because we were talking
off camera about it.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I find there's one bread
that everyone in my household

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:90%
gets along great with.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.510 align:middle line:84%
It's produced locally in our
little foothills community.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And they have a two-day
fermentation process

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.040 align:middle line:84%
plus organic and heirloom
grains to begin with.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.440 align:middle line:84%
But the two-day fermentation,
let's talk about what

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.940 align:middle line:84%
happens when you get
a true sourdough.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So the reason that's way
better tolerated, first

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.440 align:middle line:84%
of all, gluten content
in our typical US wheat

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and the bread basket
is actually bred

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.720 align:middle line:84%
to have a very high gluten
content, which is also

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.660 align:middle line:84%
why some patients who are
gluten intolerant go to Europe

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and eat freely of
bread with no trouble,

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:84%
but they come back to the
US with pizza and breads

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and they do poorly
because in the US,

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the production has a much
higher gluten content.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So back to the sourdough, what
happens with that is gluten

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.630 align:middle line:84%
is like a pearl necklace,
strung all along.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.207 align:middle line:84%
And part of the problem with
it is it's a very long necklace

00:37:51.207 --> 00:37:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have the
scissors to chop it up

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.720 align:middle line:90%
into little bits, many of us.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So that little chopping process
makes it more digestible to us.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.598 align:middle line:84%
Many of us lack the
enzymes to break it down.

00:38:00.598 --> 00:38:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So even if you don't have
celiac, a lot of people

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.350 align:middle line:84%
have gluten intolerance
because they're

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.630 align:middle line:84%
lacking that DPP4
enzyme, which is

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:middle line:84%
the scissors that
chops up the necklace

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.260 align:middle line:90%
into bite-sized pieces.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So with the sourdough
bread, the enzymes

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.390 align:middle line:84%
in the fermentation process
are like the scissors,

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.328 align:middle line:90%
so they prechop that gluten.

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They predigest.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Predigest, exactly.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
it's better tolerated.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I can speak
to that because none of us

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:84%
get along that well
with breads per se,

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.763 align:middle line:90%
but we can do that just fine.

00:38:30.763 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And those
heirloom varieties

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.380 align:middle line:90%
are also less gluten potent.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:90%
They're lower gluten content.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning,
the grains themselves

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.343 align:middle line:84%
are a little bit
less high in gluten.

00:38:40.343 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So we can all look
for sources of that.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.840 align:middle line:84%
In terms of other
foods to kind of stay

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:84%
away from besides chocolate, and
coffee, and grains with molds,

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.653 align:middle line:84%
is there anything else that
contain high amounts of molds?

00:38:55.653 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah, so
speaking of fermentation,

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.410 align:middle line:90%
there is a subset of patients.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.860 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that can
cause the brain fog, the leaky

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.337 align:middle line:84%
gut, and all the issues
in mold is histamine.

00:39:04.337 --> 00:39:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, talk about that.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:07.378 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And this
relates to the food.

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So often what will happen is
when you get exposed to mold,

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.670 align:middle line:84%
there's something called mast
cell activation disorder--

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.710 align:middle line:84%
MCAS for short-- and
a very long word.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
All it means is our
cells that are defenders,

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.090 align:middle line:84%
some of the basic
primordial cells

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.880 align:middle line:84%
called mast cells, throw
out histamine, throw up

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.700 align:middle line:84%
prostaglandins, create
inflammation, swelling, pain,

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.290 align:middle line:84%
brain fog, all
kinds of symptoms.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And mold happens to be one of
those poke-the-bear triggers

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.035 align:middle line:90%
of those mast cells.

00:39:33.035 --> 00:39:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
mast cell experts

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with who don't
know anything about mold

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.380 align:middle line:84%
know mold is a big trigger
to this mast cell activation.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us
back to histamine.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Often patients who have mold
issues who have been exposed,

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.120 align:middle line:84%
they're producing
more histamine.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And so then if they eat foods
that are high in histamine,

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.090 align:middle line:90%
that's a trigger.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us examples
of foods high in histamines.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically when
protein breaks down, it

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.710 align:middle line:84%
creates histamines, so
leftovers or a fish that's

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.810 align:middle line:84%
been caught fresh
and not frozen,

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:04.620 align:middle line:84%
but sits out or sits in the
countertop at your local food

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.410 align:middle line:84%
store for three days
and breaks down.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Dried jerkies and smoked meats
are also higher histamine.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So are aged cheeses, or moldy
cheeses, or blue cheeses.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.478 align:middle line:90%
And then so are fermented foods.

00:40:17.478 --> 00:40:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
there's a dichotomy.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so interesting
because I really stay away

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:84%
from all of those things,
not for any reason

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.550 align:middle line:90%
except I am naturally cautious.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.325 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be around
leftovers, for example.

00:40:30.325 --> 00:40:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't like leftovers.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: You have
such a good intuition

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.260 align:middle line:84%
because that your body knows
oh, that's not the best.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.177 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I
don't like blue cheeses.

00:40:36.177 --> 00:40:37.680 align:middle line:84%
A long time ago,
I'd have a little.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.120 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
talking about, and I'm

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.290 align:middle line:84%
sure there are many
people listening

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.160 align:middle line:84%
that automatically
have no attraction

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.570 align:middle line:84%
toward those things, so anything
breaking down, even including

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.713 align:middle line:90%
fermented foods, which--

00:40:47.713 --> 00:40:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: OK, so
this is the dichotomy

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.240 align:middle line:84%
in why it's important to
talk about it because we hear

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:84%
the health bone broth, which
is another high histamine

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:56.200 align:middle line:84%
food, which you
wouldn't think of.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And same with yogurts, or
fermented kefirs, and things

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.090 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Kombucha is a big one.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And for patients who
have had massive mold

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.870 align:middle line:84%
exposure, histamine issues,
mast cell activation,

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.423 align:middle line:84%
they probably will not feel well
on those kind of health foods.

00:41:11.423 --> 00:41:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, let's say your body
is not overwhelmed with molds,

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:21.070 align:middle line:84%
then let's talk about the
beneficial effect then

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.702 align:middle line:90%
of these fermented foods.

00:41:22.702 --> 00:41:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So you just have
to kind of see how

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.210 align:middle line:90%
your body is responding to it.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:25.322 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Exactly.

00:41:25.322 --> 00:41:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
it's for a season.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.703 align:middle line:84%
So you get through the
mold, and then you're

00:41:28.703 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:84%
back to adding in
fermented foods.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Fermented foods
contain probiotics,

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.238 align:middle line:84%
so they contain
those bacteria that

00:41:33.238 --> 00:41:37.300 align:middle line:84%
are quorum sensing and creating
the bacteria that our guts like

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.045 align:middle line:90%
and house in our microbiome.

00:41:39.045 --> 00:41:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So basically,
they're better than

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:84%
taking any probiotic
capsule, as far

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.252 align:middle line:84%
as seeding our gut with
the good bacterial.

00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:47.752 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And that
helps us digest.

00:41:47.752 --> 00:41:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
sourdough, such an equivalency

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.530 align:middle line:84%
because when we eat those, then
they help us digest the food.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about sugar.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So sugar is a
big one because usually what

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:84%
happens is it's not just an
exposure, but like I said,

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:05.170 align:middle line:84%
your sinuses, or your gut, or
in other places in your body,

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.600 align:middle line:84%
even your lungs could
be colonized with mold--

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.090 align:middle line:84%
mold and yeast, which
would be like Candida,

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.160 align:middle line:84%
which is not mold, but
it's similar in the sense

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.467 align:middle line:84%
that Candida takes advantage
of a weakened immune system.

00:42:15.467 --> 00:42:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
mold, we didn't even

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:18.842 align:middle line:84%
talk about immune
system, but often there's

00:42:18.842 --> 00:42:20.602 align:middle line:90%
a weaker immune system.

00:42:20.602 --> 00:42:21.685 align:middle line:90%
So then Candida overgrows.

00:42:21.685 --> 00:42:23.530 align:middle line:90%
You have mold, Candida.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.760 align:middle line:90%
They love sugar.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So you're just feeding the
bad guy when you eat sugar.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.420 align:middle line:90%
And you usually crave it.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of patients crave it,
but getting rid of sugar

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:84%
is a real big part of
the mold-free diet that

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.450 align:middle line:84%
would help someone heal
in the midst of that.

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the final thing,
the big organ, the skin,

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.770 align:middle line:84%
you say dry brushing,
Epsom salt baths.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important
to clear the toxins off

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.450 align:middle line:90%
of the skin of the body?

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah, so
lymphatics are an organ

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.200 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't get any respect.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And lymphatics are part
of our drainage system.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So all of the things you
mentioned-- the infrared sauna,

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:00.250 align:middle line:84%
the Epsom salt baths, the dry
brushing, there's even PEMF--

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Pulsed Electromagnetic Field--
where you can have a mat

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.070 align:middle line:84%
or a device that gives you that
frequency and helps your cells

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:08.260 align:middle line:84%
produce the right
energy for healing--

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.230 align:middle line:84%
all of these things help
get rid of the toxins.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:15.238 align:middle line:84%
And we have our skin, our
lungs, our kidneys, our liver.

00:43:15.238 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Those are kind of
all the main detox.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.030 align:middle line:84%
We have stool, and urine,
and sweat, and all of that.

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And so aiding each of
those is really critical.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And I usually find if you're
just taking supplements

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and you're not doing some
of these other procedures,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:29.710 align:middle line:84%
you get more stuck
or you get more sick

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.120 align:middle line:84%
as you're going through
the detox process.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So part of that just
helps people tolerate

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.820 align:middle line:84%
the detoxification process
because you're just helping

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.320 align:middle line:90%
your body eliminate it quicker.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.080 align:middle line:84%
You have just given
us a tremendous amount

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.160 align:middle line:90%
of useful information.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for that, and also ask

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.110 align:middle line:84%
is there anything we've
missed that we must talk about

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:90%
before we say goodbye?

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Well, if patients
are out there listening,

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.410 align:middle line:84%
or anyone who's heard this,
or has a family member,

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:54.970 align:middle line:90%
or starts to say, well, what?

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:57.640 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the awareness is
number one because many people

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:84%
with this, they've been
told they have dementia.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:02.380 align:middle line:84%
They've been told
they have gut issues.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:84%
They've been told--
we didn't even

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:05.537 align:middle line:84%
get to talk about hormones,
but this would massively

00:44:05.537 --> 00:44:10.160 align:middle line:84%
disrupt hormones, thyroid,
adrenal, and endocrine system.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you have other issues
and you haven't found answers,

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:84%
the number one thing is keep
looking and could it be mold.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Just asking the question
and checking your home.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And then number two,
patients who have experience,

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:23.720 align:middle line:90%
this is overwhelming.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.513 align:middle line:84%
It can affect the
mind, the body.

00:44:25.513 --> 00:44:26.680 align:middle line:90%
It can affect your finances.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.775 align:middle line:90%
It can affect your home.

00:44:27.775 --> 00:44:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And as we talked about
the limbic activation,

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.247 align:middle line:84%
home should be a
place that's safe.

00:44:31.247 --> 00:44:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it becomes
the most dangerous thing

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.240 align:middle line:90%
in your life to your health.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing I want
to impart is there's hope.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.220 align:middle line:84%
There is ways that you
can get well from this.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.950 align:middle line:84%
There's ways that
you can detoxify.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:44.320 align:middle line:10%
And if you find a functional
medicine doctor or some

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.198 align:middle line:10%
of the ISEAI groups,
that one of the things

00:44:46.198 --> 00:44:47.740 align:middle line:10%
I've been working
on in the last year

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.750 align:middle line:10%
is a mold detox
box, like something

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.510 align:middle line:10%
that would just put
everything together,

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:53.645 align:middle line:10%
like a Happy Meal for mold.

00:44:53.645 --> 00:44:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.320 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.153 align:middle line:90%
That's a great idea.

00:44:56.153 --> 00:44:58.112 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah, we're
working on putting that

00:44:58.112 --> 00:45:00.640 align:middle line:84%
together so that people have
a simple solution to get well.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for a lifetime of gathering

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:06.640 align:middle line:84%
this information for
us, a lot of personally,

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I find a lot of the
information very useful

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:10.810 align:middle line:84%
to kind of take up
after I get home.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Wonderful.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:13.627 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know a lot of
others watching this do too.

00:45:13.627 --> 00:45:16.285 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much for taking
the time to be with us today.

00:45:16.285 --> 00:45:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: You're welcome.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.800 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can reach
out to Dr. Carnahan

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.720 align:middle line:10%
at jillcarnahan.com.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I wish us all luck
in cleaning up our toxic load.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
