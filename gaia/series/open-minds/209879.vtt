>> What kind of entities
were you dealing with?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So many, actually, just
this inter-dimensional highway.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You say, basically,
I'm not crazy.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:90%
I just see things.

>> She said, I don't think
you're schizophrenic.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I think something
else is going on.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:84%
She said, I think
you're psychic.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Through my psychic
development, I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:84%
knew that I had to
be super present

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:84%
because psychic information
only comes in the now.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It was almost an
electrified way of being human.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I am an Akashic Records
reader, and that

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
might be different
from a psychic reading.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Although I think psychic
readings are so valuable,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.295 align:middle line:84%
but one of the obstacles
that one can run into is--

>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Raise your hands

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:10%
if you have felt out of
sync with the normal world

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:10%
around you.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:10%
You're not alone.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Our guest today, Bonni
McCliss, felt very out of sync

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:84%
with the world, only to find
that she was just psychic.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.697 align:middle line:90%
So welcome, Bonni.

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:90%
It's good to have with me.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BONNI MCCLISS: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm excited.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so gosh,
you had a rough ride.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I did.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I really did.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my God.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A psychic,
as a little kid--

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've interviewed
a lot of people

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
who were psychic and saw things
when they were a little kid,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
but what happened to you is
just crazy because you were

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
literally singled out and
almost tortured as a result.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's just dive
right into your life

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
as a little kid and the
things you were seeing

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and how your parents and the
world around you reacted to it.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah,
yeah, absolutely.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.108 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in hindsight, when
I think about it, I'm like,

00:01:40.108 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know how--

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's horrifying.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.335 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah--
how I survived.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:10%
But at the time
of the experience,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:10%
I just was mostly
just trusting what

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:10%
I was told to a certain extent.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:10%
But so early on, it
was quite natural

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:10%
for me to have
these conversations

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:10%
or these experiences.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:10%
My earliest memory
would be these lights

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:10%
that would hover over my bed
at night when I was little,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:10%
almost had like an
angelitic choral sound.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was beautiful.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:90%
And I would tell my mom.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as
parents do, she

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
would say, oh, it's
just your imagination.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
You're such an over
imaginative child.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:90%
So that was beautiful.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I had
the classic "psychic child"

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:90%
imaginary friend exchange.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.210 align:middle line:90%
And that was fairly accepted.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:90%
My mom-- bless her.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:84%
She tried so hard
she made dolls when

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.213 align:middle line:84%
I was young to try to
embody all of my friends.

00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's actually
very supportive and sweet.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: She was.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:90%
She tried.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
She really was just guided
by the medical community

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's when
things got a little off track.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So as I just stayed
this wide open child

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
when I became early
adolescence, around 11, 12,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
I started to scare the adults
around me by maintaining this.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because when
you're a little kid

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and you have little
imaginary friends, it's cute,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.903 align:middle line:84%
but by the time you hit puberty,
it's not really cute anymore.

00:03:03.903 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:90%
They're scared, right?

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: No, no.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're like,
is she crazy or what?

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you had this
time in your life

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
though where you were very
comfortable with your quote,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
"imaginary," in other words,
the other-dimensional friends

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and guides that
were speaking to you

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:90%
and keeping you company in life.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you started interacting
more with other children

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and you thought, well, that's
strange they're the ones

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
that-- the guides feel
totally normal and simpatico.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.478 align:middle line:84%
It's the kids that
feel a little odd.

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yes,
that's exactly right.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and then at
that point, I kind of

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
had that odd man out, had
a hard time making friends.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Which I think was
another indicator

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:90%
that something different was--

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:90%
something was setting me apart.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.720 align:middle line:84%
But again I think
as human beings

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:90%
we just know what we know.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to know where
we're different until we

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:84%
meet that contrast until we
meet that kind of fear of it.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So as I got older my mom brought
me to a series of doctors

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and they all had their different
ideas but really at the end

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
the last doctor said--
gave me the diagnosis

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:90%
of early-onset schizophrenia.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.222 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you were talking

00:04:12.222 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:90%
to people that weren't there.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like
someone on the street

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
who has lost their
bearings seemingly

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
but the thing is a lot of
the people on the street who

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:84%
have lost their
bearings are also

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
dealing with other dimensional
beings talking to them.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Right.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:90%
And feeling the emotions.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I think as a child
it was I could

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
feel such extreme emotions,
which I think a lot of people

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:90%
right now can relate to that.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
have just these cry

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:84%
fits because I could
feel the pain of another.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So again they could
not understand

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
why I would have these
emotional mood swings.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
because there didn't

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
seem to be any stimuli for it
in your third-dimensional world.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of
experiences were you

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:84%
having at that time
when you say you would

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
take on the emotions,
what kind of entities

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.045 align:middle line:84%
were you dealing with,
were you interacting with?

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: So many actually.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I think when you are
that open as a child,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:90%
it's just a smorgasbord.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's just this
inter-dimensional highway.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So with everything from I
think now just non-human forms,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:84%
to spirits, to just
these just pockets

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:90%
of human pain and energy.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And again as a
child, you're trying

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
to find your own identity
and find your own voice.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But mostly early on I
noticed a lot of the pull

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.167 align:middle line:84%
would be from deceased loved
ones or earthbound spirits.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was wondering.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: That would definitely
have a message or a call.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we get
into the early teen years

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:90%
where you've been diagnosed.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.242 align:middle line:90%
So then what happens?

00:05:45.242 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: The doctor that I
was seeing at the time thought

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:84%
that it was just kind of
a culmination of events,

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
that I should go
into a facility.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So they went ahead and
placed me into a facility,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:84%
putting me on heavy, heavy
drugs, heavy antipsychotics,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:84%
which the psychic visions
changed drastically

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wrote
about red eye rats.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't your friends anymore.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that it tweaked
your brain frequencies simply

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
to a level where you were kind
of accessing lower dimensional?

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Exactly.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
exactly what happened.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe it brought
me to the lower planes.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Which I'm grateful
for now to see

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.558 align:middle line:84%
like the many different
dimensions in time and space

00:06:29.558 --> 00:06:30.600 align:middle line:90%
that I was involved with.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, absolutely, I
think it brought my world

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:90%
to a lower realm indefinitely.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so during this
time what happened with you?

00:06:39.495 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're obviously
you're out of school

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
during some really critical
years, you're not bonding

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and making friends during
these times when girls really

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.563 align:middle line:84%
kind of like liked to chat
a lot and need each other.

00:06:49.563 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
That was-- none of that
was happening for you.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: No, no, no.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the medication
that I was put on

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
distorted my
eyesight quite a bit.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of hung
out in the shadows.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I took solace in some
kind of different state

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it kind of lost
memory in that time.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
But I just kind of got
through and just did the best

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:90%
that I could.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And you know, again
gaps in education and--

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long
did this go on?

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: The actual
institution wasn't that long,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.510 align:middle line:84%
it was just a few months
but it was coming out of it,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:90%
trying to find that baseline.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I actually even
remember the moment

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I was fighting and
rallying, trying

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:84%
to even as a young
person acknowledge

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
this as a special thing
or a beautiful thing.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
To kind of stand up for
the other side in a sense.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And with nobody validating
that and with nobody giving me

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
feedback that
that's an option, I

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
remember that single moment
where I just said fine,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:90%
have it--

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be right,
then I give up.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And I just told myself
maybe you are hallucinating.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.607 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just that
shift in perspective.

00:08:00.607 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
you got out of there

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
you were in acceptance that
you were hallucinating?

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.308 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
comes a point where

00:08:07.308 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing
with a psychiatrist

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to
look at the veracity

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
because you say
basically I'm not crazy,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I just see things, right?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she put
you through a test.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.162 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's talk about
that because that was really

00:08:22.162 --> 00:08:24.523 align:middle line:84%
a breaking free point for
you wasn't it, a liberation?

00:08:24.523 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes it was.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I remember coming
into the office

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
of this beautiful
benevolent woman.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Just this doctor and just kind
of exposing my heart and just--

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I just remember crying
for the first session

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
and giving her my background
of being schizophrenic.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And fully assuming that I was
still at this point broken,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
even though I saw things, didn't
know there was another option.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And she listened to me so
lovingly and so patient

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.357 align:middle line:90%
until she gave me this news.

00:08:54.357 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
She said I don't think
you're schizophrenic.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I think something
else is going on.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
and I think great,

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
another diagnosis, here we
go, I've been through so many.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.185 align:middle line:84%
And she said I think
you're psychic.

00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
what's that mean?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:90%
You know, what's a psychic?

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.073 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't believe it.

00:09:12.073 --> 00:09:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I did a little research
and of course, I

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
loved Sylvia Browne on Montel
but didn't see myself that way.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
But she said OK if
you don't believe me

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put you
through a little experience,

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:90%
a little test.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So she said close your eyes,
and I want you to tell me,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:90%
what does my house look like?

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And I panicked.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:90%
I was so nervous.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.623 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking I don't
want to disappoint her,

00:09:35.623 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
she's my first grace
I've seen in a while.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said I don't know
what your house looks like.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:90%
And she said yes you do.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing her confidence
even at this juncture.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And so she kept pushing
me a little bit more

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
just to kind of really trust
my instincts and I did.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, well you live
in a white house, two-story.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:90%
She said yeah, I do.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Keep going, Bonni.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like a Cape
Cod style, Cape Cod style.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said that's
exactly right.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to get a
little confidence to trust this

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and I went on to tell
her about the cats

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.770 align:middle line:90%
and she said yes, I love cats.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I have cats everywhere
and the flowers.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And basically, she said
see, do believe me now?

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:84%
One person to see you
and become your advocate.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yes,
that's all it takes.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After all that you'd
been through with the mistrust

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:90%
and misdiagnoses.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just to me so sad that
people don't believe children.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes, right.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I think
that's so changing.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.218 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a foreign
timeline at this point.

00:10:39.218 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really does.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and even
then it was starting

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:84%
to change but it didn't
change in your neighborhood

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:90%
not just yet.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.532 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: No, not fast enough.

00:10:45.532 --> 00:10:47.543 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
you get past this,

00:10:47.543 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:84%
now you're alerted to
the fact you're psychic.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.835 align:middle line:84%
You figure out what psychic
means, you've just proven it.

00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:84%
How does your life change
from this moment forward?

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, my life changed
drastically because I felt--

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I thought about
what she had said,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:84%
although it was
hard to hold that.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:90%
It's such an identity shift.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, well what are
your choices, you can be broken

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.395 align:middle line:90%
or you can have a gift.

00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Like that's really
what you're up with.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And it helped me to
kind of reflect back

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
to those moments of connection
and love and sanctuary

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:90%
that I had in early childhood.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So I made this active
decision to embody this

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:90%
to the best of my ability.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And to bring it back.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So I read everything
that I could and listened

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to everything that I
could and just poured

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:84%
all over these
metaphysical masters that

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:90%
have come before me.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember thinking,
now this makes so much sense.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, just
being so protected,

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:84%
being able to be embraced
in this and then supported.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And I just opened up
practice in the office

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:90%
of the doctor that helped me.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:11:57.295 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, she
said, OK, go ahead,

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
just I wouldn't call yourself
psychic in this small town.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Maybe say--

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.757 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what did
you call yourself?

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: We called
it intuitive--

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
intuitive reader or
intuitive counseling.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you sometimes
even work together a bit?

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: We did.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Man, what a wonderful
woman that she not just helped

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
you see yourself but trusted
you enough as a fairly

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.400 align:middle line:90%
young woman it sounds like.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: She did.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To be
able to even assist

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.200 align:middle line:90%
with maybe challenging cases.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yes, and she
maintained her oath.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:90%
She didn't give me anything.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe at best I would
get a first name,

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and I would just feel and
describe what I'm seeing

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and she would just
take it in and she

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:90%
would work with other clients.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And she would sometimes
bring me to their attention

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, you can
speak with this intuitive

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:90%
and maybe it'll help.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And it even graduated
to the point

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
where we would hold
energetic circles

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:90%
for those that were suffering.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:90%
So this woman was renegade.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Renegading in the
mental health community.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it was in
the back room in a time

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.543 align:middle line:84%
still where people were very,
very intimidated by this work.

00:13:03.543 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
brave, wonderful woman.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: She was amazing.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Still is.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So from
this point on, OK,

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:84%
you're helping in the
office and so forth,

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting
to also understand

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.412 align:middle line:84%
things about the soul because
you've also studied a lot,

00:13:15.412 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:84%
you've done a lot of
research, and you're

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:90%
embracing some masters' works.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.155 align:middle line:84%
So now how did your work
progress with others?

00:13:23.155 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I feel
like when I was

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
given the keys to the kingdom
and confidence it in some ways

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
helped me remember even prior
unions with these higher

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:90%
sentient beings.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So the cavities of
my own consciousness

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:84%
expanded and I started
to receive concepts

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and understanding for
the individual that

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:84%
would come and see
me but then also

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
how it fit in a
larger scale for us

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:90%
as kind of a unifying species.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
that I did anything

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
worthy of really
opening this up other

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
than just beginning to trust and
stabilize and ground and hold

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:06.860 align:middle line:84%
sincere intentions
to heal and to help.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So I quickly outgrew that back
room and I moved to the city

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
into a metaphysical bookshop
where again open arms

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and I just opened up
my practice there.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:90%
And it was just--

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you say--

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
the word you used for
it is soul intervention.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk
about what that is.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Soul
interventions I believe

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.500 align:middle line:84%
is extracted from this
concept that we refer

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:90%
to as the Akashic records.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Akashic records
holds this full spectrum map

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when people
lose faith or they lose sight

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:84%
or they become
capsized with fear

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.313 align:middle line:84%
they can't quite pick
up on those milestones

00:14:48.313 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:90%
they're meant to meet.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
That they can't walk through
those specific experiences

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:90%
that are going to set them free.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So when we get into this
idea of soul interventions,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that we would progress them
to these moments of influence

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:90%
or impact.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it would turn
out it was a familial pain,

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:84%
like an epigenetic cycle or
a trauma from their childhood

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we would go there and
we would re-acknowledge it

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%
or we would put light on it
or look at it a different way.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So often if you just
give people the space

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledge that
they're there safe

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and they can return
to their Akashic map,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:90%
they just pick right up.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this can be past
or future or present, correct?

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yes, it
can be all of it.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it's all
happening at the same time

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but we just need to find those
wrinkles, those times where

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:84%
we hit again the wall of fear
or that shadow side for whatever

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:90%
reason.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.418 align:middle line:84%
So many different reasons that
people can kind of hit that.

00:15:49.418 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I tell them they're
out in the weeds,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
we just need to bring them back
onto that straight and narrow

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:84%
path that their soul
knows instinctively.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were doing this

00:15:57.285 --> 00:16:01.130 align:middle line:84%
by being able to offer a psychic
glimpse into what was waiting

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:84%
there for them that
they were about to touch

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.040 align:middle line:90%
but hadn't made it yet?

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's not really
interfering with their path?

00:16:06.978 --> 00:16:07.778 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:16:07.778 --> 00:16:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had to use a
certain amount of discernment

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:90%
to not overstep I assume?

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
very instinctual to myself

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:84%
at least, where I feel like true
healing and growth comes when

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:84%
an individual recognizes
their true self,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
their light or really releasing
of the illusion of fear.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I would offer insights
to things that I would see

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
or opportunities in this, really
encapsulating their greatest

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:90%
gift, their talents.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And often they would just
acknowledge that, feel that,

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:84%
or remember their
childhood thoughts around.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
were doing for them

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:90%
what that woman did for you?

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Well said.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:51.695 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:51.695 --> 00:16:52.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:52.495 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
You were helping give
them that validation

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:84%
so they could have
confidence in themselves.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the point
was to ultimately

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:84%
be able to do this work
internally for themselves?

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what did that
blossom into and where are you

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:90%
with it today?

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at the
overarching kind of messages

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking at today
and sharing with people.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:10%
I'm so grateful
for my background

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:10%
and it's led me through many
different paths and mediumship

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.200 align:middle line:10%
but it seems like when
it takes that sum total

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:10%
it's about helping people
access their records,

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:10%
these Akashic records.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And finding out where they
belong in the here and now.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
biggest messages that

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:84%
has been relayed to me
from my higher guides

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is that we need to move into
this kind of non-binary path

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.170 align:middle line:90%
or this non-judgmental.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Like we're so
self-judging of self

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and we're so hard on what we
think we haven't accomplished

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
or the mark that we
haven't met in the future.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So I noticed with people it's
very powerful to help put them

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:84%
in touch with their
now, to help them

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.770 align:middle line:84%
see what cycle that
they're working on

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.477 align:middle line:84%
And why the root system of
that runs so very, very deep.

00:18:09.477 --> 00:18:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would
assume that what

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:84%
you see with most people is they
have not developed the ability

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:90%
to occupy the moment, the now?

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the fear of the
past, the anxiety of the future

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't occurred yet.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you assist someone
into coming into their presence

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.295 align:middle line:84%
now, where everything
is happening now?

00:18:32.295 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: And it's
complicated, right?

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not easy.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: And
even meditation, I

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
have so many people that
sit and try to meditate

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and they give it
like two minutes

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.933 align:middle line:90%
and they're like, I can't do it.

00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm never doing it again.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And my theory with
that is when you

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
come back to the
present moment I mean,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:84%
you are met with
no filter in a way.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have the landscape
of fear, you have the mind.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You have all that
you've ever been.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And so if you could think
about the sheer velocity of all

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
of you without the
filters or the framework

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
it's just sometimes
more than one can hold.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So my path with
working with people

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:84%
is definitely to lead
them into the stability

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
of their own heart and to know
that the things that they're

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:84%
afraid of either exist in
some version of an illusion

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
or to help them see the
purpose of their own path.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Again in my background
seeing how all of the bricks

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
were laid even to lead
me up until this point.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
So finding that stillness
and even mindfulness

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
or learning to acknowledge
that you're not alone,

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.502 align:middle line:84%
that you have guidance, you
have guides looking out for you.

00:19:45.502 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the time.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Every single minute.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 24/7.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.412 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I think that
helps ease the transition

00:19:50.412 --> 00:19:53.165 align:middle line:90%
into the treacherous now.

00:19:53.165 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would think one
of the problems at the moment

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:84%
is because we've been through
this technological revolution

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.878 align:middle line:84%
and so many people, their
brains are operating

00:20:02.878 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
at a little different
speed than they

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
used to just because of
the quick satisfaction

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and interaction with technology,
that it's more and more

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.640 align:middle line:84%
difficult, especially
for younger generations

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:90%
to be able to sit still.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Or think autonomously.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or think autonomously.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a lot
of younger clients?

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I do.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be
absorbed into the flashing

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:90%
lights or the quick pace.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering how
do you bring someone

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.390 align:middle line:84%
back to themselves when
the brain has been--

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
really become in almost
addictive patterns

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:43.637 align:middle line:84%
of such quick gratification
and external authority.

00:20:43.637 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: We have
to proceed at first

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:90%
with some kind of mental detox.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that
comes in phases.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It took us a long time to
become-- to kind of go off

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:90%
the map in a way.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So I ask these young
people or anybody actually,

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.530 align:middle line:84%
just to kind of make
these small adjustments,

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:84%
put the phone down midday and
go outside and just do five--

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
if you can, do five
minutes of deep breathing.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So we start with this kind
of mental detoxing zone.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: And then we move
into an empowering lifestyle

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
with communicating with
sacred things such as nature

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:90%
or our higher selves.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So I find the breaking point
is when people can really

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
sense again who their
higher guides are when

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:84%
they make that
relationship possible

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:90%
or just make that connection.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:84%
When they can feel the
hum or the resonance

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:84%
in their body shift
they're kind of hooked.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.185 align:middle line:84%
It becomes more powerful than
even social media for some.

00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hallelujah,
that's wonderful.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so part of this
you do something

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:90%
called the brain bypass.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.613 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about that.

00:21:46.613 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So I think one of
the things where we've really

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:84%
gotten kind of
confused is self-trust.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's so easy to chalk up our
intuition or these things that

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.120 align:middle line:84%
will flicker in the back
of our mind to imagination.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So the brain I've noticed
through my studies

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and research, that
it just tends to be

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:90%
some kind of patterning organ.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So it has a hard
time breaking free

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:84%
from its own little
infrastructure and box.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we do start to
separate and kind of go

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:84%
into altered states
of consciousness,

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
our body starts doing
these abreactions

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and putting us sometimes
into fight or flight.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So we have to kind of
retrain our pathology.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So the brain bypass
suggests that we just

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
go into this kind of
free association of mind

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and that we practice
asking a question

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and receiving an answer that
doesn't hold a lot of weight.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes with my clients.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll say just what is
the first animal that

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:90%
pops into your mind?

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.470 align:middle line:84%
If you were to ask your higher
guidance show me an animal

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'll-- and they're
just freaked out,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:84%
like how do I do this without
thinking about the right

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.197 align:middle line:90%
answer.

00:22:54.197 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll just have
this image or this experience

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:90%
pop in their mind.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And we use numbers but it's just
this beginning infrastructure

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:84%
of trusting something beyond
that small percentage,

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:84%
beyond cognition,
beyond linearity.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Like it's just this
freedom of uncharted space.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you move into
brain bypass, I mean,

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.720 align:middle line:84%
you can ask really high
calibrated questions

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:84%
for yourself or
other people, and you

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
receive this kind
of light language

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
or this metaphoric feedback that
you can learn to decipher it.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us a
couple more techniques

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that you use that you think
are super effective right

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:90%
now with individuals.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask you some
overarching questions that one

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:84%
would ask a psychic
and say, how come this?

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Sure.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think returning back
to the present moment, that is

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:90%
such a difficult thing to do.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know this from
experience because somehow

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:84%
through my psychic
development I knew

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.830 align:middle line:84%
that I had to be super present
because psychic information

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:90%
only comes in the now.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: The
future doesn't exist,

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:84%
past doesn't exist
in the way that--

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.182 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
only comes in the now.

00:24:06.182 --> 00:24:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Only
right now, exactly.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So if we're evading
that, how will we

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:90%
ever get out of this pickle?

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So I noticed even in following
the beautiful teachings

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.720 align:middle line:84%
of Eckhart Tolle,
every time I would

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
try to be in the now it
took me like three seconds

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and I was lost in
conversation with someone

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:84%
or chasing another
psychic squirrel.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So I developed this technique
that kind of combines the now

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:90%
and mindfulness.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
sandwich meditation.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I call it that is
because I was directed early

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
on in my psychic career
to take a sandwich

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and eat it very, very
slow, which I thought

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:90%
was a radical ask.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that, I remember
thinking this is excruciating.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the seeds on the bun
felt like furniture sliders

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:84%
on my teeth, and the
lettuce was gummy,

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:84%
it was quite an
awful experience.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
But within just a few
moments of being present,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I noticed electricity kind
of flowing through the air

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:90%
almost like a mirage.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.405 align:middle line:90%
I could hear the birds outside.

00:25:09.405 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Like you would just--

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just starting
to bring birds up.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: --turns it up.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It was just like a hyper
state or a superhuman

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Scared me to pieces.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, I think
it was just an unknown.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:90%
It was just my body was buzzing.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:29.590 align:middle line:84%
It was almost an electrified
way of being human.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.090 align:middle line:90%
It was just so out there.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you-- it
sounds like you were simply

00:25:33.215 --> 00:25:35.750 align:middle line:84%
tapping into the electrical
universe in which we live

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and you were consciously
aware of that transmission.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Exactly.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes, 100%.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was in
touch with the now.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And for me and for
a lot of us, it's

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:84%
those transmissions
of those guidelines

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:90%
of where we're supposed to be.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So the technique
that I would give

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
would be to try this
method to anywhere

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:90%
where you're very unconscious.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
For me apparently,
it was eating but you

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
can do it washing the dishes,
you can do it while driving.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So you take about 30 seconds
to a minute, no longer.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We want to retrain
that automatic response

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.890 align:middle line:90%
part of the brain.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And for instance, if
you're taking the dish,

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:84%
set a timer on your
phone, 30 seconds

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and feel the weight of
the dish in your hand

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and just take a moment
to breathe and feel that.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.787 align:middle line:84%
Flip it over, where was it
made, might surprise you.

00:26:26.787 --> 00:26:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably
China but go ahead.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Probably China you
know, smell the dish liquid,

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:84%
hear the water hitting
the basin of the sink.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And so essentially,
you're practicing

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
imploring all of those senses
and allowing them to go up

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:90%
into heightened psychic states.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you enter in
and out of those psychic states

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:84%
or that present now, the more
comfortable that you'll become

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and the less your brain's
going to fight you as you

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.770 align:middle line:90%
move outside of that box.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's one of
the more helpful techniques

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.203 align:middle line:84%
and you can do it
while you're taking--

00:27:01.203 --> 00:27:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --no matter
what you're doing.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or watching birds.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love to watch birds.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Perfect.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.933 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just so
absorbed into watching

00:27:08.933 --> 00:27:12.588 align:middle line:84%
their interactions and hierarchy
with each other and so forth.

00:27:12.588 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, anyway, it
doesn't matter what it is.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.838 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It doesn't matter.

00:27:15.838 --> 00:27:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Brushing your
teeth, feeling the bristles.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So to bring yourself
into the moment

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:90%
with in very simple ways.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until you
start developing

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.298 align:middle line:84%
essentially a knowingness
of what it feels

00:27:27.298 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:90%
like to be in the moment.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Absolutely.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that you don't shut down
or go into that fight or flight

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.333 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:27:33.333 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think the only
other thing that it

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:84%
would be such a great
beginning if one was trying

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to enter into that psychic
space is amplifying

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:90%
their personal frequency.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.372 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
methods on how to do this.

00:27:45.372 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:84%
But when I teach it,
it's all about how

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:90%
to get there the quickest.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We have busy lives, we sometimes
don't always have all the time

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:90%
to go meditate.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But what I've been
taught by my guides

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.520 align:middle line:84%
is that everything follows
the power of our intention

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.820 align:middle line:90%
and will.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can just even
in a 30-second timeframe,

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes and think up
or imagine what it would feel

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.070 align:middle line:90%
like to levitate.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I tell people just visualize
a thermometer or any kind

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:90%
of beacon to be lifted up.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is surprising
because it sounds so simple,

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.392 align:middle line:84%
and just count to 10 slowly
and just feel yourself.

00:28:23.392 --> 00:28:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Being lifted.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Being lifted.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're literally
changing dimensional quality.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you open your
eyes the light will

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:84%
be present in a different way,
you'll feel kind of spacey

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and heady, maybe a
buzzing but you've just

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.075 align:middle line:90%
left that dense swamp of the 3D.

00:28:41.075 --> 00:28:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
simple and wonderful.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for those.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Those are all very
useful techniques.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So getting into kind of some of
the general psychic questions

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.440 align:middle line:84%
people have because
people, first

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:84%
of all, predictive psychic
work is always dicey,

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.770 align:middle line:90%
timing is always dicey.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about that for a moment

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.560 align:middle line:84%
for all the brokenhearted
clients of psychics.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It didn't happen,
he didn't show up.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get the job.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:84%
When someone is
reading they're reading

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:84%
theoretically what is
transpiring and has

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.760 align:middle line:90%
developed in that moment.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So really it seems to me that
we're looking at probability.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So go ahead
and take it from there

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:90%
so people begin to understand.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I tell people
that I am an Akashic records

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.030 align:middle line:90%
reader.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.585 align:middle line:84%
And how that might be different
from a psychic reading,

00:29:34.585 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
although I think
psychic readings

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:84%
are so valuable for so
many different reasons.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But one of the obstacles
that one can run into

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:84%
is that when they're reading
someone or giving feedback

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.140 align:middle line:84%
about their life,
perhaps sometimes that

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.080 align:middle line:84%
can turn into forms of
mentalism or reading

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.010 align:middle line:84%
kind of just that life stream
that they're on currently.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
different options.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So in reading
someone I try to give

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:84%
this landscape of
all that they--

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:07.020 align:middle line:84%
the potentiality of their
soul of their spirit.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I try to really showcase
some things that are hard,

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
some fears, some
pain, some things that

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:84%
might be restrictive or
really give them a challenge.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I try to bring
to them their skill,

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.520 align:middle line:84%
their talent because
everybody has

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.080 align:middle line:84%
the potential for mastery in a
certain skill set or a talent.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we just
take those variables.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And we start to look
at it as a whole.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, here's your
highest potential, what are

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.270 align:middle line:90%
you willing to do to get there?

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So often when I go into work
with a client I'll say, look,

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.730 align:middle line:84%
this isn't going to
be fortune telling,

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be more like
extremely etheric strategizing

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:84%
We call in your
guides and angels.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So we really kind of create
this predictive focal point

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.270 align:middle line:84%
based on the opportunities
of choice that one has.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And so to surmise, it's
really this understanding

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:11.700 align:middle line:84%
between myself and my client
that if they make these shifts

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that these shifts
have to happen first,

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:18.660 align:middle line:84%
to prepare them to be calibrated
or aligned with those higher

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.590 align:middle line:90%
outcomes.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And often if we're
not willing to make

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.820 align:middle line:84%
those changes we'll never
see anything outside of that,

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:90%
that wheel

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's very
different than psychic readings

00:31:27.995 --> 00:31:28.950 align:middle line:90%
and Madame Zelda.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the other element
is time because one thing

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:37.890 align:middle line:84%
no matter how amazingly
elevated our guides are

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.710 align:middle line:84%
coming from other dimensions,
it doesn't matter.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:44.970 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that tends to
frustrate and stop humanity

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.140 align:middle line:90%
is time.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Because these things are going
to unfold in their own time

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and that can't be predicted.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.580 align:middle line:84%
One intervening thought
pattern from another person

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.620 align:middle line:90%
can change that timeline.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So talk about time as
you see it when you're

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.930 align:middle line:84%
looking at Akashic
records and when

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to relay things
to people without having

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.987 align:middle line:90%
them attached to a time frame.

00:32:08.987 --> 00:32:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So that's
a great question.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I think time and space
have a tighter relationship

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:90%
than maybe we understand yet.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And time obviously, we know
it's not a linear experience.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So often I tell people look,
we can't give timelines.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I can give this approximation
of an almost experientially

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.600 align:middle line:84%
dominoes falling if
you do this, then

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:90%
this will set you up for this.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or something can feel
closer, warmer, versus colder,

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think with that free
will it does skew timelines.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But I think what I've
noticed as a psychic,

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.740 align:middle line:84%
as an Akashic records, as
a student of the higher

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, it's less about
time and more about integration,

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:84%
more about walking
through the lessons

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that we need to learn
and not past them.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like there's a
spiritual bypassing that

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.030 align:middle line:84%
sometimes happens
or a quickening when

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:84%
people need that thing to
happen so that they can survive.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So that comes up in a
session pretty quickly

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:20.310 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying to have this
relationship come to fruition

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.520 align:middle line:84%
or this job change
because we need it

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.460 align:middle line:84%
so that we can not capsize
in anxiety and depression.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So we need to work on
those fundamental things

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and just as soon as you do,
it seems to expedite time.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so it's a lot of--

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.982 align:middle line:84%
I think it's bigger
than we understand.

00:33:38.982 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
the whole notion

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.660 align:middle line:84%
you talked about a
moment ago, and this

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.120 align:middle line:84%
is as we wind up
the conversation,

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.530 align:middle line:84%
the notion of our desire and
our will and our intention.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So often people come to a
psychic reading say, well,

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to be doing.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know my guides have
always said to people

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.190 align:middle line:90%
what do you want to do?

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do?

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And but what am
I supposed to do?

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And so talk about
that little dynamic

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:84%
on how important it
is for us to simply

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.140 align:middle line:90%
have a sense of what we want.

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's
part of this path of returning

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:84%
to the heart, returning
to our authentic self,

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.719 align:middle line:90%
and to know our spiritual edge.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.330 align:middle line:10%
It's not-- obviously,
it's not easy

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.639 align:middle line:10%
and I feel like I run
into people going well,

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't feel good so
it must not be right.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:31.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, oh, that's
never the case.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.909 align:middle line:10%
So I feel like where we are
right now is to become lucid,

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:10%
to become aware, to be
willing to take the shadow

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:10%
aspects of ourselves and look
at it and not run from it,

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:47.520 align:middle line:10%
and to hold our inherent
power without being

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:10%
ashamed or chalking
it up to ego,

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:10%
and allowing this great
return of all the pieces

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:10%
that we've ever
been to come home

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.670 align:middle line:10%
and living again in this
uniquely whole position.

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's going
to be the shift of the ages.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I think the Earth takes a
massive turn for the better

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.852 align:middle line:90%
if we could do that.

00:35:06.852 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you and I do

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:90%
see it turning for the better.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Absolutely.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm
sure you do as well.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Bonni, Thank you so much.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Thank you.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's just
really delightful

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.250 align:middle line:10%
to hear how you worked
with your own life

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:21.043 align:middle line:10%
and used all of what seems
like tragedy to your advantage

00:35:21.043 --> 00:35:22.710 align:middle line:10%
and also to help you
have compassion for

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.690 align:middle line:10%
and understand the
journey of another.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Absolutely.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.327 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And help them
understand themselves.

00:35:27.327 --> 00:35:29.097 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: 100% that's
what it's about.

00:35:29.097 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for having me.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Bonni.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.810 align:middle line:10%
Bonni's book is titled
"The Other Side of Normal."

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:36.880 align:middle line:84%
