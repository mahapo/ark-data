00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SARAH BRESKMAN: A client
could come in and literally

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.250 align:middle line:84%
heal themselves with
just one session.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And she went back to her
team of specialists and they

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.277 align:middle line:90%
said that there was no--

00:00:18.277 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
There was no trace.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Yeah, there
was no trace of it

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.545 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't understand
how that was possible.

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a medical miracle.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So I regressed her to
go back to the time

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:84%
when she was in a
mental hospital.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:84%
In our first regression, her
higher self, her subconscious,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:84%
said that she needed to find
out all this information,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
just share it with
the world, because it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:84%
was so important for us to
find out this information.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:90%
We need it desperately.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
When they escaped they,
were cold and hungry

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and they hadn't had that type
of experience on their planet

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: She understood that
the crash itself, all of this

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:10%
was intended.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I've often said that it will
be our collective memory that

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:84%
will piece together the story
of Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Toward that end, Sarah
Breskman inadvertently

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
dove into the
subconscious memory

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
of a client seeking
hypnotherapy right to the bottom

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
What they both learned as
chronicled in her book,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:84%
"A Hypnotist's
Journey to Atlantis",

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's a wonderful
adventure story.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And it also is
wonderful, because it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:84%
starts touching on things
other people have recalled.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not just this one person.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.762 align:middle line:84%
But this one person was
such a wonderful client

00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to work with because
of the clarity

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:84%
of what they could access
that you really focused on it.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:90%
So welcome, Sarah.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is wonderful.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we want to
talk about your background

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit, because
you were in Dolores Cannon's

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
School of Hypnotherapy, which is
very specific in its protocols

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and especially about
accessing deeper regression

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:90%
work and past life memory.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And I personally had one.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I had a regression done,
a past life regression,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:90%
done by Dolores myself.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So I understand a
little bit about what

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
you chose to educate
yourself along the line of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:90%
and I really appreciate it.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about why hypnotism

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and why Dolores Cannon's
protocols and body of work?

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN: Well,
I started out just

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:10%
as a person a regular person
with just a lot of problems.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:10%
And that led me to
traditional therapy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And in therapy, I thought
it was very helpful,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:90%
but I just didn't feel healed.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was nice, but
that led me to go to college.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to
become a psychologist.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:90%
So I chose psychology.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And after I graduated,
I got an internship

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
where my job was
basically to counsel

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and take care of
mentally ill patients.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And as I was working
there, it didn't

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
take me long to feel as if
everything I learned, for me,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:90%
was a lie.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I really wanted
to help these people.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:84%
That's always been my
goal is to help others.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't feel as if
anybody ever got better.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there
were many suicides

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and many people that
just suffered greatly

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:90%
from taking all the medications.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:90%
And these were amazing people.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people were actually
speaking with aliens or angels

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and they were just
so heavily medicated.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to figure out
some way to help people.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And I became a hypnotist.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And I first started
out with lose weight,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.765 align:middle line:90%
quit smoking in past life--

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:34.598 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The usual.

00:03:34.598 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Yeah, in past
life regression hypnotherapy.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't take
me long to realize

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
about the past life regression

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:90%
sessions.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
A client could come in and
literally heal themselves

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:90%
with just one session.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I delved into that more
and I studied with Dr. Brian

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Weiss in New York.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:90%
And I loved his method.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I did that for quite a while
and then I found Dolores Cannon.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And once I found her work,
I was immediately hooked.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Something in me
clicked when I started

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:84%
studying with that method
and I worked my way up

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:84%
to become a level three
QHHT practitioner,

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:90%
which is a master in that field.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And before the quarantine,
I was traveling

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.670 align:middle line:84%
all over the world with
Dolores's daughter Julia

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and I was assisting
in the classes.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.907 align:middle line:90%
And that is how I got here.

00:04:30.907 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And someone told
me about your book.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Someone in my own
little community,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.195 align:middle line:84%
ourneighborhood.earth,
he came in and said, oh--

00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:84%
because we all have open
dialogue with each other--

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I read
this book by this woman.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:84%
It's really
interesting, because it

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
has to do with a
memory of Atlantis.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And this person knew I have
an interest in Atlantis.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I also had a little hypnotherapy
clinic years ago and, like you,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
started out with
smoking, weight loss.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Didn't really
enjoy that as much,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:84%
but I loved the regression work
and past life regression work.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.170 align:middle line:90%
And like you.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying to validate
you and from my perspective,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I found that's where all the
really good where it came from

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:84%
was going in and looking at
these underlying patterns that

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:90%
were hidden from view.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.133 align:middle line:84%
So I respect very
much what you do.

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Thank you.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
wonderful about you too

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
is that you weren't oriented
toward the metaphysical

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of studying
esoteric, ancient,

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and alternative history.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
You didn't really know
anything about Atlantis.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't your bailiwick.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when all these
stories started emerging,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.260 align:middle line:90%
they were fresh and new to you.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:90%
And you thought, what is this?

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
innocence about you

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that really makes, for me,
this story most interesting.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine that
with the innocence and lack

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
of that previous knowledge
of your client Jen,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:84%
here you have two
people that have never--

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:84%
don't know anything
about this history,

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
haven't even been
curious about it,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:84%
bringing through all this
interesting information.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
preface it with that.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
Jen for a moment--

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:84%
because that's
interesting in itself--

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.113 align:middle line:90%
before we dive into the story.

00:06:13.113 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: So it
was fascinating,

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
because Jen had no
knowledge of Dolores Cannon

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
or any knowledge of
Atlantis or Lemuria.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that that would
make her an excellent candidate

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:84%
for this, because it
brings a lot of validity

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:90%
to this information.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But I was put on the
spot, because I really

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.300 align:middle line:84%
needed a subject to
regress for my level

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:84%
three class that was all of a
sudden going to be in Orlando.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So I had to find
somebody I could

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
regress and videotape to bring
this submission to this class.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why I chose Jen,

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
because she was a
teacher at the school

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and I knew she wasn't
into any of this stuff.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:90%
And I just asked her.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:84%
It was as if a thought
just popped into my mind

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and I just went
with that thought.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But little did I know
we were completely

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
set up by the universe
to do this work together.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
amazing, because I was

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
nervous of what she was going
to say when I told her--

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
when I asked her if she would
do this session with me,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
because it had a lot to do with
past lives, and going inwards,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and finding out who you
are, and things like that.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, you
can even heal your body

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:90%
if you have any issues.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But I was so
surprised, because she

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:84%
said she had been looking
for something like this,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.610 align:middle line:84%
because she hadn't told anyone,
but she had a brain condition.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And she was very
secretive about it.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It was this brain condition
called pseudotumor cerebri.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it mimicked
a tumor and the spinal fluid

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:90%
was wreaking havoc on her brain.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was causing things like
severe headaches and lethargy.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was even a
high risk of stroke.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And so she was
working very closely

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
with a team of specialists
at the University of Miami.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And they told her
there's no cure for this,

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.510 align:middle line:84%
but we can put you on
this heavy-duty string

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:90%
of pharmaceuticals.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Basically, that was all
they could do for her.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So she was very eager to
do this session with me.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.263 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once you said this can
work with physical conditions.

00:08:21.263 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: And after
the first session,

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:90%
she was completely healed.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, right after
she left my office,

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
she didn't take any
more medication.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And she went back to her
team of specialists and they

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.580 align:middle line:90%
said that there was no--

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.739 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't understand--

00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There was no trace.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: --how that was--
yeah, there was no trace of it.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.755 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't understand
how that was possible.

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:90%
It was a medical miracle.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, or not.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: I know.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now let's go
into when you and Jen first

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
began doing your
sessions and she

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:84%
went into a past life that
was in recent history,

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:90%
very recent history.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:90%
How old is she now?

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:90%
She's in her 30s?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: She's 35.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this was
in recent history

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
where she was trying to
understand some things

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and talking about
things that were not

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:90%
accepted to talk about, right?

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go ahead and
share the rest of that story

00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and where it landed her.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: So in
her regression,

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:84%
in her first regression,
she went to this past life

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
where she was
living in the '70s.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And she was learning
about different things

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
through hypnosis,
actually, where

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:84%
she was uncovering this lifetime
that she lived in Lemuria

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and she was a
prisoner in Atlantis.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
So she was she
grew up in Lemuria

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and then became a prisoner
for 60 years in Atlantis.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that past
lifetime in the '70s,

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
she started to share
this information.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:84%
She was called crazy,
lobotomized, and eventually

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:90%
jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now she
did not consciously

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:84%
remember any of that
in this lifetime.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:90%
That was all blocked.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it did not
take her somewhere

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:90%
she'd want to go again.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:90%
So she blocked it from herself.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Now you later went back in
thinking, who were you, Jen?

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you see where this
happened, where you were?

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And you did a little
more detailed work.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And tell us what you found.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: So I regressed
her to go back to the time

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
when she was in
the mental hospital

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and retrace her steps as she's
leaving the mental hospital.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And I had her turn
around and look

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
for a sign on the
mental hospital.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And at first, she said it was
very blurry, but she focused in

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:90%
and she saw the sign Bellevue.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And then she retraced her
steps to the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed she was
running in bare feet

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:90%
and it was in walkable distance.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So later, we googled
it to try to see--

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because she
didn't know about Bellevue.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:90%
It's been closed a long time.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:90%
A horrid history, but yeah.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Yeah.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:84%
We found out there was a mental
hospital called Bellevue.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It was in walking distance
to the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And also, one more
thing, we found out

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:90%
that it closed in the '80s.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I believe it has a
different name now.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But all of this just brought
so much more validity

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.092 align:middle line:90%
to the whole story.

00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and we
were talking off camera.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.425 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it'd be great if you
could get into public archives

00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and find out if
anyone jumped off

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
the bridge to their death
that has escaped from there.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the point is
you have that now, which

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
is fascinating, because
you guys are both young

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and you don't necessarily
know the history of Bellevue.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:90%
And she certainly doesn't.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:90%
She's even younger.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So again, this kind of memory
validating what's to come.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: We found out it
was 1978, five years before she

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:90%
was born in this life.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is not uncommon
from my understanding

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:84%
when someone dies a death that's
tragic, untimely, suicide,

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, they'll come
back into an incarnation.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Or a young person who's
lost their life and more

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:84%
will often come back pretty
quickly into a new incarnation.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't wait out the normal
time you do when you're 95

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and die and you
need a little rest.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:90%
So she came back again then in--

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.297 align:middle line:90%
what was her birthday? '80?

00:12:16.297 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: I don't
know her birthday.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
left in '78 you said?

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
OK and you said she came back
roughly five years later.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, good, so around early '80s.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So now you start getting
into the deep work

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:90%
of the Lemurian/Atlantean part.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And your story is going to
come in too, because you

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.540 align:middle line:84%
were regressed back into a
very pertinent life in Atlantis

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:90%
to what she was witnessing.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.853 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
start with Lemuria,

00:12:43.853 --> 00:12:46.992 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of crazy
considering who she was.

00:12:46.992 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: It was so
fascinating for the both of us,

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't know that
much about Lemuria or Atlantis.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
she was regressed

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
to find out that she was
a princess in Lemuria.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually called
Aman by the people there.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:90%
But she grew up as a princess.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Her mother was the
queen, the ruler.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And she was destined to
become queen after her mother.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.432 align:middle line:84%
And then visitors
started showing up.

00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that gets
into the Atlantean part.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.765 align:middle line:90%
You know what I want to do?

00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
if we can do this.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
The part prior to that when
she first came to Earth,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:90%
she was not from here.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:90%
That I found really fascinating.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It was just--

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: So
fascinating, Because

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.560 align:middle line:84%
in our first regression, her
higher self, her subconscious,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:84%
said that she needed to find
out all this information,

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
just share it with
the world, because it

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:84%
was so important for us
as a human collective

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:90%
to find out this information.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
We need it desperately.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to start
from the beginning

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
when we decided
to work together.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So I told her subconscious,
let's start from the beginning,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of the story
that you want to start telling.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And we both thought
she was going

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to go to her
childhood in Lemuria,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:84%
but instead she went
to a different lifetime

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
as an extraterrestrial coming to
Earth for the very first time.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
the story begins.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was interesting,
because the people here were

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
not as highly
developed at the time

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and were living in tribal
primitive kinds of patterns.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And she was a he,
head of the crew.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And the crew
stranded here, right?

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lost their mojo.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Lost all desire to really live.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't see how they
were going to get anything

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:90%
done in the new environment.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But he continued on and actually
connected with the locals.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And tell the story from there.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Sure.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:90%
So they were stranded.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Their ship crashed into
the side of a mountain.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was underneath the
water as well and they swam up.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:90%
A few of them died.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And when they escaped,
they were cold and hungry.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And they hadn't had that type
of experience on their planet

00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But they did know how
to escape their ship,

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.430 align:middle line:84%
because they had practiced
that once before.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But they had no knowledge that
this would happen to them.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And now after,
looking back at it,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:84%
she realized it was
all planned that way.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, that they met a
human and they begged for help

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And the human gave
them food and shelter.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And Jen, who was a
commander in that lifetime,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:84%
developed a
relationship with her,

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
because he knew that the
reason he there was basically

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:84%
to further their experiment,
to connect with the humans,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:90%
to start a colonization.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And once he connected
with her, they eventually

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:90%
developed a relationship.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up having
one successful child.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
she had five births

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and they all died except one.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And he was banished
by this time,

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:84%
because the cultures were
clearly quite different.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And she went back
with her own people,

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:90%
but did raise that one child.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was challenging for
the child, as I recall,

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
because they were a
hybrid being, basically.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:90%
That child was considered ugly.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.900 align:middle line:90%
But it was the start of so much.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.760 align:middle line:84%
It was the start of that
hybridization process.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that was her piece of
this story of the beginning.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that I note
there that's interesting

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
is she said that she understood
that the crash itself, all

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:90%
of this, was intended.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Now the 20th anniversary of
the disclosure event on UFOs

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:90%
took place relatively recently.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And in that, one
of those subjects

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that keeps coming
up in questions

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:90%
is, why do these crash?

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Could it be it's for intention?

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they're still
debating that in that circle.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And she knows nothing
of this, but that's

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.173 align:middle line:84%
what she came up with was
that this was for intention.

00:16:52.173 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Yeah, and
there were so many

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
crashes all over the
world, strategically.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Strategically.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
lot of hybridization

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.968 align:middle line:90%
that started at that time.

00:17:02.968 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: What I
found really fascinating

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:84%
was what was going on
in Antarctica, because I

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
had so many other clients
regress to Antarctica where

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:84%
they started this
colonization and they

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
started growing things like
humans, and plants, and stuff.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And they had to abandon
their post there,

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.993 align:middle line:90%
because disease snuck in.

00:17:24.993 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
going to come up again

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:84%
in the conversation,
the disease part.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you
look at the Piri Reis

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.130 align:middle line:84%
map, and everybody pretty
much knows that Antarctica

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.870 align:middle line:90%
used to be verdant green.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
It was hospitable once
upon a time, just not now.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you're
getting these stories.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
stories that start

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.170 align:middle line:84%
coming in from other people
that don't know anything

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
that are giving pixels of their
experience in the same place.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's
what I like is

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.293 align:middle line:84%
to start seeing people having
similar remembrances then

00:17:53.293 --> 00:17:54.710 align:middle line:84%
those are the
little vector points

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:84%
we start paying attention to
and then more start coming in.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:90%
So now we can go--

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:90%
he died.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:90%
That child lived on.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So now here she is in Lemuria
and it's a matriarchal society.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's continue on with
what happened in that lifetime

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:90%
to her.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Sure.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a
matriarchal society,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
because women held
knowledge within them.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they knew what
plants were OK to eat

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:90%
and what plants would kill you.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
important knowledge

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that was passed through the
subconscious from the mother

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:90%
to daughter.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
reasons why the women were

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.862 align:middle line:90%
in charge in that society.

00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And her
mother had died, right?

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Yes, her mother
was killed when the visitors

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:90%
started showing up.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain the
visitors and how she saw them.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: So she
saw them as people

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that look completely
different and super advanced.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
They were traveling in
these travel spheres

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
where they used a
stealth technology.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:90%
They were from Atlantis.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And they were using these--

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:84%
all my clients describe it the
same way-- these travel spheres

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:90%
that could float.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.800 align:middle line:84%
They had large fans
underneath them

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that use this type of
conductivity with magnets.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And it would suck in energy
and then propel the vehicle.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
They used propulsion
all the time.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they were traveling
in these travel spheres.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And when they came,
they said that they

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
were part of this
prophecy, this legend

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that everybody in Lemuria
had learned about,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:90%
the legend of the two sisters.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was what they said
when they first arrived.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking for help,
because they had a virus that

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:90%
was plaguing their community.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It was killing a lot of people.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So they came to Lemuria
with this problem.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And were
they basically

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
conning the locals with this
two sisters story, prophecy?

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:90%
It was a con.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: It was.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
was something else

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.860 align:middle line:84%
that Jen talked about and that
was a certain type of crystal

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that was being used in Lemuria
for a myriad of purposes.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Share that.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: So the Lemurians
had these red crystals that

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:90%
would help them keep immunity.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And they would have issues
like old age and animals,

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.210 align:middle line:84%
if they attacked
or pain, whatever.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trauma.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
die of illnesses,

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.020 align:middle line:84%
because they had a
special immunity that

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
was given to them with
these red crystals.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But the Atlanteans didn't know
how to use the red crystals.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them have
been taken away from them.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they knew that
the Lemurians had

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:84%
some sort of special
power and they really

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:90%
wanted to find out what it was.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So they had been studying
the Lemurians for a long time

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.220 align:middle line:84%
before they made
themselves known.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
made themselves known.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I understand
it, her mother

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:84%
had passed because
of these invaders.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:90%
She was killed.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So Jen really only had a
very short amount of time

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
where she was in any position
to have any say in society

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:90%
before she was taken.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Yes.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So they said they
wanted the crystals.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:84%
They got angry after a while and
they killed the mother and then

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Jen refused, of course.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And they acted like they
were just about to give up

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:23.860 align:middle line:90%
and they left.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is when the
wave came that destroyed

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
the whole civilization
of Lemuria.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she was
taken out before that.

00:21:32.865 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is really important,
because this comes up

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of your clients
and a lot of people at large

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.370 align:middle line:90%
have this terror.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't even want
to hear about tsunamis.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:84%
They're terrified of drowning
on a subconscious level

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:90%
and don't know why.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And you have a hypothesis
that part of it

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:84%
is from these ancient
traumas that we've

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:84%
experienced collectively in
these mass extinction events.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she did not live
through that mass extinction.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:84%
She did not live
through the tsunami,

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.640 align:middle line:90%
because they'd taken her out.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But she was made to
continually watch it.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: They made her
watch it over and over again.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
part of her torture.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So she was a prisoner in
Atlantis for over 60 years.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.465 align:middle line:84%
And part of her torture was to
watch it over and over again.

00:22:23.465 --> 00:22:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because she had a
little daughter, as I recall.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.382 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: She had
a little daughter

00:22:27.382 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
that was killed in the flood
and in the wave, by the wave.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But they would also do
things where they would

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.470 align:middle line:90%
bring in slaves from Atlantis.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And they would fill
this area with water

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
raise her up and make

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.910 align:middle line:90%
her watch them kill the slaves.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So they did a lot
of torturous things

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to her to try to get her
to break, to tell them

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.840 align:middle line:84%
how to use the red crystals,
and to tell them how

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.620 align:middle line:90%
they could have this immunity.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There were a
couple of things going on

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:84%
in addition to that and
we'll get back to that.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
There were also--
she noticed that they

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:84%
were doing experiments
with certain kind

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:90%
of hybridized creatures.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And many people who have
studied ancient Atlantis

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
have heard these
tales of the hybrids,

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:84%
of the creatures that later
maybe became known as gods,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Pan-like creatures and such.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about her
observations of Atlantean life,

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:84%
including of these creatures,
but her general observations

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.638 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantean life when
she arrived there.

00:23:31.638 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Well,
obviously, she was biased

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't like
them very much.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:84%
But she found them to
be very cold people that

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:84%
were very scientific and
into their technology.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed, as well
as many of my other clients

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
noticed, the hybridization
that they were doing

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:90%
and the experiments.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons for the
issues with these animal people

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.680 align:middle line:84%
was they developed a
vaccine, because they

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
needed to eradicate this virus
that was killing off everybody.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:90%
But it was different than now.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.610 align:middle line:90%
They didn't use a needle.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:84%
They would cut a slit in
the arm and put this vaccine

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:84%
into the person and
then cover it up

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:90%
with this putty-like material.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:10%
But they gave this
vaccine to everyone

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.950 align:middle line:10%
and it was animal-derived.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.140 align:middle line:90%
It had animal DNA.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some of it was cat?

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Yes,
it had feline DNA,

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:90%
all different types of DNA.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But they needed to do
this so they could give it

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:90%
to so many people.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
they're experimenting

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:84%
to see which was more
effective, more compatible

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:90%
with human beings.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the nature of what
she saw as the virus itself,

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.610 align:middle line:84%
how that virus and illness was
affecting the civilization.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: It was killing
off a lot of their population

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
until they developed
this vaccine.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And they were burning
the bodies everywhere

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and that's why
many of my clients

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
describe this smog when they
would regress to Atlantis.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And she even described
this smog as well.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
But that was from the
bodies being burned.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're saying
that some of the mutations

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
or mutants occurred because
of the vaccine itself,

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:84%
because it was using animal
DNA and it was causing problems

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:84%
in future generations
who survived?

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: It wasn't the people
that received the vaccine.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And at first, it looked
like this huge success.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it stopped
this virus and everybody was

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:90%
so excited.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't
until the first set

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:84%
of babies started being born
with these devastating side

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.960 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
There were babies being
born with missing limbs

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:90%
or they had animal parts.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And that didn't seem
to be such a big deal

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:84%
until the babies grew up
and started causing violence

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.450 align:middle line:84%
or they had all different
kinds of issues.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They weren't
fitting in with society.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: And they
weren't fitting in.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now this becomes
a really interesting part

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.180 align:middle line:90%
in the story.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So now you're among
hypnotherapist,

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.870 align:middle line:90%
because that's what you do.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:90%
You go to conferences.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:14.910 align:middle line:90%
You regress people.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:84%
You were also going
through training

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:84%
at one point for these
higher master levels.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So at one point,
you were regressed

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and you went back into
the situation in Atlantis

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
that was contending with how to
deal fairly with the mutants.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So tell us who you were,
what you experienced,

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and what you finally
came to realize.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: I didn't know
that I had a part in the story

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:90%
at all until I was regressed.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I was helping Julia Cannon,
Dolores Cannon's daughter,

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:90%
in Miami.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And as part of the
class, somebody

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:84%
was regressing me
to practice on me.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a past life at
Atlantis where I was a judge.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And my job was basically to sort
through thousands and thousands

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.613 align:middle line:84%
of cases and figure out who
could stay and who could go.

00:27:05.613 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Among the mutants?

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Among the mutants.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.697 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because some were more
able to live alongside society,

00:27:10.697 --> 00:27:11.497 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:11.497 --> 00:27:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: The ones that
were violent or were causing

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:84%
destructive behavior,
I was told that they

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:84%
would go to this island
where there was a facility

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and they would be given
help and things like that.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't know
was that that was a lie.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:84%
They were really
being all murdered.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you eventually
with two other people who

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:84%
were in this capacity
went to this island.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your experience,

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
because this was all
the big reveal to you,

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't even
know you were going here.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: So I
decided that I really

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.470 align:middle line:84%
wanted to see this
island, because we

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:52.500 align:middle line:84%
had sent thousands and thousands
of mutated children and adults

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:84%
to this island
where we were told

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.410 align:middle line:90%
they were given a better life.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to see
where all these people went.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there,
there were no people.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:90%
There was just dust.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I'm doing
this regression in front

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:90%
of the whole class in Miami.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And people are coughing
in the audience.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
They're coughing
and they're sobbing,

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:90%
because they were there.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this while
I was being regressed.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that
they were all murdered.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And this regression
wasn't just for me.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.150 align:middle line:84%
It was a group regression,
as we later found out.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So now you you've
come to realize

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that you were being
lied to the entire time

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and you know what's
happening to the bodies.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you go back?

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Did your regression go--

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember if
it went beyond that

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:84%
where you returned to the
land and told your findings.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Well,
we all went back

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and we wanted to help as
many people as we could

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and to stop this.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But I was pretty much so
devastated that my heart gave

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.440 align:middle line:90%
out and I had a heart attack.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
why I'm here again,

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.840 align:middle line:84%
just to shed light
into what happened

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and try to help these
people once again.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now
what about Jen?

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So now let's pick back
up where her story--

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.530 align:middle line:90%
it hasn't ended yet.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's pick back
up with her story.

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: So as she
was a prisoner in there,

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.900 align:middle line:84%
they did so many different
experiments on her

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and she witnessed
everything going on.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And she was given a
helper and this helper

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.960 align:middle line:84%
was somebody that
she knew she could

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.460 align:middle line:90%
pass this information onto.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And that helper was to retain
those records, so to speak?

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And ultimately, she did die.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:90%
She died.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:84%
They gave her tiny bits of
freedom, but not really.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.540 align:middle line:84%
They always had an eye on
her and controlled her.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: But what she
did see during her few walks

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:84%
during the day was just
this beautiful city.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis was amazing.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And they had different moats
that they use for their water

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:90%
filtration system.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.810 align:middle line:84%
It was really interesting
how they used--

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like a
triple osmosis filter.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And they would
propel the salt out

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.650 align:middle line:84%
so they would have
the salt on one side

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and then freshwater
on the other side--

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Early
desalination units.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And different
flying vessels where

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.920 align:middle line:84%
they use propulsion,
and magnets,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and different
conductivity agents.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And so she was really
fascinated with it,

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:84%
almost like a guilty awe
when she would walk around

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.030 align:middle line:90%
the city during the day.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But she
never really got

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to have contact with
the ordinary citizens.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.408 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: She didn't.

00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She just
stayed in with those

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:90%
who were policing her.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So her feelings, of course,
are very, very negative

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:84%
about who the Atlanteans
were, because she was

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.360 align:middle line:90%
exposed to nothing but cruelty.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's where you almost
have to then pick up

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:84%
with other people
who lived in Atlantis

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.730 align:middle line:84%
elsewhere or at other times
to start piecing together

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:90%
the rest.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.437 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
have other clients.

00:31:06.437 --> 00:31:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Now there's one man
I want to get back

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
to who quickly regressed
into that scene

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.307 align:middle line:90%
where he's in Atlantis.

00:31:14.307 --> 00:31:15.640 align:middle line:90%
And he's saying, I don't get it.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.290 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was--

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:90%
where all the blue skies?

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was smoky.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:84%
The air was smoky
and smelt fetid.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So he regressed
to this time where

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:29.530 align:middle line:84%
he knew it was very advanced,
but it looked ancient

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:30.330 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And we did not know he
was in Atlantis at all.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But he was in quarantine,
because there was a virus that

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:90%
was plaguing the city.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And he was more afraid of
the dictator, the leader,

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.230 align:middle line:90%
than of this virus.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
fascinating, because I've

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.360 align:middle line:84%
had other clients
regress to that time

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.215 align:middle line:90%
and explain the virus.

00:31:50.215 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
remembered the smell

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:84%
in the air from the bodies
being burned and such.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So now you and
Jen decided you're

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.660 align:middle line:90%
going to continue on this.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
book you wrote.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And now you're continuing
to do regressions

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.790 align:middle line:90%
into the times of Atlantis.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Are you going into Lemuria
too or mostly Atlantis now?

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Mostly Atlantis.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about some of the interest--

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:90%
this book is in the making--

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about some of the
new information coming forward.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: We've really been
learning about other planets

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and about how other planets go
through their Ice Age, which

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:30.040 align:middle line:84%
led to us looking more into
the Ice Age on this planet.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And what we learned was there's
so many underground tunnels

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.130 align:middle line:84%
where it housed a lot
of people, hybrids,

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.880 align:middle line:90%
during the time of the Ice Age.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
It's really fascinating
just what people

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.420 align:middle line:90%
had to do back in those days.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And we've also been learning
more about Mount Shasta,

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and the people in Mount
Shasta, and Telos, and Thoth.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:56.713 align:middle line:84%
Thoth, he has really been
coming up a lot more recently.

00:32:56.713 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go into
some detail about each

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.005 align:middle line:84%
of these, since it's going to be
a while before the book's out.

00:33:01.005 --> 00:33:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: I know.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of
all, the notion of--

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.575 align:middle line:84%
yeah, because
you're getting this

00:33:05.575 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:84%
from different clients
that don't know each other.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with ice
ages and the tunnel system.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I assume it's constructed
so people can connect

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.100 align:middle line:84%
with one another and
whatever supplies

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.845 align:middle line:90%
are for survival are needed.

00:33:19.845 --> 00:33:20.970 align:middle line:90%
So it has to be a certain--

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.520 align:middle line:90%


00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:84%
the species has to have
certain features to be

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:90%
able to survive underground.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: They definitely did.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It was mostly for
the hybrid beings,

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.060 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't want them
to perish during this time.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.060 align:middle line:84%
The Ice Age was needed,
because the Earth really

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.210 align:middle line:84%
need a cooling off,
because it was just

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.030 align:middle line:84%
a time where they
really-- the Earth itself

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:49.830 align:middle line:84%
really needed to cool down
and to start over, to rebuild.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And it took thousands of years.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, this
happens periodically.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:55.463 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: It does.

00:33:55.463 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:90%
And even on other planets.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.068 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: And what's
really fascinating

00:33:59.068 --> 00:34:02.460 align:middle line:84%
is when other clients go
to these other planets,

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.470 align:middle line:84%
they can find the
same technology

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:90%
in the same cities as Atlantis.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So you can tell
that Atlantis was

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:14.639 align:middle line:84%
built as a replica almost
of these other civilizations

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.689 align:middle line:84%
on other planets, which
is really fascinating.

00:34:16.689 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:84%
And in the work of
some people, it's

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:84%
been said that there are as many
as 400,000 human civilizations

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:90%
throughout the cosmos.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Oh, I
wouldn't doubt it.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
this human form

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:32.159 align:middle line:84%
is the most preferred form
because of its functionality.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In just furthering
that, each of these species

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:40.530 align:middle line:84%
then has to essentially adapt
to the environment they're in,

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.780 align:middle line:84%
adapt to whatever the
chemical structure

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and atmospheric structure of
whatever planet they're on.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:49.409 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, whether it's
tall, whether it's short,

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.570 align:middle line:84%
whether it's pale,
whether it's dark,

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:55.800 align:middle line:84%
it's still the humanoid
form, supposedly,

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.540 align:middle line:90%
throughout the cosmos.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Yes.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one thing I
remember that my own soul

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:84%
tribe told me one
time is they said,

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.760 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking
at all these anomalies

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and wondering how
all this happened,

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.930 align:middle line:84%
instead of being so
confused over it,

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:84%
if you can understand one
thing, it would be very helpful.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
there has always

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.050 align:middle line:84%
been air travel since the
beginning of your time,

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:84%
because other beings
from other places that

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.380 align:middle line:84%
have these technologies
have always been there.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's always been easy to
move groups of people around,

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.980 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move artifacts
and materials and such around,

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:84%
that it's always been possible,
because there's always

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:90%
been these technologies.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Yes.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've been told that
it's really important for us

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.910 align:middle line:84%
as humans to finally understand
who we are and why we're here.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And who we really are is
we're all ancient groupings

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of beings that have traveled
from planet to planet

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.570 align:middle line:84%
to find out what the next
and the next will be.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And to really go inwards and
realize that we're not alone,

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're these
powerful beings,

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and we're here for
the experience.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And every experience that
we have benefits everyone.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So just give us
a little bit more

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.640 align:middle line:84%
of what you and
Jen are uncovering

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.550 align:middle line:84%
as a tease for the next
time we get together.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Oh my gosh, so much.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.510 align:middle line:84%
We're also finding out more
about the New Earth and just

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:25.740 align:middle line:90%
the ascension process.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the New Earth a bit.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: OK, this
is really fascinating.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many clients that
are women that have already--

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.060 align:middle line:90%
they're post-menopausal.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And they come into
have sessions with me,

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.410 align:middle line:84%
because they feel
pregnant and they don't

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.970 align:middle line:90%
understand what's going on.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And in their sessions,
they find out

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that they are indeed pregnant,
pregnant with hybrid beings

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.850 align:middle line:90%
that are seeding this New Earth.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Because, as beings, we've all
been going from one planet

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.590 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.300 align:middle line:90%
We need a backup planet.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.560 align:middle line:90%
We always do.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's another back
planet in the making.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is what people
call the New Earth.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I will say this.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I just did a private grouping,
a discussion, on this recently.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the same thing
that my beings told us

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.767 align:middle line:90%
about 40 years ago.

00:37:14.767 --> 00:37:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Oh, wow.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They did.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:84%
They said there is a second
Earth that has already

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.430 align:middle line:90%
been prepared for these times.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And so not to look at
it with any form of kind

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.355 align:middle line:90%
of hierarchy or judgment.

00:37:27.355 --> 00:37:29.730 align:middle line:84%
It's that there would come a
time where the consciousness

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.650 align:middle line:84%
would split to the
extent where we

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.390 align:middle line:84%
would need two
environments to continue

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.760 align:middle line:90%
developing in our own way.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.540 align:middle line:90%
So you're now seeing this too.

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Right.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.835 align:middle line:84%
And not just with Jen,
with so many other clients.

00:37:40.835 --> 00:37:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Please,
talk about this

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and what they've had to
say through their lenses.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: So what I've
have found from sessions

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.930 align:middle line:84%
is that there's two different
situations going on.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.740 align:middle line:84%
There's some people that will
literally move from this Earth

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.090 align:middle line:90%
to that New Earth.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there's some people
that will literally create

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.830 align:middle line:90%
a New Earth on this planet.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:08.255 align:middle line:84%
So it's really what your soul
chose before you incarnated.

00:38:08.255 --> 00:38:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:14.810 align:middle line:84%
One time I looked into that,
I just did a deep meditation.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I said, show me if
there's something to see.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.560 align:middle line:90%
What is the New Earth like?

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
in that while it was

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.840 align:middle line:90%
newer in that it did not have--

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:84%
certainly didn't have any
kind of modern structures

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.140 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And it did not have
any modern technology.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:84%
It had the same kind
of human technology

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:84%
that we all carry
with us and it had

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:38.880 align:middle line:84%
people who understood how to
create homes and communities

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.810 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:84%
But there was no
modern technology.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And I found that interesting,
because it was down to just

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.353 align:middle line:84%
working on ourselves and our
connection with one another.

00:38:51.353 --> 00:38:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: That's
funny, because no one

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.645 align:middle line:84%
has mentioned the
technology on the New Earth.

00:38:55.645 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't see any.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: That's
really fascinating.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know Hank
Wesselman-- bless his soul--

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:02.860 align:middle line:90%
he has passed on recently.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.537 align:middle line:84%
Hank Wesselman went
into the future

00:39:04.537 --> 00:39:05.620 align:middle line:90%
and it was the same thing.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.320 align:middle line:84%
He did not see-- there
was no technology.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Now his was the future glimpse
of, he thought, this Earth.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's very interesting when
you go into these other realms,

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.600 align:middle line:84%
it is hard-- and this isn't
making an excuse for what he

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.310 align:middle line:90%
saw, I saw, or anyone else saw--

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.530 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, when you
detach from this realm

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and go into that other
part of your mind

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that is more a part of
all, it is very hard

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.450 align:middle line:84%
to determine where
exactly you are.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:36.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why in regressions,
it's so hard to say, gee, where

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.900 align:middle line:90%
am I living or what is my name?

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.210 align:middle line:84%
That part's hard
to come up with.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I find it myself having been in
regressions that part's hard.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:45.637 align:middle line:84%
But you can kind of explain
what you're engaging with,

00:39:45.637 --> 00:39:47.470 align:middle line:84%
what it looks like, how
people are behaving,

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:48.730 align:middle line:90%
and what they're saying.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that a little bit.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Names are hard
to get, because you really

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.640 align:middle line:84%
aren't using that part of your
mind when you're in regression.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So even Dolores Cannon said
that names were hard to get.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.040 align:middle line:84%
I can get the names sometimes
through the subconscious.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, a name
will come to the client

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.760 align:middle line:84%
after they wake
up in the morning.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's a known fact that it's
hard to get during regression.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And I used to feel terrible
about it, thinking, god, why am

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:15.820 align:middle line:90%
I hiding the name from myself?

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:90%
I could not get names.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And when it came to the end
times of one phase of Atlantis,

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.970 align:middle line:84%
as you know, Dolores
Cannon did regress

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:27.730 align:middle line:84%
me and I'm in her book,
"Convoluted Universe Two".

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Forgotten the page, but
it's the television lady

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:90%
that she speaks of.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And it goes on quite a bit in
detail about the loss of life

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:84%
at that time and
the loss of our will

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to continue to live and
repopulate the planet

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.520 align:middle line:84%
if we had the memory of
what had just happened.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So speak to that a
little bit, because I

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.350 align:middle line:84%
think you and Jen are bumping
into these other destruction

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:51.340 align:middle line:90%
periods too.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: She went
to that time period

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and tried to find out
more information about it.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like
it was so devastating

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:84%
for the people involved, because
it really set humanity back

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.480 align:middle line:90%
quite a long way.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It did.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think
it's in the book.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Dolores captured it.

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I was saying.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:16.880 align:middle line:84%
By this time, I was
crying and I said,

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.020 align:middle line:84%
we've somehow ruined our
relationship to the sun.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.240 align:middle line:84%
The matrix of the
delicate energy

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.580 align:middle line:84%
built between the Earth and
the sun has been ruined.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to sleep
for a very long time.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.900 align:middle line:90%
And she said, to sleep?

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, all of us.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And when she asked why, I said,
because if we do remember what

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:37.240 align:middle line:84%
we've just lost, which
we lost everything,

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.300 align:middle line:84%
we blasted ourselves back to
the Stone Ages, so to speak--

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.650 align:middle line:90%
that's a whole other story--

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:45.040 align:middle line:84%
but we would not have any
incentive to reincarnate.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
too long to rebuild,

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.782 align:middle line:90%
to remember, reconnect again.

00:41:50.782 --> 00:41:52.240 align:middle line:84%
It was just going
to take too long.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.907 align:middle line:84%
It would be very
discouraging on a soul.

00:41:53.907 --> 00:41:55.720 align:middle line:90%
So our memories were wiped.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: What's really
fascinating about this time

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're living
in is the knowledge

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and information has
come up to the surface.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: And you can even
tell through regression,

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:84%
because even back when
Dolores was doing this work,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
most of her clients would
be completely unconscious.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, because the
brain has evolved so much,

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:84%
the information and
all this knowledge

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.200 align:middle line:90%
is right at the surface.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.300 align:middle line:90%
We can go further into it.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And what people
don't seem to realize

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.210 align:middle line:84%
is that they feel less
unconscious these days

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:32.110 align:middle line:84%
during these sessions,
because their brain

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:84%
has evolved so that
they are almost

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:34.980 align:middle line:90%
becoming their higher selves.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.030 align:middle line:90%
It's super exciting.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that is.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: The
knowledge is here now.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:42.245 align:middle line:84%
It's acceptable and we can
find out so much these days.

00:42:42.245 --> 00:42:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.287 align:middle line:90%
You're in a unique position.

00:42:44.287 --> 00:42:45.560 align:middle line:90%
You have a lot of clients.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting these
reflections from all around.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.990 align:middle line:90%
So what would you say--

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.030 align:middle line:84%
we just have a minute
or two left-- what would

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:55.540 align:middle line:84%
you say are the kind of
top two or three patterns

00:42:55.540 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:84%
of information that is
validating one another coming

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:90%
in right now?

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN: Well, I would
say that we are not alone

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:07.610 align:middle line:10%
in our memories of recounting
our times in Atlantis

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:08.410 align:middle line:10%
and Lemuria.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:11.500 align:middle line:10%
We're all back here again
thousands and thousands

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.560 align:middle line:10%
of years later, because
the time is right for us

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.220 align:middle line:10%
to release this stored trauma
within our minds and our soul.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's easy to do that now.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.190 align:middle line:90%
It's acceptable.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We can connect
with other people.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And we can really heal
as a collective now.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Anything else besides our
Lemurian and Atlantean roots

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.045 align:middle line:90%
together coming up?

00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:36.118 align:middle line:90%
Well, like you said, ice ages.

00:43:36.118 --> 00:43:38.410 align:middle line:84%
The fact that people have
been on other planets, that's

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:39.210 align:middle line:90%
also coming up.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.418 align:middle line:84%
Any other thing or shall we
leave it at that for now?

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:43.627 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN: Oh my gosh,
everything is so fascinating.

00:43:43.627 --> 00:43:45.050 align:middle line:90%
I just want to know everything.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:46.527 align:middle line:84%
But there's just
too much to say.

00:43:46.527 --> 00:43:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know there is.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:48.080 align:middle line:90%
I know there is.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And we decided we were going
to confine this conversation

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.040 align:middle line:90%
to this story.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But your new book will be
out before too terribly long

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have you
back on the show.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Thank you.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Sarah.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.925 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for doing
a lovely work you do.

00:43:58.925 --> 00:44:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And thank Jen for
us as well for being

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:03.680 align:middle line:84%
willing to go deep into
some really, really

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.210 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortable stuff.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It was pure torture
for her, a lot of it.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.080 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate that.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN: Thank you.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, Sarah's book
is titled "A Hypnotist's Journey

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:17.190 align:middle line:84%
to Atlantis", a chronicling of
Jen's regression and others.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:21.263 align:middle line:84%
You can also reach out to Sarah
at theholistichypnotist.com.

00:44:21.263 --> 00:44:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.270 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds".
