>> Regina Meredith: Some of
you may already have had calls

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.765 align:middle line:84%
from friends or family
member shocked over the news

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.901 align:middle line:84%
that their healthcare insurance
plan had been canceled.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:38.138 align:middle line:84%
According to President Obama,
this was not supposed to happen.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.174 align:middle line:84%
But then, many issues that are
surrounding Obamacare were not

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.442 align:middle line:90%
supposed to happen.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.278 align:middle line:84%
It's such a mess that the
average person has no idea

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
what's going on and
little success

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.183 align:middle line:84%
in accessing the
healthcare.gov website.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.285 align:middle line:84%
To help us navigate
these murky waters,

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:55.021 align:middle line:84%
I brought in Dr. Carlos Santo,
a Naturopathic Physician

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.523 align:middle line:90%
of 16 years who feels

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.826 align:middle line:84%
that Obamacare has been
made deliberately confusing

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.729 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to also show us
options as to how we can proceed

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.232 align:middle line:90%
in managing our own healthcare.

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.234 align:middle line:84%
It's feeling more and
more to me, Carlos,

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.502 align:middle line:90%
like we're on our own.

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:10.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Carlos Santo: Very
much so, Regina, yes.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.505 align:middle line:90%
That is the case.

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:14.341 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing this on a
regular basis with my patients.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.009 align:middle line:90%

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.545 align:middle line:84%

being dropped off entirely

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.616 align:middle line:90%

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:23.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What are
the stats right now?

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:25.118 align:middle line:90%
It's only been a few weeks in.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know it's
in the millions.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.288 align:middle line:90%
I know people.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.791 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, right before the
show, one of our people here

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:34.628 align:middle line:84%
on the production team
said that this is just--

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.496 align:middle line:84%
a friend of theirs
had just been canceled

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.665 align:middle line:84%
after having the same
plans since 1986.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:39.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yeah.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And have
kids and everything.

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:42.202 align:middle line:90%
No more plan.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.436 align:middle line:90%
So, it's in the millions.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.838 align:middle line:90%

It's very, very unfortunate.

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:52.112 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly how
many are losing but it's a lot

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:90%
and it's happening everyday.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, and it's happening
at a much greater level

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.918 align:middle line:84%
than there are people
who were able

00:01:57.918 --> 00:02:00.053 align:middle line:84%
to access the website
last month.

>> Regina: I mean, as
tragic as it is, I mean,

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:05.192 align:middle line:84%
maybe the one good bit
of news is that it's so--

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:07.993 align:middle line:90%
the website is so dysfunctional.

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:10.664 align:middle line:84%
Some few people can
access it and get anywhere

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:11.832 align:middle line:90%
but the numbers are what?

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:13.166 align:middle line:90%
One percent.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.202 align:middle line:84%
There were two who have starting
October signed up X number

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:17.871 align:middle line:84%
of people, right, to
make the system a go.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.973 align:middle line:84%
And they're under one
percent of that level?

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: The original
numbers they were hoping for

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:25.078 align:middle line:84%
and expecting were around
half a million people signed

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.278 align:middle line:90%
up the first month.

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:28.515 align:middle line:84%

are going on hopeful.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:29.583 align:middle line:90%

thinking, "Oh good.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.318 align:middle line:90%

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:32.586 align:middle line:84%
Oh good. I have preexisting
condition,

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be taken care of."

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.256 align:middle line:84%
It's turning out to
be anything but that.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.359 align:middle line:84%
And they have every right
to be expecting these things

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.694 align:middle line:84%
because these are
the things, well--

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.462 align:middle line:90%
I mean except it's politics.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.464 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
we were told about.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yeah.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Why don't we take
a look at clip number one, OK?

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yeah.

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:49.769 align:middle line:84%

take a look at a little bit

of archival footage from 2009
when Obama had black hair.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.909 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Obamacare has put
a lot of grey in there.

the glories of the plans.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.947 align:middle line:84%

at clip number one.

[ Silence ]

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Barack Obama:
Here are the details

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:17.063 align:middle line:84%
that every American needs
to know about this plan.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
First, if you are among
the hundreds of millions

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.203 align:middle line:84%
of Americans who already
have health insurance,

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.706 align:middle line:84%
nothing in this plan will
require you or your employer

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.209 align:middle line:84%
to change the coverage
or the doctor you have.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.378 align:middle line:84%
Under this plan, it
will be against the law

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
for insurance companies
to deny you coverage

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.781 align:middle line:84%
because of a preexisting
condition.

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.117 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I sign this bill,
it will be against the law

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:42.055 align:middle line:84%
for insurance companies to drop
your coverage when you get sick

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:45.191 align:middle line:84%
or water it down when
you need it the most.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.761 align:middle line:84%
They will no longer be able
to place some arbitrary cap

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.262 align:middle line:84%
on the amount of
coverage you can receive

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.132 align:middle line:84%
in a given year or
in a lifetime.

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:54.801 align:middle line:84%
We will place a limit on
how much you can be charged

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.936 align:middle line:84%
for out-of-pocket expenses,
because in the United States

00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:84%
of America, no one should go
broke because they get sick.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.543 align:middle line:84%
And insurance companies
will be required to cover,

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:07.147 align:middle line:84%
with no extra charge, routine
checkups and preventive care,

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:09.316 align:middle line:84%
like mammograms and
colonoscopies

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:12.619 align:middle line:84%
because there's no reason we
shouldn't be catching diseases

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:16.055 align:middle line:84%
like breast cancer and colon
cancer before they get worse.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.958 align:middle line:84%
If you lose your job
or you change your job,

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.960 align:middle line:90%
you'll be able to get coverage.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.164 align:middle line:84%
It is strike out on your own
and start a small business,

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:26.499 align:middle line:90%
you'll be able to get coverage.

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.602 align:middle line:84%
We'll do this by creating
a new insurance exchange,

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.571 align:middle line:90%
a marketplace where individuals

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.673 align:middle line:84%
and small businesses
will be able to shop

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.608 align:middle line:84%
for health insurance
at competitive prices.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.311 align:middle line:84%
Now, for those individuals
and small businesses

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:42.015 align:middle line:84%
who still can't afford the
lower-priced insurance available

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.651 align:middle line:84%
in the exchange, we'll
provide tax credits,

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
the size of which will
be based on your need.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.323 align:middle line:84%
For those Americans who
can't get insurance today

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.592 align:middle line:84%
because they have
preexisting medical conditions,

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:55.295 align:middle line:84%
we will immediately
offer low-cost coverage

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.931 align:middle line:84%
that will protect you
against financial ruin

00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:59.699 align:middle line:90%
if you become seriously ill.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.167 align:middle line:90%
This was a good idea

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:04.537 align:middle line:84%
when Senator John McCain
proposed it in the campaign.

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:08.875 align:middle line:84%
It's a good idea now, and
we should all embrace it.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
But an additional
step we can take

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.746 align:middle line:84%
to keep insurance
companies honest is

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:15.482 align:middle line:84%
by making a not-for-profit
public option available

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.449 align:middle line:90%
in the insurance exchange.

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.051 align:middle line:90%
Let me be clear.

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:22.188 align:middle line:84%
It would only be an option for
those who don't have insurance.

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:25.992 align:middle line:84%
No one would be forced to choose
it, and would also keep pressure

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.828 align:middle line:84%
on private insurers to keep
their policies affordable

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.631 align:middle line:84%
and treat their customers
better.

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:32.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow.

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:90%
That sounds wonderful.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.201 align:middle line:90%
So, it was--

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:35.902 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: We don't
have enough time.

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:37.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh my God.

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:38.338 align:middle line:84%
I know we don't have enough time
to adjust each of those issues.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.672 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: I'm going to be nice.

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I know that
you're not biased politically.

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.042 align:middle line:90%
I already know that about you.

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Absolutely not.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You're a pragmatist
who spends a tremendous amount

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:49.516 align:middle line:84%
of time looking after your
patients whether they pay you

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.283 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:51.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: That's correct.

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:52.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, you're
in the spirit of this.

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:53.119 align:middle line:90%
You're in the spirit

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:54.954 align:middle line:84%
of proactive preventative
healthcare.

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:55.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:57.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, in
addition to that,

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.324 align:middle line:84%
you've done a tremendous
amount of research

00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:59.626 align:middle line:90%
because you had to on Obamacare.

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:00.794 align:middle line:90%
Let's get in to it.

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:02.695 align:middle line:84%
That first thing he
said, "You will not have

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.831 align:middle line:84%
to relinquish your
current healthcare plan."

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:07.066 align:middle line:84%
Yet, millions of people
are receiving this

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:08.268 align:middle line:90%
cancellation notices.

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:11.438 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that,
why that is not true.

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:15.008 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I have a paper here
on what he just said last week.

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:18.645 align:middle line:90%
He said, let me read that quote.

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:20.747 align:middle line:90%
What actually he said, he said--

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
he said, "What we said
was you could keep it

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.087 align:middle line:84%
if your plan has not changed
since the law was passed."

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: We'll, if he
said that back in 2009--

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: He didn't.

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:31.757 align:middle line:90%
We just saw what he said.

00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:33.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: He wouldn't have--

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:35.128 align:middle line:84%
he would never have gotten
this bill passed, you see?

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.696 align:middle line:90%
So, he had to say what he said.

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:39.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, let's talk
about what all of this means.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Well--

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The fine
print, all of it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: That is the truth.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:45.972 align:middle line:84%
And had he said the
full truth about it,

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.474 align:middle line:84%
this would not have
gotten passed.

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:50.143 align:middle line:84%
Now, people were asking,
"Did he lie or not?"

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.544 align:middle line:90%
I'm not concerned about that.

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:55.281 align:middle line:84%
What I'm-- Whether if he'd lied
or whether he misinformed people

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:84%
because he himself chose
not to read the bill,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.386 align:middle line:84%
I'm equally concerned, I would,
because this is our leader.

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:03.156 align:middle line:84%
We should have been
better informed himself

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.324 align:middle line:90%
and told us the truth.

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:05.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You know,
this is a big deception--

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:06.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:06.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- whether
it was intentional

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.027 align:middle line:90%
or not, huge deception.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:08.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: It's still
deception and, you know,

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:10.063 align:middle line:90%
whether it's him or, you know,

00:07:10.063 --> 00:07:11.564 align:middle line:84%
the other powers it'd
be, I don't know.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:12.665 align:middle line:90%
In that front, they don't care.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:15.168 align:middle line:84%
But I'm all about
solutions, you know?

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:17.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's look at
the reality of what happened.

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.105 align:middle line:90%
What was the fine print on it?

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:22.275 align:middle line:84%
And what were people not
getting when they heard that?

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: The big thing is
if your coverage changes,

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:28.014 align:middle line:84%
one iota since the inception of
the plan back in March of '10,

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:30.717 align:middle line:84%
so that's two and
a half years now.

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Then now, you're
automatically disqualified

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.989 align:middle line:90%
from keeping your plan, period.

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:36.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: All of us?

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Anyone who changed their plan--

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Anyone.

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: In the last--

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:40.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And whether
you changed it

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.261 align:middle line:84%
or whether your provider
changed,

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:42.629 align:middle line:90%
or your company changed.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:46.199 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if your deductible
changed in a slightest bit,

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.101 align:middle line:84%
one aspect of your
coverage may have changed.

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:51.037 align:middle line:84%
Another, frankly,
on our annual basis,

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:53.873 align:middle line:84%
every plan renews
whether we know it or not.

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:56.743 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our premium may not
change or a plan does renew.

00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:58.111 align:middle line:90%
And when it renews--

00:07:58.111 --> 00:07:58.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so, we may not
even know what changes there

00:07:58.945 --> 00:07:59.712 align:middle line:90%
and there--

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:00.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: That's correct.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:01.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- if it's
under an employer?

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:02.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Especially
does it on employer.

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:04.017 align:middle line:90%
You're not in control of that.

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.118 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunate--

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:06.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you don't
know until people--

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: We get a letter.

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:08.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- like friend--
until you get a letter?

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:09.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
It happened to numerous
patients of mine.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.027 align:middle line:84%
It happened to my sister
and go with so many details.

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.094 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:15.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And this
happened to a number

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:16.563 align:middle line:90%
of people I know as well.

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:17.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Absolutely.

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:18.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And it's still--

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:18.798 align:middle line:84%
we're still only
a month into it.

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:19.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:20.633 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:21.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But you-- You've told
me off camera that we can more

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:26.339 align:middle line:84%
or less expect to at least
40 to 50 percent in order

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.709 align:middle line:84%
for this plan to work
economically must be canceled

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.045 align:middle line:84%
and shunted over into the
government-backed program.

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: To afford
the plan and--

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.847 align:middle line:84%
or to meet a lot
of plans when it

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
in fact take effect
a certain number

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.618 align:middle line:84%
of Americans even
those who's especially

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
who are covered currently
and paying out-of-pocket

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.421 align:middle line:90%
for their care have to go

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:45.225 align:middle line:84%
onto the government plan
before it's even get funded.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:46.526 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't work otherwise.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:50.563 align:middle line:84%
So, on average, about 39,000
people per day would have

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:52.098 align:middle line:90%
to have gone and continue to go

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:55.702 align:middle line:84%
through the healthcare.gov
website.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And from March-- from
October 1st until March 1st

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:03.276 align:middle line:84%
of '14 to actually see this
through in its entirety.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:04.978 align:middle line:84%
And as I said right
now, we're at less

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:07.513 align:middle line:84%
than 50,000 signed
up after, you know--

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:08.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: A month.

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.649 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: It's a
little over a month now.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:13.519 align:middle line:84%
So, the numbers are not
looking good for them

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.321 align:middle line:90%
to implement the plan.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:19.859 align:middle line:84%
Looking a lot better for the
people to have more time before

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:22.895 align:middle line:84%
which the fines start to
accrue and we start to have

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:26.299 align:middle line:84%
to make a choice, either we get
on to the single-payer system

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:29.135 align:middle line:84%
or we accrue-- or
we accrue the fines.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: OK, now, let
me back up for a second.

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:33.906 align:middle line:84%
Of all these people you've heard
from and you've heard from a lot

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.375 align:middle line:84%
because you're a
healthcare provider.

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:36.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:40.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Have any of their
plans changed for the better?

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:42.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I can't see it
but it's too soon to tell.

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:44.484 align:middle line:84%
The promise is that the plans
are going to be better, right?

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:46.319 align:middle line:84%
That overall, costs
are going to be less.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Care is going to be better.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.756 align:middle line:84%
But I can't see it possibly how
when it looks like the payoffs

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.225 align:middle line:90%
to doctors are going to be less.

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:52.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:53.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: I don't see it.

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:54.961 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it.

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, and everyone
we've heard off so far, they--

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:58.731 align:middle line:90%
if they haven't been canceled

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:03.169 align:middle line:84%
and they have gotten their new
policy under the Obamacare plan

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.071 align:middle line:84%
which is still Humana,
Kaiser, it's all the same.

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It looks the same
as it did before.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.377 align:middle line:84%
Everyone I've heard from,
their premium has gone up

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:13.613 align:middle line:84%
and the deductible
has skyrocketed.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yeah.

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:15.248 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:16.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And a lot of
cases more than doubled,

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
gone from your ordinary
45,000 dollars

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:90%
to 12, 13, 14,000 dollars.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.754 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:22.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's
what I've heard.

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:23.156 align:middle line:90%
Have you been hearing the same?

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:23.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:24.824 align:middle line:90%
You can just look at it.

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.225 align:middle line:84%
It's right there
on the marketplace.

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:29.796 align:middle line:84%
You just go on a few on end, you
sort of realistic resemblance

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.298 align:middle line:84%
of your prior coverage from what
you are paying out-of-pocket for

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:35.601 align:middle line:84%
or something close to what
your monthly premium had been.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.603 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at a
minimum of double,

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:39.338 align:middle line:84%
if not triple, of
your deductible.

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:42.208 align:middle line:84%
That means what's deductible is
your out-of-pocket cost that's

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:44.777 align:middle line:90%
not covered by your insurer.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:45.611 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot.

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:46.779 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of gap to make up.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.114 align:middle line:90%
And people don't have that.

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so, for the
average family, they don't have

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:49.882 align:middle line:90%
that much in disposable--

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:50.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: No, no, no.

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:51.517 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- cash lying around.

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:52.585 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you put it on a--

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:53.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: That would
be back to anybody.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:55.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:56.689 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: So, this is
what we're dealing with.

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:57.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:58.725 align:middle line:90%
Let's back up a little bit.

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:00.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: OK.

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:03.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What was the original
rationale behind this Affordable

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:04.297 align:middle line:90%
Healthcare Act?

00:11:04.297 --> 00:11:06.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, the
biggest part of it

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's the part they
really don't talk about much

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.502 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- I
think it's delivered

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:90%
over side as a distraction.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
They keep talking about
this 40 plus million people.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.375 align:middle line:84%
The average-- The
specific number is just

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:21.114 align:middle line:84%
under 46 million uninsured, but
no one ever on any network wants

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:24.517 align:middle line:84%
to talk about or frankly of any
political party wants to talk

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.619 align:middle line:84%
about who these 46
million people are and how

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:29.889 align:middle line:84%
that number was ever, you
know, arrived through.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.057 align:middle line:90%
That's the big thing.

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:33.226 align:middle line:84%
And that's the big part
of the disinformation,

00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:34.193 align:middle line:90%
who these 46 million are.

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:35.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let's talk about it.

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:36.896 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the 46 million
people and how they're impacted.

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:37.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I would love
to because we need

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.698 align:middle line:90%
to get this information out.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:40.666 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for it.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:41.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, if we look at
the breakdown, and I got some

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:44.237 align:middle line:84%
of this info from the CNN
and MPR, and then some of it

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:46.139 align:middle line:90%
from Huff Post, you know?

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:48.107 align:middle line:90%
So, it's a lot of both sides.

00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:53.246 align:middle line:84%
But the common theme or threat
here is it's this 46 million,

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:54.881 align:middle line:90%
supposed people.

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:59.752 align:middle line:84%
A good-- 20 percent of
those people are the 20

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.954 align:middle line:84%
and 30 something who are
already of good health

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:02.989 align:middle line:90%
and these are the people

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
who were invincible
and we were there.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And we just chose
not to have coverage.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.494 align:middle line:90%
And of course this--

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:09.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So now,
they're forced

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:10.496 align:middle line:84%
to have coverage
but they take up--

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:11.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:12.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- very
little by way of services?

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:13.566 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Right.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that's a real
profit maker in the 20s and 30s?

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And then what we heard
here in the video segment was,

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.372 align:middle line:84%
you know, they're
calling it an option.

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:22.742 align:middle line:84%
And this is not an option
if you're forced onto it.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.178 align:middle line:84%
That's just a contradictory
statement.

00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:26.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, they
called it the public option.

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:27.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Option.

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:28.714 align:middle line:84%
And it's not an option
if you have to do it.

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:29.482 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And that's only

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.518 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have
healthcare insurance where--

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:33.653 align:middle line:90%
yeah, where is the choice?

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:34.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: So, if you--
yeah, there's no choice.

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:35.922 align:middle line:84%
And so, the freedom of
choice has been just ripped

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.989 align:middle line:90%
out from underneath us for the--

00:12:37.989 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
frankly, for the benefit
of a few, not for a lot.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, let
me get this straight.

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.263 align:middle line:84%
So, if you're taking
essentially what, 20 percent,

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:48.601 align:middle line:84%
you're taking 10, 15 million,
20 to 30-year old individuals

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.936 align:middle line:84%
who are already healthy
and who are not

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
in the system right now,
they're not paying--

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: They'd rather put
their money into the 401Ks.

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:54.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:55.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Or, you know,
aggressive funds that are going

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.009 align:middle line:90%
to give them good return or--

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Or even some
new technological gear,

00:12:59.045 --> 00:12:59.979 align:middle line:90%
things of their choice.

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Whatever
they want to do.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.849 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Then--

00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so, that money
is not in the healthcare system?

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.652 align:middle line:84%
So now, they're forced into
the system to pay into it?

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:08.054 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:13:08.054 --> 00:13:10.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And they're going to
be taking very little out by way

00:13:10.323 --> 00:13:12.024 align:middle line:84%
of care unless they
get an accident

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:12.992 align:middle line:90%
or something by and large?

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:14.393 align:middle line:90%
They don't use the system much.

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:16.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: That's well-- I'll get
to the risks that we take there.

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:17.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:18.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: You know,
coverable and et cetera.

00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:19.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:20.266 align:middle line:90%
Now, who were the other--

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:21.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: That's the
other part of them.

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:24.303 align:middle line:84%
While the other 20 or so
percent would be the illegals

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:27.039 align:middle line:90%
who are not currently covered.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And the large portion of
whom are undocumenteds.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.377 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:32.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: OK.

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:33.579 align:middle line:84%
So, the documented
illegals would be the ones

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:35.781 align:middle line:84%
who maybe got full
social security numbers.

00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:36.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Who are
actually are paying

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.384 align:middle line:84%
into the system through
taxation.

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:39.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And who are
receiving benefits to employers.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.521 align:middle line:84%
Well, so whether he
illegally or not, that's--

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:45.491 align:middle line:84%
they're still receiving
benefits and they'll actually--

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
they technically are
part of the insured.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.062 align:middle line:84%
But because they couldn't
participate in the census,

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:52.431 align:middle line:84%
you see that the numbers
tend to get thrown off

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:56.402 align:middle line:84%
and skewed quite easily
when we throw these numbers

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:90%
and we assume things.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.239 align:middle line:84%
And again, as I said, I
have a science background.

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:02.141 align:middle line:90%
I'm not just an alternative--

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:03.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.043 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- physician
and provider.

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:07.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I'm-- I always
backup what I say with fact

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:09.548 align:middle line:84%
and some type of
historical precedent.

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.918 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, our
politicians don't do that.

00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:13.886 align:middle line:84%
They don't hold themselves
to the same standards.

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:17.156 align:middle line:84%
So, the undocumented, so
the ones who were supposed

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:20.793 align:middle line:84%
to be benefiting from this
but they're expressly excluded

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:22.295 align:middle line:90%
from the Affordable Care Act.

00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:23.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now, OK, so
let's-- wait a minute.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:24.497 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: So, they're
not going to be--

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:25.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right now,
if you're undocumented--

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:26.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Taken care of.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Then-- And something
happens, you go to the ER.

00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:29.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yep.

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:30.336 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you have
to be taken cared of.

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Absolutely.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.238 align:middle line:90%
Care cannot be--

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:32.972 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There's no
hospital that can refuse you.

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:34.106 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: No.

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:35.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, they're
already taken cared of.

00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:36.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: That's
just one avenue.

00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The indigent

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.778 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds are
already taken cared of.

00:14:38.778 --> 00:14:40.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Everyone is already
taken cared of, absolutely.

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:42.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So what
happens under this?

00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:44.116 align:middle line:90%
How does it change?

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:46.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, we don't
know how it's going to change

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:48.621 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's going
get worse frankly.

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:51.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you can-- you're
still on an ethical moral issue,

00:14:51.524 --> 00:14:53.292 align:middle line:84%
you can't refuse
service to someone--

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:54.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: No.

00:14:54.694 --> 00:14:55.594 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- who's been banged
up and this arrives at the ER.

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:56.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Right.

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:84%
But, you now, you've got people
who were wanting an anonymity

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and maintain their-- and
so maintain their anonymity

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.437 align:middle line:84%
as undocumented and that's
certainly their option to do so.

00:15:04.437 --> 00:15:05.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Who may now for fear
of being forced on to some kind

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:12.445 align:middle line:84%
of plan may now even want to
seek care at least be looked

00:15:12.445 --> 00:15:14.814 align:middle line:90%
at the local urgent care.

00:15:14.814 --> 00:15:16.615 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because
they're now in the system

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:17.917 align:middle line:84%
and they're detected,
they could be deported.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, or be
forced into the system.

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:20.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:21.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: That's correct.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.455 align:middle line:84%
And worried about
being deported, yes.

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:26.292 align:middle line:84%
So again, I just don't see this
as beneficial to even those

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.627 align:middle line:84%
who are not documented
and who were--

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, clearly
not if it's excluding them.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I think it
was a convenient excuse

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
to get this plan forced
through to think we were going

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.267 align:middle line:90%
to just bring everybody in.

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:38.237 align:middle line:84%
Now, we still have 40
percent if we were to add up,

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:39.872 align:middle line:90%
well maybe 60 percent.

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:40.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:41.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: If I do
my numbers right.

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:42.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, 60 percent.

00:15:42.742 --> 00:15:43.676 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Forgive me
for the percentile.

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And we have to add
up to a hundred.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:46.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: A lot of math
does-- is magical math.

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.481 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'd like to use.

00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:50.416 align:middle line:84%
It usually goes to a hundred
when talking percents.

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:51.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:52.485 align:middle line:90%
So we got 60 percent less.

00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:54.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: The rest of the
people are the working class

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:56.922 align:middle line:84%
who perhaps might
just be above the--

00:15:56.922 --> 00:16:00.326 align:middle line:84%
or the poverty line but who
do not qualify for Medicaid

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:03.629 align:middle line:90%
which is state-run healthcare.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:08.901 align:middle line:84%
And that is a reasonable gripe
but there were so many ways to--

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:11.037 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hoping today we can get
the message out to those people.

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:12.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We will get--
we will get to that.

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:13.439 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:14.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: These-- There
are so many more answers

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.643 align:middle line:84%
than just pushing those people
onto the government's plans.

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.046 align:middle line:84%
Because these people are
mostly already covered

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:22.181 align:middle line:84%
but they'll tell
us that they're not

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:24.717 align:middle line:84%
or they're electing
perhaps minimal coverage

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:27.553 align:middle line:84%
because they want to take the
extra money they're saving

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:31.023 align:middle line:84%
and put it toward proactive
healthcare or taking care

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:32.391 align:middle line:90%
of their families and otherwise.

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:34.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Or just-- yeah, or
just feeding their families.

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:35.327 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Feeding
their families.

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So, we do have answers for
them and I do believe again

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.533 align:middle line:84%
that this information up
there has been keeping

00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:41.767 align:middle line:84%
that information
away from people.

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:43.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It was primarily
on their backs though

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:84%
that this law was
pushed through.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Not necessarily.

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:46.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That those-- I mean--

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:47.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: On the surface, yes.

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:48.707 align:middle line:90%
It was like that.

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:49.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, on the surface.

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.409 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: But that's not who
they wanted, they wanted.

00:16:51.077 --> 00:16:52.044 align:middle line:90%
They don't want it.

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:53.279 align:middle line:84%
And they're frankly
hurting them.

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.114 align:middle line:84%
You're hurting these people
by raising their taxes,

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:56.882 align:middle line:84%
pushing them onto
higher premiums

00:16:56.882 --> 00:17:00.052 align:middle line:84%
with much higher deductibles,
higher risk categories.

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:03.288 align:middle line:84%
And you're not even making
it easier for them to do it.

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:05.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And when-- this
was happening out of time

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:90%
and I can't disassociate

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.595 align:middle line:84%
from the larger background,
economic background.

00:17:10.595 --> 00:17:12.064 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time right now

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:17.036 align:middle line:84%
where this plan could cause
severe economic hardship

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.437 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.972 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for this government and
we already have a broken back.

00:17:20.972 --> 00:17:23.509 align:middle line:84%
We are already basically
living on air, you know,

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:25.643 align:middle line:84%
in terms of just
printing money freely.

00:17:25.643 --> 00:17:27.212 align:middle line:90%
But the average person,

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:30.082 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Andy
Hoffman last week

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:33.119 align:middle line:84%
and he said the real
numbers in unemployment,

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:35.554 align:middle line:84%
if you look at how it should
actually be calculated

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:38.657 align:middle line:84%
and not the phony numbers,
is closer to 25 percent.

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:40.693 align:middle line:84%
If that's true and
we have a nation

00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:46.098 align:middle line:84%
that has roughly 25 percent real
unemployment or underemployment,

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:49.969 align:middle line:84%
and then we're burdening
them with higher taxes

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:52.705 align:middle line:84%
and higher premiums for health
insurance if they had any

00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:90%
at all, what's that saying?

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.111 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how illogical and
ridiculous is that kind

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:01.847 align:middle line:84%
of a burden on the
average person?

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: It's heartbreaking.

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:05.551 align:middle line:84%
It's heartbreaking to ask
people to reach deeper

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:09.855 align:middle line:84%
into their pockets frankly for
just a fear-based perspective

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:12.591 align:middle line:84%
that it's just the
wrong direction to go.

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.927 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying the
system was perfect

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.896 align:middle line:84%
or it's currently
perfect the way it is,

00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:20.432 align:middle line:84%
but it is still the greatest
healthcare system in the world.

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:23.269 align:middle line:84%
And I can definitely say
that with conviction.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.738 align:middle line:84%
It was a nice-- I'm
practicing a long time

00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:30.009 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen what other
types of healthcare are like.

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:33.913 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at where the
premiers around the world go

00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:35.815 align:middle line:84%
or come I should say,
when they need their care,

00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:36.749 align:middle line:90%
they come to the United State.

00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's true.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.185 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: We have the
greatest technology

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:41.053 align:middle line:84%
and the greatest resources
and the most generous doctors,

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:43.022 align:middle line:90%
the most generous citizens.

00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:45.925 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- frankly, we are
the ones who were taking care

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:47.126 align:middle line:90%
of the underprivileged now.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.528 align:middle line:90%
No one is being denied care.

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:52.865 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're covered or not,
they're not being denied care.

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:55.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, at the same
time, you'll hear someone--

00:18:55.668 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll hear the argument
which, you know,

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.806 align:middle line:84%
at face value is
a good argument.

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:01.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Sounds great.

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:02.374 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:02.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That socialized
medicine.

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:04.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yeah.

00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:04.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Everybody
you pay into is based--

00:19:04.777 --> 00:19:06.245 align:middle line:90%
you base through taxes.

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.613 align:middle line:84%
But you don't-- that's
not a factor.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:08.948 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing you ever
have to worry about.

00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:10.249 align:middle line:90%
There's no out-of-pocket.

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:12.451 align:middle line:84%
You get sick, you break
a bone or whatever,

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.219 align:middle line:90%
you go to the hospital.

00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:90%
It's taken care of.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.089 align:middle line:84%
And so they would-- many
people would say, "Well,

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:20.159 align:middle line:84%
that sounds like a kinder system
than to be a low-income family

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.595 align:middle line:84%
who breaks a bone and
doesn't have insurance and has

00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:26.165 align:middle line:84%
to pay out-of-pocket, and
they're strapped with a 15,000

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:29.168 align:middle line:84%
or 25,000 dollar bill for
a couple of hospitals,

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:30.502 align:middle line:90%
stays in the hospital."

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:34.173 align:middle line:84%
And whatever it takes, X-rays
and drugs, and what not

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:37.776 align:middle line:84%
to who can back up with the cast
even, something that simple.

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:40.212 align:middle line:84%
So, how do you make
that argument?

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:42.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: We have
stopped that measures

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:45.351 align:middle line:84%
on the state-by-state
level, 50 percent funded

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:48.053 align:middle line:84%
by the federal government, 50
percent by the particular state.

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:50.522 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we have
a plan called "Access"

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.825 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially
a subset of Medicaid

00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:55.127 align:middle line:84%
or state-provided
healthcare, 50-50.

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:56.829 align:middle line:90%
And the most anyone ever pays

00:19:56.829 --> 00:20:00.132 align:middle line:84%
who can prove need is
at 30 dollar co-pay.

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's it.

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:02.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: A co-pay
essentially is what you--

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:06.639 align:middle line:84%
what your out-of-pocket cost
is for a particular visit.

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:07.873 align:middle line:90%
I had plenty of patients.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.975 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not an access
provider by law.

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I had plenty of patients
under the access system

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.049 align:middle line:90%
who did quite wonderfully on it.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.417 align:middle line:90%
I can give you examples,

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:84%
of a woman being allowed
three prenatal ultrasounds,

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.057 align:middle line:84%
RIT trimester of
her pregnancy free.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:27.326 align:middle line:84%
She's assigned an OB/GYN
physician who was there

00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:29.762 align:middle line:84%
at the time and, you know,
her labor and delivery,

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:31.764 align:middle line:90%
totally provided by the state.

00:20:31.764 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because that woman
essentially proved need.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.969 align:middle line:84%
They don't ask how much
money you have in the bank.

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:38.137 align:middle line:90%
They don't care where you live.

00:20:38.137 --> 00:20:39.405 align:middle line:90%
You can live on a golf course

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:42.875 align:middle line:84%
in the wealthiest section
of wherever you live.

00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:47.379 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is prove need
and be a resident of that state.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.881 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's
been in place how long?

00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:52.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: We've had it
for years, for years.

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:53.285 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with that system?

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:56.989 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that system
worked as well

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:59.358 align:middle line:84%
as we've seen urgent
cares taken cared of,

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:01.994 align:middle line:84%
not just the county hospitals
by the way, and same thing

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:04.496 align:middle line:84%
with access, privatized
hospitals

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:06.999 align:middle line:90%
in the best sections of Arizona.

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:09.001 align:middle line:90%
Providing care, they don't ask

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.703 align:middle line:84%
for an immigration
status or anything.

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:11.403 align:middle line:90%
Providing care.

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's true.

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Because the first
thing they see is a patient

00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:15.507 align:middle line:90%
in need.

00:21:15.507 --> 00:21:17.176 align:middle line:90%
And they're taken cared

00:21:17.176 --> 00:21:19.311 align:middle line:84%
of whether they have a social
security number or not.

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:21.547 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this over and over.

00:21:21.547 --> 00:21:24.049 align:middle line:84%
I can't understand what's
wrong with the system.

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:27.219 align:middle line:84%
Why we need to pump another
trillion dollars into something

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.755 align:middle line:84%
that we can't afford and it's
more than a trillion dollars

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
when in fact they
run all the costs

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.059 align:middle line:84%
and everything else is going
to go into this to pad--

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:36.595 align:middle line:84%
you know, frankly, certain
politician's pockets

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:39.031 align:middle line:84%
and highly especially
interested--

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:41.166 align:middle line:84%
especially interested
corporations

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:45.204 align:middle line:84%
who are directly benefiting
from plans like this.

00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:47.539 align:middle line:84%
It's not going into the
pockets of the people.

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:49.975 align:middle line:90%
It's actually coming out.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:52.711 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing
this on both sides

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:55.914 align:middle line:84%
of the political sort
of bent, if you will.

00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:59.017 align:middle line:84%
When you hit people deep enough
and hard enough in the pocket,

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:01.453 align:middle line:84%
they're going to start
to waken up-- awaken.

00:22:01.453 --> 00:22:03.922 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this is
what's happening right now.

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:06.558 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of peoples of
political affiliations

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:09.328 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing it frankly
even in the close-minded media

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:10.662 align:middle line:84%
because they are
hardly close-minded.

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:90%
They can tell you this.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to see all
of the, you know, the--

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Even FOX is putting--
FOX is putting some information

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.907 align:middle line:84%
out that's essentially not
supporting the status quo

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:22.908 align:middle line:90%
of Obamacare.

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:24.009 align:middle line:84%
I have another little
piece to read.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:24.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, FOX--
I'm seeing CNN.

00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:26.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:26.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And everyone
is coming out saying--

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:27.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.014 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- somebody
here step up--

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:30.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- and let's
make these rights.

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:32.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:33.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Because the way it
is right now, it's not right.

00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:36.422 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of egg on our
faces as a culture here or as

00:22:36.422 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:84%
to say as a society because
we should have the stuff

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.859 align:middle line:90%
down and we don't.

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: They're--

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:42.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And I'm so glad
to have this opportunity

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:44.563 align:middle line:84%
to be sharing this
here with you.

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:46.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh, I'm so glad
you are too 'cause I'm

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:47.332 align:middle line:90%
confused also.

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:49.101 align:middle line:84%
I'm just waiting for
my cancellation notice.

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:49.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: As am I.

00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:50.369 align:middle line:90%
I have coverage.

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: There you go.

00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:53.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And I don't
know how long I will--

00:22:53.005 --> 00:22:53.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I'm Kaiser.

00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:54.606 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:55.407 align:middle line:90%
What is-- which--

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:56.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: I have Humana.

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:56.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Humana?

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:57.676 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: 95 dollars a month.

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:04.917 align:middle line:84%
I have 7,500 dollar deductible
because I'm extremely low risk.

00:23:04.917 --> 00:23:06.652 align:middle line:84%
And why would I need
anything else?

00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:09.955 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the Cadillac plan.

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:12.157 align:middle line:84%
I don't have all the bells and
whistles that they're going

00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:14.893 align:middle line:90%
to require of me if I'm going

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:16.628 align:middle line:84%
to help participating
in the system.

00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:20.599 align:middle line:84%
So essentially my plan
will not work according

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:22.134 align:middle line:84%
to the standards of
pay they have set.

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:22.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:23.902 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is another part.

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.304 align:middle line:84%
It's not just if
you've changed your plan

00:23:25.304 --> 00:23:27.172 align:middle line:84%
or if your employer
has changed your plan.

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: That's right.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But if your plan
doesn't meet the new government

00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:34.713 align:middle line:84%
guidelines and let's talk
about how fair or absurd some

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:36.148 align:middle line:90%
of those guidelines are.

00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:37.683 align:middle line:90%
You were telling me off camera

00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:39.618 align:middle line:84%
when I was started
researching this--

00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:40.986 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yeah.

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:44.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- that men will
be required to carry prenatal

00:23:44.323 --> 00:23:46.325 align:middle line:90%
and OB/GYN for example.

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:47.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Women's healthcare.

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:47.593 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:48.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:23:48.961 --> 00:23:50.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Or maybe it ultimately
comes down to birth control.

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:52.831 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've always
know women to pay

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:53.765 align:middle line:90%
for their own birth control.

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.567 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's not expensive.

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:56.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: It's really
less than, you know,

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.406 align:middle line:84%
a few cups of Starbucks a month
and we can all drink less coffee

00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:02.574 align:middle line:84%
and be better off,
you know what I mean?

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:05.878 align:middle line:90%
So now, what does it look like?

00:24:05.878 --> 00:24:06.879 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:07.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: The premium
I pay is less

00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:08.947 align:middle line:90%
than half of my cellphone bill.

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.682 align:middle line:84%
I'm just, you know,
perspective spokes, you know?

00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:13.785 align:middle line:84%
It's like we say we can't
afford something but we have--

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:15.087 align:middle line:84%
we're not willing
to give up some

00:24:15.087 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:84%
of our other negative things
that we do or bad habits.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.893 align:middle line:84%
We say we can't afford things
and it's really a shame.

00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:23.629 align:middle line:90%
It's essentially prioritization.

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:24.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It is.

00:24:24.263 --> 00:24:25.264 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:26.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Like it
was so important.

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:28.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But now, what are you
going to be required to carry

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:29.134 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't before that
will ensure that you're going

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:30.536 align:middle line:84%
to willing to deliver
your cancellation?

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:31.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I really--
I really don't--

00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:34.540 align:middle line:84%
well, it doesn't matter because
once it's canceled, it's done.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.275 align:middle line:84%
There is no remedying
the situation.

00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:37.609 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of it.

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:38.944 align:middle line:90%
And I can't have it back.

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we
need to raise you.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.315 align:middle line:84%
Well, it could be like
they need to raise--

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.517 align:middle line:90%
we need to raise you to get you.

00:24:45.517 --> 00:24:48.554 align:middle line:90%
But frankly it's plan by plan

00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:49.588 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
a direct answer.

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:50.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:51.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: So, you're either
going to get canceled--

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:52.724 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:24:52.724 --> 00:24:53.959 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Or you're
going to get raised up.

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:55.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I don't know what
camp I'm going to be in but one

00:24:56.128 --> 00:24:56.795 align:middle line:90%
of those is going to happen.

00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:58.297 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say that.

00:24:58.297 --> 00:24:58.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:24:58.931 --> 00:24:59.898 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about--

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:00.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: 'Cause
both were happening.

00:25:00.566 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk
about preexisting.

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:05.003 align:middle line:84%
You pay 95 dollars a
month and if I were still

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:07.139 align:middle line:84%
on the plan I was
on-- which I changed

00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:08.907 align:middle line:84%
in the last year
and a half or so?

00:25:08.907 --> 00:25:12.444 align:middle line:84%
With Kaiser, I'd be at about 900
dollars a month individually--

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:13.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yeah.

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:14.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- because I have
a preexisting condition.

00:25:14.947 --> 00:25:16.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: That's right.

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:18.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so essentially,
it's, you know, I'm held hostage

00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to the most expensive
program and it doesn't matter,

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.889 align:middle line:90%
no one else will take me.

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:27.559 align:middle line:84%
So now, this was supposed to
really help and assist people

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:29.595 align:middle line:90%
like myself and there are a lot

00:25:29.595 --> 00:25:32.197 align:middle line:84%
of them. Now what they are
doing is broadening out the--

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:34.199 align:middle line:84%
what they did a few
years ago, is broaden

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:36.868 align:middle line:90%
out the preexisting status.

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.804 align:middle line:84%
So many, many people
were denied--

00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:39.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:40.639 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- or paid this
horrid price and we're having

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.076 align:middle line:84%
to pay out these
horrid premiums.

00:25:44.076 --> 00:25:46.845 align:middle line:84%
Does the Obamacare look like
it's going to help people

00:25:46.845 --> 00:25:48.914 align:middle line:84%
like me so I can have
something like even a 200

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:50.182 align:middle line:90%
or 300-dollar premium?

00:25:50.182 --> 00:25:52.217 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: You'll have a
15,000-dollar deductible,

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:56.355 align:middle line:84%
you still have to come of that
out-of-pocket for that anyway.

00:25:56.355 --> 00:26:01.326 align:middle line:84%
So, imagine you hadn't paid into
a system for what's roughly 12--

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:03.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's so depressing
to think what I've been paying.

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:04.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Yeah, let's say
12,000 dollars a year.

00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:06.131 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:09.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Multiply that
by 10, 120,000 by 20.

00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:11.536 align:middle line:84%
Now you're at half
a million dollar

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:12.671 align:middle line:90%
or a quarter million dollars.

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:14.072 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right, for nothing.

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:15.607 align:middle line:90%
I don't even go to the facility.

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:17.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: What could you--
and you never used it.

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:21.747 align:middle line:84%
And Regina, I know you, so you
had continued to used proactive,

00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:22.681 align:middle line:90%
preventative healthcare--

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:23.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:24.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- and you
pay out-of-pocket

00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:25.017 align:middle line:90%
for those services.

00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:26.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:27.686 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Anyway, which is
what we all need to be doing.

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.756 align:middle line:84%
Which gives... that's
on top of the premium.

00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: That keeps
you healthy.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.625 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So, it's kept your
preexisting condition

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:36.361 align:middle line:84%
at bay significantly and
has kept you healthy.

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:37.963 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So I don't know.

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:39.898 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm waiting to
see if they cancel me.

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:40.599 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:41.566 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Imagine what--

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:42.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They can't
just allow.

00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:43.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: It could be the
best thing that will happen

00:26:43.568 --> 00:26:44.269 align:middle line:90%
to you, think about it.

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.371 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm-- I'm up for it.

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:47.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Think about what you
can do for the next, you know,

00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:48.240 align:middle line:84%
10 years of your life
or whatever what,

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.341 align:middle line:90%
you know, but--

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But is it
possible that I'm going

00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:52.878 align:middle line:84%
to have a cheaper
premium under Obamacare

00:26:52.878 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:84%
with that 15,000-dollar
deductible?

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I'll just
say this right now.

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:59.384 align:middle line:84%
I highly doubt, this plan
is that they're going

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:00.652 align:middle line:90%
to fully see the effect.

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:01.219 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:02.054 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:27:02.054 --> 00:27:02.988 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's another thing.

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:04.289 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:06.725 align:middle line:84%
We're on it a bit ago, they
didn't meet their numbers.

00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:11.229 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed to be-- if
in full effect by March of 2000.

00:27:11.229 --> 00:27:12.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: March 1st,
2013 is when--

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:13.432 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: 2014.

00:27:13.432 --> 00:27:14.833 align:middle line:90%
2014.

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: 2014 is when the plan
is supposed to fully take place.

00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:17.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But they're
so far off their numbers.

00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:19.171 align:middle line:84%
They've already delayed
it, right?

00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:20.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: The clock is
supposed to start ticking

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:23.675 align:middle line:84%
after which time, if you're
not in by that deadline,

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:26.578 align:middle line:84%
you start to-- you'll
be subject to fines.

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:27.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: And you have--

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.314 align:middle line:84%
you have an option
to take the fines.

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:30.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But have
they delayed that?

00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:31.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, not officially
but they have no choice.

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:33.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They have no choice
but to delay, so we don't know.

00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:35.654 align:middle line:84%
It could be delayed
until 2015 or whatever

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.456 align:middle line:84%
until they get their
promise worked out.

00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:40.425 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at-- if we're
now considering going outside

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:42.794 align:middle line:84%
the system, then we've been
cancelled and it's like,

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:46.698 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy not to pay 800 a
month or whatever it is," and...

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:47.833 align:middle line:90%
close to 800 a month.

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:48.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I'm sure you
can figure what you'd

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:49.267 align:middle line:90%
like to do with 10,000, 12,000--

00:27:49.267 --> 00:27:50.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:27:50.469 --> 00:27:51.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- dollars a
year extra of your money.

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:52.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:54.706 align:middle line:84%
Then we look at--
how much is the fine?

00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:56.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Fine is-- we're
looking at right now,

00:27:56.742 --> 00:27:58.910 align:middle line:84%
is as little as
95 dollars a year.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: As
what's on the other end?,

00:28:00.312 --> 00:28:02.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And it could be
I think it's 1 or 2 percent

00:28:02.214 --> 00:28:03.682 align:middle line:84%
of your reported income
but it never grows.

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:04.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow.

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:06.051 align:middle line:84%
So for people that are
making a decent income,

00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:07.886 align:middle line:84%
it could still be
in the thousands.

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:09.688 align:middle line:84%
The fine could be in
the thousands, right?

00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:11.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: That's a
very decent income.

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:12.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not my income.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.759 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:14.726 align:middle line:90%
It is for some people.

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.828 align:middle line:84%
Most people would
be in a hundred.

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:18.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: It's a
slap on the wrist.

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:19.131 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:28:19.131 --> 00:28:20.065 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Frankly,
and that's supposed

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:20.766 align:middle line:84%
to be the first couple
of years--

00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:21.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:22.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- and
then after that,

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:23.468 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to stiffen.

00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:24.636 align:middle line:84%
The people I-- the
groups I really feel

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:26.471 align:middle line:84%
for are the small
business owners.

00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:28.807 align:middle line:84%
That's the true ones who were
going to be filling the hit.

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.675 align:middle line:84%
And let me explain
what I mean by that.

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:32.878 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones who were
being forced on to plans

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:36.148 align:middle line:84%
for their employees beyond
which they can afford.

00:28:36.148 --> 00:28:37.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:39.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And so, what started
happening was they start

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:43.789 align:middle line:84%
defining the term of
full time as 30 hours,

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:46.158 align:middle line:90%
not 40 onto this plan.

00:28:46.158 --> 00:28:51.196 align:middle line:84%
So if you're at 30-hour or more
a week employee of X company,

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:53.865 align:middle line:84%
you would be in the full
time and you must be pushed--

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:55.066 align:middle line:90%
pushed on to this plan.

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:56.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the burden
falls on the employer.

00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: So when the
things started happening--

00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.738 align:middle line:84%
we're talking big
companies too--

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:04.776 align:middle line:84%
Walgreens, McDonalds having,
forcing people off of full time.

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:05.977 align:middle line:90%
People feeding their families,

00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:08.647 align:middle line:84%
used to be feeding their
families at 40 hours,

00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
now feeding their families
at 29.5 hours a week.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Just going
right under so they can--

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:15.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: So they don't
have to-- we see--

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:18.557 align:middle line:84%
or lower the workforce
to fire people.

00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:19.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:20.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Either
way, it's no good.

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:21.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's
happening--

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:23.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: It's been happening.

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:23.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- [inaudible]
the 29.5 hours

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:25.463 align:middle line:90%
to be the 30-hour limit?

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:27.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Yes, because these
companies are having the hedge

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:29.401 align:middle line:90%
of their finances well ahead.

00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:33.672 align:middle line:84%
They're projecting their
numbers and their costs.

00:29:33.672 --> 00:29:36.575 align:middle line:84%
So, we're looking at this
the last several quarters

00:29:36.575 --> 00:29:39.678 align:middle line:84%
of this year and last
year including last year

00:29:39.678 --> 00:29:41.012 align:middle line:84%
and we see people
getting dropped

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
down to below 30 hours just
to be able to keep the job.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.619 align:middle line:90%
That is the real--

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:48.153 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:49.254 align:middle line:90%
That's bad.

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:49.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- the real
life scenario that's

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:50.922 align:middle line:90%
happening everyday.

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
happening by the--

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: As a direct result
of the mandated healthcare.

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:56.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: That's again it, yeah.

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:57.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:58.897 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when you're
looking at this, we just talked

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:02.968 align:middle line:84%
about small business owners,
the undocumented workers

00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:04.769 align:middle line:84%
and residents are still
not going to be covered,

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:06.137 align:middle line:90%
they're excluded from it.

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Who else is really not
being served well by this?

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Just the taxpayers.

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:18.817 align:middle line:84%
The current system is never
going to be perfect but still--

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:20.285 align:middle line:84%
as I said earlier, it's
the best in the world.

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:21.186 align:middle line:90%
May I just say this?

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:24.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Doctors are--
of all the professionals,

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:30.161 align:middle line:84%
the most giving and generous
and self-sacrificing.

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:34.065 align:middle line:84%
However, we have been
demonized by the politicians,

00:30:34.065 --> 00:30:36.635 align:middle line:90%
by big farm or big corporate.

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:39.137 align:middle line:84%
Frankly, we've been demonized
as the caused of the problem.

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:41.072 align:middle line:90%
We are charging too much money.

00:30:41.072 --> 00:30:43.275 align:middle line:84%
If you just look at the
sacrifice at the average,

00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
MD or any other physician,
frankly,

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.612 align:middle line:90%
alternative as well makes.

00:30:47.612 --> 00:30:50.482 align:middle line:84%
We're talking minimum of 5
to 10 years of schooling.

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:53.418 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
out-of-pockets costs of tuition

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
associated with but that's five

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.789 align:middle line:90%
to 10 years of lost income.

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:01.426 align:middle line:84%
Well, other people about similar
age are working their way

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:05.697 align:middle line:84%
up the employment ladder,
building their wealth.

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:09.067 align:middle line:84%
We're sacrificing our wealth,
taking out loans for things

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:11.803 align:middle line:84%
that we hope it will pay
us in the future back.

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're supposed to
also then gain to a system.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.710 align:middle line:84%
That's, you know, where
we have to be giving

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.545 align:middle line:90%
and we're expected to be giving.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:23.515 align:middle line:84%
I've-- Like I said,
I never known doctors

00:31:23.515 --> 00:31:26.351 align:middle line:84%
to turn people away even in
the private clinic setting.

00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:28.520 align:middle line:84%
We cut bills for
people all the time.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.289 align:middle line:84%
When people are on
Access or Medicare,

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:34.592 align:middle line:84%
we allow for significant
reductions especially

00:31:34.592 --> 00:31:36.194 align:middle line:90%
if they're paying out-of-pocket,

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:39.230 align:middle line:84%
if they don't have
insurance provision.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.735 align:middle line:84%
I, myself, I'd probably given
away more money and services

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:46.838 align:middle line:84%
than I have actually
earned, in frank income.

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:48.707 align:middle line:90%
And I'm OK with that.

00:31:48.707 --> 00:31:50.075 align:middle line:90%
I'm not complaining one bit.

00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:51.409 align:middle line:90%
But I do have a problem.

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:55.013 align:middle line:84%
I do take issue when someone
tells me I need to give more

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:57.782 align:middle line:90%
or I'm not doing my bit.

00:31:57.782 --> 00:32:01.186 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have and-- numerous
doctors who'd had the privilege

00:32:01.186 --> 00:32:04.522 align:middle line:84%
of serving out of the country
even, doctors without borders,

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:09.027 align:middle line:84%
but even within this country
giving to people, not asking,

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:11.796 align:middle line:84%
you know, for Social
Security numbers

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:13.365 align:middle line:90%
or documentation, nothing.

00:32:13.365 --> 00:32:16.167 align:middle line:84%
You're in need, I'm here to help
you and I'm here to help you

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:18.636 align:middle line:90%
through any resource that I can.

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:20.905 align:middle line:90%
We give of ourselves so much.

00:32:20.905 --> 00:32:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know in the
other professionals

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.076 align:middle line:84%
who routinely give
of themselves.

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:26.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: To that degree

00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:26.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: To that degree.

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:28.179 align:middle line:90%
I can give so many examples.

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:29.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We're talking off
cam and you're saying, you know,

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:30.982 align:middle line:84%
you had-- that people have
no problem calling you up

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:34.285 align:middle line:84%
and saying, "Hey Dr. Carlos,
you know, I'm down and out--

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Happens all the time.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- and I need
some help and, you know,

00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:38.056 align:middle line:90%
can we come in to you--

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: More than like
family and friends-- yeah.

00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:40.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- can you write
me a script, can you do this

00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:41.559 align:middle line:90%
for me and that for me?"

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:45.463 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, if you're
involved in a real estate deal,

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:48.933 align:middle line:84%
how often do you see a realtor
cutting you a deal and saying,

00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:51.736 align:middle line:84%
"Hey, let's cut that
percentage in half?"

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:53.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: [Inaudible] to give
me one percent back just to--

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And not to knock
realtors, I'm just saying.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: But that's
a perfect example.

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:59.511 align:middle line:84%
And it only cost 500
dollars to become a realtor.

00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:02.947 align:middle line:84%
It can cost a million dollars
to become a doctor but it's not.

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:05.083 align:middle line:84%
You're actually out of school
and consider like I said,

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:06.618 align:middle line:84%
the back income that
you've lost,

00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:09.387 align:middle line:84%
you're well over a million
dollars out already.

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:11.389 align:middle line:90%
It's a big difference.

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:12.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: [Inaudible]
your system is not going

00:33:12.424 --> 00:33:13.525 align:middle line:90%
to help matters in.

00:33:13.525 --> 00:33:14.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: It's worse
'cause doctors are going

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:14.759 align:middle line:90%
to get squeezed--

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:15.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:16.161 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: -- on their payouts.

00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:16.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.096 align:middle line:90%
Let's look--

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: A lot of doctors are
dropping off to networks just

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:19.564 align:middle line:90%
by based on particular surveys.

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:20.865 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's bad.

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:21.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I want you to get
into some details of that.

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:23.935 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch part 2 of the--

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:24.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Oh, there's more?

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.204 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh yeah.

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:29.240 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the White House
promise on how Obamacare is--

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: OK.

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:30.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- going to
assist us, help us--

00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:32.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: OK.

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- make our
lives higher quality.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: All right.

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let's take a look.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.085 align:middle line:90%
>> President Barack Obama:

00:33:40.085 --> 00:33:41.686 align:middle line:84%
The only thing this plan would
eliminate is the hundreds

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:44.322 align:middle line:84%
of billions of dollars
in waste and fraud,

00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:47.258 align:middle line:84%
as well as unwarranted
subsidies in Medicare that go

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:49.027 align:middle line:90%
to insurance companies.

00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:51.596 align:middle line:84%
And we will also create
an independent commission

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:54.165 align:middle line:84%
of doctors and medical
experts charged

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:57.035 align:middle line:84%
with identifying more
waste in the years ahead.

00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:59.971 align:middle line:84%
These steps will
ensure that you,

00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:04.175 align:middle line:84%
America's seniors get the
benefits you've been promised.

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:07.145 align:middle line:84%
And we can use some of the
savings to fill the gap

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:10.215 align:middle line:84%
in coverage that forces too
many seniors to pay thousands

00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:12.717 align:middle line:84%
of dollars a year out
of their own pockets

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:13.985 align:middle line:90%
for prescription drugs.

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:16.186 align:middle line:84%
Many in this chamber,
particularly

00:34:16.186 --> 00:34:19.824 align:middle line:84%
on the Republican side of
the isle, have long insisted

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:22.961 align:middle line:84%
that reforming our medical
malpractice laws can help bring

00:34:22.961 --> 00:34:24.762 align:middle line:90%
down the cost of healthcare.

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I know that the Bush
administration considered

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.666 align:middle line:84%
authorizing demonstration
projects

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:31.603 align:middle line:84%
in individual states
to test these ideas.

00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:35.507 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a good idea, and
I am directing my Secretary

00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:37.742 align:middle line:84%
of Health and Human
Services to move forward

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:40.912 align:middle line:90%
on this initiative today.

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.151 align:middle line:84%
So, let's get a little bit more
into how this plan is going

00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:48.019 align:middle line:84%
to affect the livelihood
of doctors.

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:50.521 align:middle line:84%
Who-- The insurance
companies, I think that's

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:52.223 align:middle line:90%
such a big messy load there.

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:54.893 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're still talking
about the same providers.

00:34:54.893 --> 00:34:56.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:34:56.293 --> 00:34:57.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So it's not-- I'm not
quite understanding how we're

00:34:57.962 --> 00:34:59.931 align:middle line:84%
going to say billions on
insurance when we're talking

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:02.634 align:middle line:84%
about the same providers with
increased premiums, but--

00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:04.202 align:middle line:84%
so let's just get to
the doctors part of it.

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:06.604 align:middle line:84%
That part is something
you know really well.

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:07.705 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
What is the disincentive
now under this plan

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.909 align:middle line:90%
for doctors to continue on?

00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:13.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: We really don't know
until it's fully implemented

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:15.346 align:middle line:84%
that like I said, let's
just hope it's not.

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:17.749 align:middle line:84%
But if you go onto the
healthcare marketplace,

00:35:17.749 --> 00:35:21.186 align:middle line:84%
healthcare.gov marketplace,
what you'll see is--

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:23.388 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't say, you know,

00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:25.023 align:middle line:84%
US government provided
a healthcare.

00:35:25.023 --> 00:35:27.025 align:middle line:84%
What it does say is
it's still reflected

00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:29.527 align:middle line:84%
through the big five
or six carriers.

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:33.798 align:middle line:84%
You'll see it at the United,
Blue Cross, Humana, Kaiser.

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:36.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And then-- Kaisers
and administrator, yeah.

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:39.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: So it's the
same exact companies

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:42.941 align:middle line:84%
with the government backing
the government subsidies still

00:35:42.941 --> 00:35:44.008 align:middle line:90%
making the money.

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:46.311 align:middle line:84%
And guess what's
happening in the meantime.

00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:49.347 align:middle line:84%
All the smaller companies,
the ones we've demonized

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:52.517 align:middle line:84%
as being privatized and greedy
have now been pushed out.

00:35:52.517 --> 00:35:56.721 align:middle line:84%
You don't see smaller
companies in there, you know,

00:35:56.721 --> 00:36:01.392 align:middle line:84%
owned by much smaller
group, individuals.

00:36:01.392 --> 00:36:02.827 align:middle line:90%
They're getting pushed out.

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're seeing is
bigger Wall Street money being

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.066 align:middle line:84%
reflected right there for
the healthcare.gov website.

00:36:08.066 --> 00:36:10.835 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've done
essentially is we've rewarded

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:15.373 align:middle line:84%
the big corporate of individual
entities and push everybody out.

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:17.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But the interesting
thing is those large corporate

00:36:17.075 --> 00:36:21.746 align:middle line:84%
entities like Kaiser and some
of the others, traditionally,

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:24.549 align:middle line:84%
the MDs in those systems
are paid less anyway

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.184 align:middle line:90%
when they're with an HMO.

00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:27.619 align:middle line:90%
It's a salary, the position--

00:36:27.619 --> 00:36:30.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Just looks very
much like an HMO situation.

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:30.655 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:31.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: HMO doctors
are overwhelmed.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:34.559 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: They've seen so
many patients everyday.

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh, like
every seven minutes.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: It's not--
There's no art to that.

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Hippocrates rolling
over in his grave going,

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.766 align:middle line:84%
"This is not what I intended,"
[inaudible] Father of medicine.

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:44.102 align:middle line:84%
This time you need to spend time
with patients, get to know them.

00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:46.504 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that in
that type of setting.

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:48.006 align:middle line:90%
It's disastrous.

00:36:48.006 --> 00:36:50.575 align:middle line:84%
The number one complaint
that people have

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:51.909 align:middle line:90%
in the doctor's office,

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:56.814 align:middle line:84%
you probably know is the doctor
has didn't spend any time

00:36:56.814 --> 00:36:57.448 align:middle line:90%
with me--

00:36:57.448 --> 00:36:58.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:36:58.416 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- doctor
didn't listen,

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.119 align:middle line:84%
doctor just wrote
me prescription.

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:03.054 align:middle line:84%
It's only going to get
worse in this situation.

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:06.591 align:middle line:84%
Imagine everybody being
pushed into an HMO setting.

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:08.526 align:middle line:84%
The opposite or the
better aspect

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:12.730 align:middle line:84%
of insurance is Preferred
Provider Network or PPO.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.767 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we want
and that's what we get to--

00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:17.035 align:middle line:90%
we used to get to choose.

00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:18.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:18.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And I don't
believe we're going to get

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:20.338 align:middle line:90%
to choose that anymore.

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We're not going to be
able to choose our own doctors?

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:22.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: The power of choice.

00:37:22.407 --> 00:37:24.542 align:middle line:84%
Not if you're assigned these
doctors in the network,

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.978 align:middle line:84%
you're going to-- that doctor
then becomes the gatekeeper

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:29.981 align:middle line:84%
as to how much care you
get, whether you can get,

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.582 align:middle line:90%
refer to a specialist or not.

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:34.352 align:middle line:84%
That's the sort of the--
that was the word I'm--

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:38.456 align:middle line:84%
the signature aspect
of the HMO setting.

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:41.092 align:middle line:84%
You don't get anything
without the OK of that doctor.

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:43.895 align:middle line:84%
What doctor can't possibly
know what you need in a three

00:37:43.895 --> 00:37:48.266 align:middle line:84%
or four-minute visit, maybe
with him or her but more likely

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:50.335 align:middle line:90%
with his PA or his MA.

00:37:50.335 --> 00:37:51.502 align:middle line:90%
It's really difficult.

00:37:51.502 --> 00:37:53.071 align:middle line:84%
You'd become a number
in a system,

00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:54.405 align:middle line:90%
the quality of care goes down.

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:55.873 align:middle line:90%
It does not go up.

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:57.208 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:59.544 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, what would
this look like to young person

00:37:59.544 --> 00:38:02.714 align:middle line:84%
that is deciding a career path
and has always wanted to be

00:38:02.714 --> 00:38:05.917 align:middle line:84%
in the healing arts and
doctor specifically?

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:07.618 align:middle line:84%
If they're looking
at to that lens,

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:11.422 align:middle line:84%
how many of them choose this
path saying, "Hey, I want to go

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:13.024 align:middle line:90%
in and be part of an HMO."

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:13.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yeah.

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:14.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Is that--

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: It looks terrible.

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:17.095 align:middle line:90%
It looks terrible.

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:18.062 align:middle line:84%
You're coming out of
school with hundreds

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:19.364 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of dollars
have debt.

00:38:19.364 --> 00:38:20.565 align:middle line:90%
All this lost time--

00:38:20.565 --> 00:38:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- relatively
modest salary considering.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: You're 20, so
basically gone from your life.

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:25.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:26.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you're
looking balance

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:28.506 align:middle line:84%
to your early mid-30s before you
can actually start your career,

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:34.112 align:middle line:84%
not 21 like most people, and
the payouts being abysmal.

00:38:34.112 --> 00:38:35.513 align:middle line:90%
It looks horrible.

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:38.383 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to see very much
fewer family practice doctors

00:38:38.383 --> 00:38:41.252 align:middle line:84%
and general primary care doctors
'cause there's no payback.

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:44.155 align:middle line:84%
Instead we're going to start
seeing a much more specialists

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:47.058 align:middle line:84%
and surgeons and we need those,
but [inaudible] on those--

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:49.260 align:middle line:84%
you know, on those people
as well, the payout is going

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.129 align:middle line:90%
to be less, less motivation.

00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:54.065 align:middle line:84%
What you're going to see is
a lot more private practice

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:57.769 align:middle line:84%
physicians, entities who will
only take people who can afford

00:38:57.769 --> 00:38:59.971 align:middle line:84%
to pay out-of-pocket
for their care.

00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:02.507 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else is going
to get lost in the mix.

00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:05.009 align:middle line:84%
So that doctor that you
wanted to keep, you'll be able

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.645 align:middle line:84%
to keep him or her but you
have to pay out-of-pocket

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:09.080 align:middle line:84%
because that doctor
is not going to want

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.483 align:middle line:90%
to participate in this plan.

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:14.085 align:middle line:90%
That's the reality of it.

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
You get to keep your
doctor but you got to pay

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.921 align:middle line:90%
for it, out-of-pocket.

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:18.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, they
didn't tell you that part.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: No.

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:20.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What about--

00:39:20.258 --> 00:39:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Is dental care had any
of this embedded in here?

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.396 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Let's not talk about
too much but it's in there

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:27.665 align:middle line:84%
and no one ever talks
about the dental care.

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:30.168 align:middle line:84%
I pay 18 dollars a month
for my dental care.

00:39:30.168 --> 00:39:32.069 align:middle line:84%
Yes, still have to
pay a percentage but--

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:33.104 align:middle line:90%
>>Regina: Right.

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:35.072 align:middle line:84%
>>Santo: -- the reduction
costs to me.

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:38.543 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking, you know,
10, 15 dollars for cleaning.

00:39:38.543 --> 00:39:40.211 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who can afford that?

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:43.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: You know, it's amazing
in 50 to 60 percent reduction is

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:46.451 align:middle line:84%
in major dental procedures
such as a crown

00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:47.618 align:middle line:90%
or something like that or not.

00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that's
available and expensively

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.321 align:middle line:90%
to most everyone anyway?

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:51.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: They are right now.

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:53.224 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what's going
to happen because this--

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:55.393 align:middle line:84%
there's supposed to be dental
writers with these new plans

00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:58.596 align:middle line:84%
that could throw everyone off
their dental coverage as well.

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:00.098 align:middle line:84%
And this I'm sure hoping
not 'cause I don't want

00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:00.798 align:middle line:90%
to lose that.

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:01.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, right.

00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: It's been my--
it's been my savior--

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:05.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- in my life is
having excellent dental care

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:07.071 align:middle line:90%
with phenomenal dentist--

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:08.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:10.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- for extremely
low premium per month.

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:11.976 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:15.313 align:middle line:84%
Now, you talked about people
accessing the site and trying

00:40:15.313 --> 00:40:17.982 align:middle line:90%
to make an intelligent decision

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:19.817 align:middle line:84%
about what options are
laid out for them there.

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:22.253 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to read
this, this little--

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:24.355 align:middle line:84%
this actually I think
was forwarded from you

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:26.257 align:middle line:90%
and I think this is hysterical.

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:29.961 align:middle line:84%
This was from the
Daily Bret Blog.

00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:32.563 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Oh, this one
is catching a lot of--

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's getting-- yes,
it's moving around the internet.

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:36.667 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it's saying,
"Putting things in perspective:

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:41.172 align:middle line:84%
March 21st 2010 to
October 1st 2013 is 3years,

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:42.273 align:middle line:90%
6 months, 10 days.

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:44.575 align:middle line:90%
December 7th, 1941 to May 8th,

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:49.380 align:middle line:84%
1945 is 3 years, 5
months and 1 day.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.917 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that in
the time we were attacked

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:55.920 align:middle line:84%
at Pearl Harbor to the day
Germany surrendered is not

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.256 align:middle line:84%
enough time for this
progressive federal government

00:40:58.256 --> 00:41:00.758 align:middle line:90%
to build a working webpage, OK.

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:04.562 align:middle line:84%
Mobilization millions, building
tens of thousands of tanks,

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:07.798 align:middle line:84%
jeeps, planes, subs, cruisers,
destroyers, torpedoes,

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:11.035 align:middle line:84%
millions upon millions of
guns, bombs, ammo, et cetera.

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:14.438 align:middle line:84%
Turning the tide in North
Africa, Invading Italy, D-Day,

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:16.274 align:middle line:90%
Battle of Bulge, Race to Berlin,

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:20.011 align:middle line:84%
all while we were also fighting
the Japanese in the Pacific.

00:41:20.011 --> 00:41:21.479 align:middle line:90%
And in that amount of time,

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:25.316 align:middle line:84%
this administration cannot
build a functioning webpage."

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:31.556 align:middle line:84%
And to go on from that which
also interesting is that a trio

00:41:31.556 --> 00:41:35.059 align:middle line:84%
of kids out of Silicon
Valley tell us about this.

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:38.796 align:middle line:84%
They'd built a page in three
days that is totally functional

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:41.599 align:middle line:84%
where you can actually access
and see what's available

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:90%
in your region for what price.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.902 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what happened there.

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, you know,
first of all, if we were on one

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.072 align:middle line:90%
of the three-letter networks--

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:49.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:50.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- I may have
to define the reference

00:41:50.141 --> 00:41:52.176 align:middle line:84%
to that Bret Baier
little email--

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:53.244 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That was FOX.

00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:54.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- was a
World War II reference.

00:41:54.212 --> 00:41:54.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, that
World War II.

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: A lot of
the other listeners

00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:57.248 align:middle line:90%
to those types of stations--

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:58.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:41:58.649 --> 00:41:59.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- would never have
gotten in that reference but--

00:41:59.317 --> 00:42:00.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:42:00.418 --> 00:42:01.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- I know your
audience knows this.

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:04.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we've received
our cancellation notice.

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:07.825 align:middle line:84%
We start, you know,
searching around,

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:09.994 align:middle line:84%
poking around the website
and we find something else

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:13.965 align:middle line:84%
but it says bad or even higher
premiums, very high deductibles

00:42:13.965 --> 00:42:16.133 align:middle line:84%
and we finally say,
"I don't want--

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:17.702 align:middle line:90%
and we can't choose our doctor."

00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:20.471 align:middle line:84%
Then we say, "I don't
want to this anymore."

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:24.408 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a very frightening
thing for most people because we

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:29.046 align:middle line:84%
and the mass have been brain
washed into believing we will go

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:31.749 align:middle line:84%
into financial ruin if
anything happens to us.

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:37.655 align:middle line:84%
First of all, well, you
cannot disallow student loans

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:40.925 align:middle line:84%
under by the newest
bankruptcy laws.

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:44.295 align:middle line:84%
You can still apply
for bankruptcy

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.964 align:middle line:90%
under financial hardship, right?

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:49.066 align:middle line:90%
We're having to do with medical.

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:51.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I'm not going
to ever condone bankruptcy

00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:51.969 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:90%
But the--

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.438 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I understand that
but I'm saying let's start

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:56.507 align:middle line:84%
with worst case scenarios
and go to the best.

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:57.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: If worst
case scenario happened,

00:42:57.975 --> 00:42:59.176 align:middle line:84%
then you could bankrupt
medical debt.

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:00.411 align:middle line:90%
That's the bottom line.

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:01.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That can
still be done.

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I'm not
suggesting that but--

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I know.

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:04.115 align:middle line:90%
I'm not either but--

00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:04.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- people
don't realize.

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:05.983 align:middle line:90%
But you can't-- by contrast,

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:08.019 align:middle line:84%
you cannot bankrupt
student loan debt.

00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:09.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: That's
another scam on its own.

00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:11.656 align:middle line:84%
They don't come back
for that one.

00:43:11.656 --> 00:43:12.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:13.024 align:middle line:90%
Yes. But anyway, just--

00:43:13.024 --> 00:43:14.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: But the--

00:43:14.225 --> 00:43:14.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's start
with the big milestone.

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: People have--

00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:17.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You have a
220,000 dollar bill,

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:19.797 align:middle line:84%
you don't have any insurance
'cause you brought it out

00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:22.133 align:middle line:90%
and now what can you do?

00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:23.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, let's
look at first of all,

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:25.536 align:middle line:84%
who's going to really get
us 100,000 dollar bill?

00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:27.438 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting that
there aren't people

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.774 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of need.

00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:32.443 align:middle line:84%
The biggest risk we take when
step outside of our house,

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.111 align:middle line:84%
and most of us had
drivers licenses,

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:37.982 align:middle line:84%
and most of us drive
cars is in your car.

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:41.852 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest risk on
dollar-- for dollar basis.

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:44.555 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest
risk you take everyday.

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:47.858 align:middle line:84%
And guess what, your
car insurance is going

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:49.860 align:middle line:90%
to cover you for medical care.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.897 align:middle line:84%
And if you're living in one of
12 no fault states in the US,

00:43:52.897 --> 00:43:55.433 align:middle line:84%
then you're actually going
to be covered under--

00:43:55.433 --> 00:43:56.901 align:middle line:90%
had extra medical coverage.

00:43:56.901 --> 00:43:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't live in
no-fault state, and I suggest,

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.908 align:middle line:84%
you know, those of you listeners
and watcher, those viewers look

00:44:03.908 --> 00:44:06.377 align:middle line:84%
into their personal
insurance in your state.

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:08.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Maybe wise to
bump up your comprehensive

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:09.413 align:middle line:90%
and all that in liability.

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:10.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: You can do something
called medical pay or med pay.

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.750 align:middle line:84%
We call that in Arizona
for instance.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And what you can do is for as
little as 15 dollars a year,

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.255 align:middle line:84%
you can bump up your
medical coverage above

00:44:18.255 --> 00:44:21.258 align:middle line:90%
and beyond what you, you know,

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.893 align:middle line:84%
your plan will already
allow you.

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:24.061 align:middle line:84%
This is the car insurance
[inaudible].

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:26.931 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- This is
not medical insurance.

00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:28.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And even if you had

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:29.867 align:middle line:84%
that dastardly 15,000
dollar deductible--

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:31.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Med pay
will cover that.

00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:32.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- med pay will
pay for your deductible.

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:33.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: That's correct.

00:44:33.304 --> 00:44:34.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But that's
if you're covered.

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:34.839 align:middle line:90%
What if you opted out?

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Well, the med pay is--

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.043 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so you have a
broken arm or broken, you know,

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:41.645 align:middle line:84%
hip and, you know, legs,
something like that?

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: You'll be amazed
at how-- how you can--

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.684 align:middle line:84%
when you communicate, not
only with doctors but labs

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:48.719 align:middle line:90%
and imaging centers, help--

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:51.222 align:middle line:84%
maybe being helped
through your doctor.

00:44:51.222 --> 00:44:52.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you have
your car insurance.

00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:53.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: How much
buying power you have

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:56.093 align:middle line:84%
as a consumer, you
don't realize.

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:59.163 align:middle line:84%
I routinely refer patients
over to an imaging center

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:03.267 align:middle line:84%
in Arizona called Southwest
Medical Imagining Limited,

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:04.535 align:middle line:90%
the smile is there.

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.303 align:middle line:90%
I want free perk for them.

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:07.671 align:middle line:90%
But I like them a lot.

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:11.342 align:middle line:84%
They will work with patients
on doctor referral or you want

00:45:11.342 --> 00:45:13.711 align:middle line:84%
to walk in and get
something done, you can do it.

00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:18.349 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of cases, they have a
cash price that's a minimum 40

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:21.452 align:middle line:84%
percent reduced of
their retail cost

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:23.320 align:middle line:84%
because you are paying
out-of-pocket for it.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.089 align:middle line:90%
And they have payment plans.

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:28.359 align:middle line:84%
Typical x-ray for a lumbar spine
which is what I would offer

00:45:28.359 --> 00:45:29.994 align:middle line:84%
and refer patient out
for a low back pain.

00:45:29.994 --> 00:45:32.163 align:middle line:84%
This is very common, you
know, cause of lost work

00:45:32.163 --> 00:45:34.098 align:middle line:84%
and then lost work
hours in the workplace.

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:39.136 align:middle line:84%
Out-of-pocket cost to the
patient is roughly 70 dollars

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:41.071 align:middle line:90%
for what we call a two-view.

00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.474 align:middle line:84%
Well, two-view of
the lumbar spine

00:45:43.474 --> 00:45:46.210 align:middle line:84%
for an x-ray out-of-pocket,
not bad.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Not bad.

00:45:47.278 --> 00:45:48.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: That's a
cost of a cable bill--

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.314 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: -- for some people.

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:51.515 align:middle line:84%
I like to give, you
know, perspective.

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:53.584 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that person say
then based on that study,

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I needed them to refer the
study and look into an MRI,

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.154 align:middle line:90%
that person could be looking

00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:59.957 align:middle line:84%
at about 500 dollars
out-of-pocket--

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:00.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:46:00.825 --> 00:46:02.226 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- for
that same thing.

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.894 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the person has insurance
coverage whether it's current

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:06.397 align:middle line:84%
plan or under government
plan and they have

00:46:06.397 --> 00:46:08.899 align:middle line:84%
to pay a certain
amount out-of-pocket,

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:10.601 align:middle line:90%
it's going to come out to--

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:13.137 align:middle line:84%
still come out to less
because in out-of-pocket cost,

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:14.672 align:middle line:84%
after insurance pays
their portion

00:46:14.672 --> 00:46:17.942 align:middle line:84%
and the consumer pays their
portion, it is still the same.

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:21.545 align:middle line:84%
The difference is the person
who's not covered is not paying

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:22.980 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of dollars a month--

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:25.216 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- thousands
of dollars per a year

00:46:25.216 --> 00:46:26.784 align:middle line:84%
and over the course
of a lifetime hundreds

00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:29.186 align:middle line:84%
of thousands dollars to
an insurance company.

00:46:29.186 --> 00:46:31.522 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to
ultimately benefit them anyway

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:32.623 align:middle line:90%
in the long run.

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:35.025 align:middle line:84%
So if you're relatively
healthy individual,

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:36.861 align:middle line:84%
you may not even
need health coverage

00:46:36.861 --> 00:46:41.165 align:middle line:84%
because you're doing the
proactive steps to be healthy

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:42.733 align:middle line:84%
and stay out of the
doctor's office.

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:47.404 align:middle line:84%
You will realize how much buying
power you have when you talk

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:50.441 align:middle line:84%
to these companies and
it's not so scary anymore.

00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:52.576 align:middle line:84%
One of a big point I'm wanting
to make, I actually forgot

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:56.013 align:middle line:84%
to bring up until this moment
is healthcare coverage,

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:59.149 align:middle line:84%
does not equate with
healthcare provision.

00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:00.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What's that mean?

00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:02.353 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: These politicians
continued to say

00:47:02.353 --> 00:47:05.322 align:middle line:84%
that people would be
dying in the streets

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:07.691 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
having healthcare.

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:09.960 align:middle line:90%
No one does not have healthcare.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.663 align:middle line:84%
No one is denied healthcare
as we said earlier.

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:15.933 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has access to
the healthcare system.

00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:19.570 align:middle line:84%
People have been disenfranchised
deliberately to believe

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:23.107 align:middle line:84%
that because they're poor or
because they're a certain race,

00:47:23.107 --> 00:47:26.010 align:middle line:84%
because they're certain
citizenship status

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:30.114 align:middle line:84%
that they are not allowed or
able to access the system,

00:47:30.114 --> 00:47:31.549 align:middle line:90%
then that's an outright lie.

00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:34.451 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the things
that makes me be most angry.

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:37.888 align:middle line:90%
No one is denied care.

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:39.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:47:39.023 --> 00:47:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And this is
the biggest, I think,

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.963 align:middle line:84%
difference between what the big
networks are wanting to address

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:47.064 align:middle line:90%
and then what [inaudible]--

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:48.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What we're
addressing today.

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:50.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: -- trying to
address, absolutely.

00:47:50.301 --> 00:47:52.803 align:middle line:84%
Care and coverage are two
entirely different things.

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:55.806 align:middle line:84%
You can get care
without coverage

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:58.909 align:middle line:90%
and oftentimes, it's cheaper.

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.544 align:middle line:90%
It really can be cheaper.

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:01.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And we're
going to talk about some

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:04.315 align:middle line:84%
of the newer plans that we
can go into but I just want

00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:06.817 align:middle line:84%
to go back if people are
still kind of mulling

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:08.118 align:middle line:90%
over what I said earlier.

00:48:08.118 --> 00:48:10.087 align:middle line:84%
What if you are in a car
accident, you have your--

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:12.056 align:middle line:84%
you have your car
insurance which is going

00:48:12.056 --> 00:48:13.757 align:middle line:90%
to cover a good amount of it.

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:16.327 align:middle line:84%
Say, you're hospitalized
for a week or two weeks,

00:48:16.327 --> 00:48:18.729 align:middle line:84%
you have some seriously
broken bones, you know,

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:22.266 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little bit
of head trauma.

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:24.802 align:middle line:90%
Well, with your car insurance,

00:48:24.802 --> 00:48:28.172 align:middle line:84%
I mean under normal conditions
usually offset those costs,

00:48:28.172 --> 00:48:29.540 align:middle line:90%
those hospital costs?

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Yours or the
other drivers, absolutely.

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:31.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Well, well, OK.

00:48:31.875 --> 00:48:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yes.

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now, if you have
no-- well, you should--

00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:35.946 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't be out in the car
if you don't have healthcare.

00:48:35.946 --> 00:48:37.448 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you don't have
car insurance unless--

00:48:37.448 --> 00:48:39.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, by law, you're
not-- you're not allowed to.

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:40.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that's
going to cover that.

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:42.853 align:middle line:84%
So that takes care of the
fear over, oh, my god,

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.488 align:middle line:90%
what if I got in a car accident.

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:46.957 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
larger issues.

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:49.360 align:middle line:84%
What happens if someone
is starting

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.029 align:middle line:84%
to have some noticeable
problems, you know,

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:54.698 align:middle line:84%
certain thing growing on
their body that they go

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:57.601 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they have a biopsy
and find out it's cancerous

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.436 align:middle line:84%
and they're-- they don't
have health insurance,

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:00.938 align:middle line:90%
now what happens?

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:02.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, we
have one of the--

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:03.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You don't
catch cancer.

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:05.876 align:middle line:84%
I saw that Obama
said that in his--

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:09.913 align:middle line:84%
in that little PRPs we saw
about, you know, if you happen

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:11.949 align:middle line:84%
to catch cancer but
nonetheless, what do you do?

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:14.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Well, his
suggestion was access

00:49:14.518 --> 00:49:17.521 align:middle line:84%
to regular health screening such
as colonoscopies and mammograms.

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:18.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:19.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: We already
have those in place.

00:49:19.923 --> 00:49:22.326 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Planned Parenthood
has been offering mammograms

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:25.396 align:middle line:84%
for women at much reduced rates,
again, with government funding.

00:49:25.396 --> 00:49:28.499 align:middle line:84%
You see we have very
generous groups out there.

00:49:28.499 --> 00:49:30.968 align:middle line:84%
Very wealthy people and many
of whom don't even get named

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:34.238 align:middle line:84%
because that's not why they
do it, who have foundations

00:49:34.238 --> 00:49:38.342 align:middle line:84%
to help people when they
can't make it up themselves.

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:39.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK, so--

00:49:39.676 --> 00:49:41.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I have a friend who's
got stage four lung cancer

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:44.048 align:middle line:84%
and she has been receiving
her chemotherapy care

00:49:44.048 --> 00:49:47.785 align:middle line:84%
because of the generosity
of private donors.

00:49:47.785 --> 00:49:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Those private donors are
the very wealthy people

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.589 align:middle line:84%
that have been demonized
by the government.

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:54.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But they actually
put into these foundations.

00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:58.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: When people have
money and are honored for being

00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:00.330 align:middle line:84%
who they are, they're
going to give.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:03.534 align:middle line:84%
And we are the most giving
people and most giving country.

00:50:03.534 --> 00:50:08.205 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're sending
millions of dollars of money

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and resources to the Philippines

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.275 align:middle line:84%
for the tragedy that
just happened.

00:50:11.275 --> 00:50:12.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:13.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: I think back to
Haiti a few years ago--

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:13.844 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:14.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: -- same thing.

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:15.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:16.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: We send up well

00:50:16.246 --> 00:50:17.481 align:middle line:84%
over 100 million
dollars, tons of aid.

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:18.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:21.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Volunteers of time,
a colleague of mine went over

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:23.053 align:middle line:84%
and volunteered his
time as a physician.

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:25.856 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is going on the
same thing and we take care of--

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:29.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: We take care of our
own and we take care of others.

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:31.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So if
you do have cancer,

00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:35.999 align:middle line:84%
you can go to traditional root
to this various organizations

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.434 align:middle line:90%
if you want chemo and so forth.

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:38.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Absolutely.

00:50:38.268 --> 00:50:39.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The reality is a lot

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:40.671 align:middle line:84%
of people are foregoing
that anyway.

00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:42.406 align:middle line:84%
I mean Dr. James
Forsythe, for example,

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:45.008 align:middle line:84%
one of the top oncologists
in the country.

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:48.312 align:middle line:84%
One of the first oncologists
in the country started looking

00:50:48.312 --> 00:50:50.948 align:middle line:84%
at the stats of some of those
treatments and said "Hey,

00:50:50.948 --> 00:50:54.084 align:middle line:84%
there are other things you can
do, A, to reverse it; but B,

00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:55.486 align:middle line:90%
to prevent it all together."

00:50:55.486 --> 00:50:57.521 align:middle line:84%
And now that's where I want
to go, this whole thing

00:50:57.521 --> 00:50:59.890 align:middle line:90%
about genuine preventative care.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.959 align:middle line:84%
Not what Obama promises
because we don't know

00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:03.026 align:middle line:90%
if that stuff is going

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:04.995 align:middle line:84%
to be freely made
available to us or not.

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:07.064 align:middle line:84%
I mean we don't know
that it's going to be--

00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:08.265 align:middle line:90%
probably it's not going to be.

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:09.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: It's just can't.

00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's
say it's not.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.169 align:middle line:84%
Now, you along with
other physicians

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:15.038 align:middle line:84%
around the country are
doing some amazing things

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:16.607 align:middle line:90%
that just organically,

00:51:16.607 --> 00:51:18.775 align:middle line:84%
intuitively feel
really good to me.

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:21.645 align:middle line:84%
And it's called-- you know,
you would think it's only

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:23.981 align:middle line:84%
for the elite because it's
called a concierge type

00:51:23.981 --> 00:51:26.416 align:middle line:90%
of health service.

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:30.087 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what that
means because that sounds--

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:31.455 align:middle line:90%
well, it sounds more promising

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:34.691 align:middle line:84%
than even the promises Obama
made, you know, a few years ago.

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:35.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: No.

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:38.028 align:middle line:84%
For the [inaudible] 100,
200 dollars a month,

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:41.331 align:middle line:84%
a fraction of [inaudible]
for healthcare on other side,

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:42.933 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a private
sector, what we currently have

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:47.004 align:middle line:84%
or what this is going to be, you
actually get access to a doctor

00:51:47.004 --> 00:51:49.173 align:middle line:84%
that you want and the
care that you want.

00:51:49.173 --> 00:51:50.474 align:middle line:90%
And not a seven-minute visit.

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:52.242 align:middle line:90%
But frankly, a true visit.

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:55.646 align:middle line:84%
That doctor knows you, perhaps
has known you for many years

00:51:55.646 --> 00:51:59.416 align:middle line:84%
if not decades, you,
your family members.

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:02.085 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of care
that we're talking about.

00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:04.855 align:middle line:84%
The kind of care that used
to be characteristics of--

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:06.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We see in
black and white movies

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:08.025 align:middle line:84%
when the doctor comes around at
this [inaudible] 'cause we're

00:52:08.025 --> 00:52:09.626 align:middle line:90%
talking in-home.

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:10.561 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: In-home?

00:52:10.561 --> 00:52:11.595 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be in home.

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:12.629 align:middle line:90%
It could be in their office.

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:13.497 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It could
be in the office.

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:14.631 align:middle line:90%
But you're looking at and--

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: And I do a lot
of in-home care as well,

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:19.803 align:middle line:84%
'cause again, I just find that
satisfaction is tremendous.

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.406 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very highly
accessible physician and many

00:52:22.406 --> 00:52:25.976 align:middle line:84%
of my colleagues are very
highly accessible as well.

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.444 align:middle line:84%
And we need to [inaudible]
we back.

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:28.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's
talk about it.

00:52:28.779 --> 00:52:30.547 align:middle line:84%
There would be different levels,
there are different levels

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:35.285 align:middle line:84%
in this concierge service which
say for 100 dollars a month,

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:37.487 align:middle line:90%
what do you get on average?

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:39.823 align:middle line:84%
I mean I know everybody's
plans are slightly different,

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:40.524 align:middle line:90%
these are private.

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:41.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Well, let me--

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:43.393 align:middle line:84%
if I may just take a
moment to define the system

00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:44.528 align:middle line:90%
as it stands right now.

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:46.296 align:middle line:84%
And if we never had
the discussion

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:50.500 align:middle line:84%
of the Affordable Care Act,
OK, if we would look at

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.937 align:middle line:84%
and frankly talk to a lot of
progressive people and really,

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:57.774 align:middle line:84%
truly forward thinking
people, [inaudible] sort

00:52:57.774 --> 00:53:01.478 align:middle line:84%
to polled everybody and say what
would you just say are the top,

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:05.182 align:middle line:84%
you know, concerns or
problems in our system.

00:53:05.182 --> 00:53:07.684 align:middle line:90%
And they would be, in fact

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:09.219 align:middle line:84%
that we don't really
have a healthcare system,

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:10.487 align:middle line:90%
we have a sickness care system,

00:53:10.487 --> 00:53:13.724 align:middle line:84%
a system that actually
rewards people for being sick

00:53:13.724 --> 00:53:16.493 align:middle line:90%
or the converse-- the reverse.

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:18.462 align:middle line:84%
We do not reward people
from being healthy.

00:53:18.462 --> 00:53:19.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: And that's a problem.

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:21.832 align:middle line:90%
And excuse me.

00:53:21.832 --> 00:53:23.700 align:middle line:84%
That is something
that needs to change.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:27.804 align:middle line:84%
The more forward minded
physician's clinic especially

00:53:27.804 --> 00:53:31.408 align:middle line:84%
those in my profession and many
other professions like mine,

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:33.744 align:middle line:84%
we reward people
for being healthy.

00:53:33.744 --> 00:53:36.413 align:middle line:84%
A system like the one I'm
creating is a nonprofit,

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:39.816 align:middle line:84%
is one in fact that people would
return or receive dividends back

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:43.420 align:middle line:90%
to them in the face of care

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.124 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually
enjoy using that's proactive

00:53:47.124 --> 00:53:48.725 align:middle line:84%
chiropractic, massage,
acupuncture

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:51.561 align:middle line:84%
and naturopathic
consultations, nutrition,

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.897 align:middle line:84%
yoga instruction,
fitness training.

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:57.634 align:middle line:84%
All of that will be accessible
to people for staying healthy.

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:59.002 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And let's
talk about that--

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:01.204 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: A very small premium,
frankly, if you want to--

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:02.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, I mean like so
100 dollars a month brings you

00:54:02.873 --> 00:54:03.707 align:middle line:90%
what to?

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.442 align:middle line:90%
It's tiered, so however much--

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:06.710 align:middle line:84%
however far you want
to go into it.

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.312 align:middle line:84%
So for 100 dollars a
month brings you what?

00:54:08.312 --> 00:54:09.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: You can get a--

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:10.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A couple
of 100 a month?

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:11.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: The minimum will get

00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:13.784 align:middle line:84%
for 100 dollars a month is
access to, if nothing else,

00:54:13.784 --> 00:54:17.721 align:middle line:84%
primary care through our nurse
practitioner line, for instance.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:21.692 align:middle line:84%
If someone does need something
on the acute level, you know,

00:54:21.692 --> 00:54:24.194 align:middle line:84%
check out or swab the throat to
see if it's a strep going on,

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:26.229 align:middle line:90%
a person can get that attention

00:54:26.229 --> 00:54:28.265 align:middle line:84%
from a nurse practitioner
on our network.

00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:31.201 align:middle line:84%
And then have the prescription
call then or written

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:32.569 align:middle line:90%
up for them right there.

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:33.737 align:middle line:90%
And this is done in the home--

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:34.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:35.238 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: -- to a large degree.

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:36.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, yes.

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:37.908 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to when you're
feeling sick, drag yourself

00:54:37.908 --> 00:54:40.010 align:middle line:84%
down to waiting room and sit
there for an hour or two.

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:41.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: And it-- But then

00:54:41.078 --> 00:54:42.546 align:middle line:84%
if they don't use
it, that's the thing.

00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:44.314 align:middle line:84%
Then the following
month, they can roll it

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:47.050 align:middle line:84%
over into something else in
one or the other providers

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.785 align:middle line:84%
or practitioners
on our network--

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.053 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So if you
need chiropractic?

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:52.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: If they wanted,
say, they get this problem

00:54:52.189 --> 00:54:53.924 align:middle line:84%
in their neck and they don't
want to take pain medication

00:54:53.924 --> 00:54:55.826 align:middle line:84%
for it, they can get
an adjustment for it

00:54:55.826 --> 00:54:59.629 align:middle line:84%
or get some type of mouth
shutter release or proactive,

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:01.698 align:middle line:84%
wonderful, you know,
body work done

00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:05.168 align:middle line:84%
to correct the problem
without an aspirin.

00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:07.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And then if someone
says, "OK, I'm going for it.

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:09.506 align:middle line:84%
I want to spend, you
know, 300 dollars a month

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:11.141 align:middle line:90%
on a service like this."

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:13.543 align:middle line:84%
What could someone
like that get?

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.178 align:middle line:90%
What would they be entitled to?

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:17.314 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: They would have
access to greater number

00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:20.050 align:middle line:84%
of practitioners in the network
and for them and their families.

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So maybe
you can do a couple

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:23.587 align:middle line:90%
of acupuncture sessions a month

00:55:23.587 --> 00:55:25.756 align:middle line:84%
or you have your
in-house doctor care.

00:55:25.756 --> 00:55:28.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: The hydrotherapy,
they wanted to lose weight,

00:55:28.392 --> 00:55:32.963 align:middle line:84%
quit smoking, reduce their
alcohol intake, use biofeedback

00:55:32.963 --> 00:55:37.567 align:middle line:84%
or hypnosis with a wonderful
network of people that are--

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:38.835 align:middle line:90%
it's growing over the time.

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And this is happening
up all over the country?

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:40.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Well, no.

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:41.938 align:middle line:90%
It's my idea.

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:43.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This is your-- I
mean yours is more refined

00:55:43.507 --> 00:55:45.409 align:middle line:84%
in that way, but there
are concierge services

00:55:45.409 --> 00:55:46.810 align:middle line:90%
that are starting--

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:48.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: The concierge services
are usually going to be doctors

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:50.680 align:middle line:84%
who have active practice
and who no longer want to be

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:53.683 align:middle line:84%
in the medical system-- or the
insurance system I should say.

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:55.218 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to just take
the patients who are willing

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:57.888 align:middle line:84%
to pay-out-of-pocket
for the service.

00:55:57.888 --> 00:56:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, anyone else
who doesn't want to pay

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.192 align:middle line:84%
for it can no longer
use that doctor.

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:04.928 align:middle line:84%
But it's again, you
know, individual choice

00:56:04.928 --> 00:56:08.465 align:middle line:84%
which is really the backbone
of our-- of our society here,

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:09.699 align:middle line:90%
that's individual choice.

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:11.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Rather than
you sitting just insurance

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:14.604 align:middle line:84%
in worse case scenario
where you end up seeing--

00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:16.606 align:middle line:84%
having your seven
minutes with your doctor

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:20.444 align:middle line:84%
if something has gone wrong, you
would have genuine care again.

00:56:20.444 --> 00:56:21.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Care that you want.

00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:23.113 align:middle line:90%
Pay for only what you use.

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:24.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:25.582 align:middle line:84%
I mean I like this
idea personally.

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:26.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Yeah.

00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:27.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I like it a lot.

00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:28.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: If we don't
go this way

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:30.520 align:middle line:84%
in the future then we
can not be successful.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: No, you're
right and there are

00:56:32.022 --> 00:56:33.490 align:middle line:84%
so many other things
that we can even do.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I love all the new technologies,
frequency-based technologies

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.397 align:middle line:84%
and things that are really
helping us keep our own immune

00:56:40.397 --> 00:56:41.765 align:middle line:90%
systems in shape.

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:45.502 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the education-- the
importance of education on all

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:48.205 align:middle line:84%
of this new technology
that's out there is going

00:56:48.205 --> 00:56:51.608 align:middle line:84%
to become more in demand
as a result of this too.

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:52.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: I'm hoping so.

00:56:52.843 --> 00:56:55.812 align:middle line:84%
That's where the smart
money needs to go, you know,

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.147 align:middle line:90%
that's where it should go.

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:59.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We only have a
minute left Carlos, just any--

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:02.219 align:middle line:84%
any kind of final
comment on this?

00:57:02.219 --> 00:57:04.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Most important
thing is stay focused

00:57:04.955 --> 00:57:07.791 align:middle line:84%
and really pay attention
to the big picture.

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:09.192 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Don't freak out if
you get a cancellation notice.

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Don't freak out if you
get a cancellation notice and--

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:14.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There are ways
to take care everything.

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:16.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Santo: Everything
is going to be OK, yes.

00:57:16.233 --> 00:57:18.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah,
yeah, very good.

00:57:18.068 --> 00:57:19.402 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:19.402 --> 00:57:21.605 align:middle line:84%
I really, really appreciate
it 'cause I've been totally

00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:23.540 align:middle line:84%
confused and you've
actually had to dive in

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.275 align:middle line:90%
and start reading the bills, so.

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Santo: Sure.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:28.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I hope we've been
able to give you an overview

00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:30.514 align:middle line:84%
as to what this plan
does and does not do.

00:57:30.514 --> 00:57:34.184 align:middle line:84%
But furthermore, what you can
do for yourself as I see it

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:36.219 align:middle line:84%
that health is our
responsibility.

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:37.787 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this government
intrusion

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:40.824 align:middle line:84%
into our lives will have a
hidden benefit of inspiring us

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.792 align:middle line:84%
to think a new ways
regarding how to care

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:44.661 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves and our families.

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:48.665 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
