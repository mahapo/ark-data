was a heaviness,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA MEREDITH: Today's topic
would take many hours to cover.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.680 align:middle line:84%
It moves far beyond things
that go bump in the night

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to the realms of living in
a multi-dimensional reality

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:90%
on a very personal level.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.070 align:middle line:84%
You're going to meet a woman
whose family lived a nightmare

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:84%
but, ultimately, came
to understand why.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think your
story, your background,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and what happened to
your family is certainly

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
one of more intriguing
stories I've ever come across,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:90%
but it's not just titillation.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
There's meaning behind
every bit of it.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
We will not get to all of
that and the real depths of it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
until our second conversation
in another month or so.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going to dive
in and share with people

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.140 align:middle line:90%
what happened to your family.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's-- I don't know--
with their participation,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:90%
at least on a soul level anyway.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's start about the
surrounding circumstance

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
of your childhood,
where you were, and then

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:84%
this impetus to move to the
country onto a 200-acre parcel.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREA PERRON: Well, it was--
I start Volume 1 of the trilogy

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:84%
of books, "House of
Darkness, House of Light"--

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I start that prior to
moving to the farm.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
everything that happened

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
had to happen precisely the
way that it did in order for us

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to be catapulted into the
environment where we went.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And there were some really
dark and disturbing things

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
that happened prior to
us moving to the farm,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
and it required that, sadly,
in order for my mother to say,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.440 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:90%
No more.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:90%
We're out of Cumberland.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:90%
We're leaving.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:90%
We're going.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go find us
a place in the country.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And yet, she wasn't looking
for it when it came to her.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why I opened
the book with, "This

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:90%
is a cosmic conspiracy."

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about one little
mini-play within this

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that I found so intriguing,
because this name comes up

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:90%
in a big way later on.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the name of
Bathsheba and a dog you had.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Now first of all, I want to say
my first exposure to your story

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
was in the film,
"The Conjuring."

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- I don't
watch those films normally,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
because I don't like
that kind of stress

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:90%
and those images and such.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:84%
However, I was so
intrigued with the story,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and I knew I was going
to be meeting with you.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to say right up
front that certain elements did

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
carry the truth to it in
the film, but a lot of it

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
was skewed for Hollywood's
sake or to protect something.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It was.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.079 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It gave the
general feel of it.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It did.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It was toned
down deliberately

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.800 align:middle line:84%
from what was in the books,
because James Wan wanted

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:84%
a PG-13 rating, and he
still didn't get it.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.930 align:middle line:84%
The MPAA came back and
said, it's just too scary.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not kid stuff, and
it needs to be rated R.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But he had access to
all of the material.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I gave them everything that
they asked for and more,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:84%
but there were things
about that film

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:90%
that it's difficult to describe.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like a little
kiss from heaven on it.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Even though it does not
represent the story,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
even though there
are elements of it

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
that are fictionalized
in the extreme,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:84%
even with that fictional
rendering of the story,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:90%
it's still toned down.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It gives you a
feeling for the experience.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But it does give
you a feel for the experience.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But to think
that's toned down

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:90%
is the kind of surprising part.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, there
was no exorcism.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:90%
My mother was not possessed.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:90%
My mother was attacked.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And Ed and Lorraine
Warren stepped in,

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:90%
and they tried to help.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I give them all the
credit in the world

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
for attempting to bring
our family some peace,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:84%
but their presence really
stirred everything up

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:90%
even more.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going
to go through now

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
that we've brought all this
up and start diagramming what

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
happened, and toward
the end, we will get

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:90%
to the Warren's participation.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.409 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're going to
have to have a second or even

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:90%
a second and third conversation.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So set the background for us
prior to moving to the country,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about
the dog named Bathsheba.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: About two to two
and a half years prior to us

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
moving to the farm, my father
came home with a puppy for us,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and she was the most
extraordinary dog

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:90%
I had ever seen.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I fell madly in love
with her instantly.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:90%
And she was African Basenji.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
They had pointed ears and curly
tails, and they don't bark.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:90%
They yodel.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:90%
And I felt-- that was it.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I was gone.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:90%
I so loved this dog.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:90%
I was devoted to her.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And even though she
belongs to all of us--

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
she was really my dog--
and my mother swept her up

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
into her arms, and she said,
this is a very special dog,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and she needs an
equally special name.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And she just held
her to her bosom,

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and she looked up
and closed her eyes,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and when she opened her
eyes, she said, Bathsheba.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Bathsheba.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I had never heard
that name in my life.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not a typical
dog's name anyway.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
factor in very powerfully,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
because when we start talking
about the entities in the house

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that were already connecting
with you at that time,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:90%
one of them is Bathsheba.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Your mother, she didn't
get it out of nowhere.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Nope.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:90%
She didn't.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't a random
choice, but it was a precursor.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And what you had
said off camera was

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that when that happened and
these other events happened,

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.920 align:middle line:84%
it was clear that
it was preordained

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that your family was going
to have this experience.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It was, and it was
the most innocuous happening.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
My mom took me to-- I played
flute-- my mom took me

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
to a flute lesson, and it
was an hour-long lesson,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
so she grabbed a local
paper and never even really

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:90%
got to read it.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Brought it home that
night, we all went to bed,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:90%
and that was her quiet time.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And she opened up the newspaper,
was drinking a cup of coffee,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and she said it was like the
advertisement for this farm

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
just leapt out of the
paper into her eyes.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:84%
At 9:00 or 9:30 at night,
she called the realtor.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Even in these days, you don't
call people that late at night,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and the woman was very gracious
and made an appointment

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
to show her the farm
the next morning.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
She slipped off without
telling us where she was going,

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:84%
had our friend Kathy come stay
with us while she was gone.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And while she was
there, she looked

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
at this piece of property and
knew that it was her destiny,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:90%
that it was ours.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:84%
She emptied the family bank
account, wrote an earnest money

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
check for $500, left
enough money in the account

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to keep it open and cover bread
and milk until my father got

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:90%
back from a business trip.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
gutsy thing to do.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.409 align:middle line:84%
For just a moment now,
let's backtrack, because now

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
we're going to move toward
your ultimate move-in day.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
What happened with
your dog, Bathsheba?

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I wrote about
Bathsheba in the book,

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.670 align:middle line:84%
but in the film, they have
our family dog dying right

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:90%
after we move to the farm.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I didn't put that in the book.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would be two
morose and that it would scare

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
my readers away,
and they would think

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:84%
this is just going to be one
dead animal after another.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't even
put it in the book.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how the
producers or the screenwriters

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:90%
had that information.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:84%
But another dog died,
beautiful dog Schultz

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:90%
died when we moved to the farm.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's not in Volume 1.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
My publisher wants me to put it
in there so that people aren't

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
confused, but Bathsheba
got killed in my care

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
when we were living
in Cumberland.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
She pulled away from me
and ran across the highway,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and I made the terrible
mistake of calling her back.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:90%
And she always came.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't--

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It put her
in the path of the car.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It did.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
pretty devastating for you.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I know you
can't talk about it.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:90%
And so, OK.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So I understand now
where we're talking

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:90%
about two different dogs here.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to set it
up that it didn't-- the way

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:84%
the movie had played it out,
it's as though the spirits

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
killed the dog the first
day you were there.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It was another bizarre
thing prior to that

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:90%
that had actually occurred.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's move on
now to your mother

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
finally sucks your dad
into the whole dream.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: He wanted to know
how to get the check back.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:84%
That's all he wanted to know--
how to get the check back.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no
money in the account.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And she said,
Roger, I'm telling you

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.090 align:middle line:84%
this is the real estate
deal of a lifetime.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to be
the surrealistic deal

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:90%
of a lifetime.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:84%
But she said, just
give it a chance.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Just come look.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a
big old Bonneville.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we called it the
Catholicmobile-- room for seven

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:90%
and luggage.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And we all piled in,
and we went to the farm

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and met dear old Mr. Kenyon who
owned the piece of property.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to leave.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.410 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to sell it.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:84%
His son was pressuring him
into selling the property,

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:90%
because he was older.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:84%
It was very remote, and he
didn't want to be that far away

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:90%
from his father.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How many bedrooms?

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Nine or something?

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
The farmhouse itself was
more than 200 feet long.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:84%
There were one, two,
three, four, five bedrooms

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.300 align:middle line:84%
after my parents converted
the summer kitchen.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Their bedroom was so active, and
so much was happening in there

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:90%
that they abandoned it.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And my father refurbished
what was the summer

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
kitchen of the farm and
turned that into their bedroom

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.480 align:middle line:84%
about three years
after we moved there.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it was large.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The house itself, the personal
property of the house was what?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Six acres, which is quite a--

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It was 200 acres.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean the six
area-- the walled in area.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: That was
just the backyard.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean
that's what you mow.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Six acres to mow.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Just to give people
a feel of the yard

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:84%
you had to play in
and then, of course,

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
200 acres that went out
into the woods, streams,

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful nature.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Oh, it was beautiful.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your dad
fell in love with it too.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: He did.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
He did against his
own better judgment,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:90%
but he got sucked in totally.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And my parents moved
heaven and earth.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:90%
It was $72,000 back in 1970.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:90%
That was a lot of money.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But 200 acres
and a massive farmhouse.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And a huge
barn, and I mean, it

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.910 align:middle line:90%
was just extraordinary.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful place.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Paradise.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And it took six months.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When was
the house built?

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:90%
This matters.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: The house
was deeded in 1680

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
as one of the pieces of
land, parcels of land

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.590 align:middle line:84%
that Roger Williams
parsed out to people

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
who would come down to follow
him from the Massachusetts Bay

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Colony.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that he did
that was because Connecticut

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
was encroaching from the West,
and Massachusetts Bay Colony

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:84%
was encroaching from
the North and the East.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And the only way for him
to establish his own colony

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
was to parse out
large pieces of land

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
to literally create the
borders of Rhode Island.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And so the Richardson
family got this piece,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and it was thousands
of acres originally.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.330 align:middle line:84%
By the time we bought it,
it was down to 200 acres.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But it was originally surveyed
by John Smith, the John Smith.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And the house, as it's completed
now, was finished in 1736.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So it was, as it stands
now, a true colonial relic

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
completed 40 years before the
signing of the Declaration

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:90%
of Independence.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how long
had Mr. Kenyon been there?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Oh,
decades and decades.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't know exactly how long.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
He married into
eight generations

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
of one extended family that
lived and died in that house

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:90%
prior to our arrival.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.910 align:middle line:90%
We were the first outsiders.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about what happened.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.950 align:middle line:90%
So the day has come.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:84%
The deal has been
struck, and Mr. Kenyon

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
whispers, takes your
dad aside, and softly

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
tells him something, which
your dad didn't exactly

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
tell the whole story to
you right away, right?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he didn't know
what to make of it.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
He really did think it was
just the kindly ramblings

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.800 align:middle line:90%
of an elderly gentleman.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Kenyon took-- it was
an unbelievable snowstorm

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:90%
that day.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.060 align:middle line:84%
It had started to subside by the
time we had unloaded the truck,

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.020 align:middle line:84%
but he took my father out
for a walk on the property,

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Roger, for
the sake of your family,

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:90%
leave the lights on at night.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And my father extrapolated
from that, five little girls,

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:84%
big house new to them, only one
bathroom on the first floor,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and they were all upstairs so
that his little girls didn't

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.500 align:middle line:84%
go tumbling down
these dark stairwells.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what he thought
the warning was about.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
several months

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
later that we found
out from everyone

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:84%
that lived in that community
that there was never

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
a time that they drove
past the Kenyon's place

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that every light wasn't on
in that house all night long.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
held them at bay.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
He never admitted that
the house was haunted.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
he wanted to be

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:90%
thought of as a crazy old man.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Bless his heart.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:84%
He was the sweetest
human being I ever met.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he had
to have been hearing

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.110 align:middle line:90%
things bump in the night.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, he came
to visit, and my mom said,

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Earl, I'm hearing very
strange noises in the parlor.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And he just winked
at her, and he said,

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:84%
swallows in the
chimney, my dear.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Swallows in the chimney.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:90%
In other words, that's it.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
We're not discussing
this anymore.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Now at the same time this was
happening, when they were first

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:84%
connecting with the
house, and your dad

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle line:84%
was starting to fall
in love, your mother

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
was just deeply
overcome with a sense

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
of sadness all of a
sudden out of the blue.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.850 align:middle line:90%
And this was her dream.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.020 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you start
watching the signs,

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
but what would you
attribute that to

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
without any
foreknowledge of what

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:90%
was going on in that house?

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Believe me when
I tell you the last thing

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that any of us thought
was that we might

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:90%
be moving into a haunted house.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:84%
My mother is a brilliant
woman, and she's very deeply

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:90%
immersed in history.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
She reads a great
deal of history.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And for her to get one of the
original colonial homes of New

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.880 align:middle line:90%
England put her over the moon.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Nobody even
considered that there

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:84%
might be immortal characters
that we would be sharing space

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.060 align:middle line:90%
with in the house.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
However, one of the questions
that I get asked frequently

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:90%
is, when did it start?

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Within one minute.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Within one minute.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And now let's start
in-- so you moved in.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with the
phenomena, and let's also

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:84%
talk about the
coldness of the house.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:84%
As you said, it had
been a winter storm when

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
you were there before, but
there was almost nothing you

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:90%
could do to warm that house up.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There's a real
difference between natural cold

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:90%
and supernatural cold.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And even though it's an
old farmhouse and nothing

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
but clapboard, no insulation, it
had a full heating system that

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:90%
seemed to do no good at all.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:84%
All the fireplaces had
been completely sealed up,

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
so there was no
access to a fireplace.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And the day that we
moved in, my father

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:84%
threw open the back of the van,
handed me a very large box,

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and said, take this to
your mother in the kitchen.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I went in through the
closest door to me,

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:84%
which was the parlor
door off the front porch,

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and I took a hard right
into the dining room

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
where Mr. Kenyon was packing up
the last of his belongings out

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:90%
of the china cabinet.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And I saw an oddly
dressed man standing over

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:84%
in the corner near the door,
and I said good morning,

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.590 align:middle line:84%
because I was a well-raised
child and very polite.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And he ignored me
like I was the ghost.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So I kept walking, and
I went to the kitchen,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Mom, who's
the other man with Mr.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Kenyon in the dining room?

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, there
is no other man.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
His son's coming to help, but
there's nobody else with him.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, but-- and
then Nancy walked in.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:84%
No, Christine walked
in with a box.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
were five sisters.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:90%
We need to establish that.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And four of
us saw him that day.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And Christine walks in.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.450 align:middle line:84%
She said, Mom, who's
the man with Mr. Kenyon?

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.870 align:middle line:84%
She said, there's no
other man with Mr. Kenyon.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:90%
And then Cindy walks in.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:90%
She's like, Mom, the man.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:90%
My mother's like, really?

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And then Nancy walks in, and she
said-- she leans over to Cindy,

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and she said, you know
that man in the dining room

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:90%
with Mr. Kenyon?

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:90%
He just disappeared.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.220 align:middle line:90%
But it was chaos in the house.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
There was a caravan of cars,
a moving van, probably 20

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:84%
or 25 people that were
there helping us move in,

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
bringing more things, trying
to get the animals in who

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to have anything
to do with the house.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
The dogs, the cats,
they're like, no, no, no.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And we had to drag
them into the house.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:90%
It was nuts.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
were cowering.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: They were cowering.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:84%
They were crying,
including the dog

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:90%
that we lost two weeks later.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't-- I couldn't
find it in my heart to put that

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:90%
story in the book.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
don't blame you.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It was really tough.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's enough
that's tough in there.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
95% of what happened to
us is in these books.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's 5% that we
have, give or take--

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's no reason.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you get a full
flavor of it with that.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It's just too
personal and too tough.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Now by this time, your
mother and April-- let's talk

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:90%
about April, your little sister.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
She was a beautiful little
blonde thing that just--

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Precious.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She could
see, and she could hear,

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:90%
and she had an innocent heart.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how she
first started experiencing it

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:90%
and your mom.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, my
mother had a sense

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:84%
of sadness that was
overwhelming to her,

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and she did not know
where it was coming from.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I felt it as well, but I didn't
know where it was coming from,

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and I was always the chipper
cheerful leader of the pack.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're the eldest.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: So I had to
keep a stiff upper lip

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and be happy, because
it seemed to help her.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I was always mommy's
little helper.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I was really-- eventually, I
morphed into a third parent,

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.440 align:middle line:84%
because when she
started going downhill,

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
someone had to step up.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And so for all
intents and purposes,

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I helped raise my four
younger sisters in that house.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
But it began happening
with her in a very odd way.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It was more of a sensory
perception of something

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
being around her,
something watching,

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and we all sensed it as well
the second or third night

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:90%
we were in the house.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Cindy, little Cindy,
who was at the time--

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:84%
she's number four-- eight, and
I was 12, came and crawled in.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I was the only one
that had my own room,

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:90%
and I had a big double bed.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And she came into the
bedroom, and she said, Annie,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.400 align:middle line:90%
can I sleep with you tonight?

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, of course.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:90%
I pulled back the quilt.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:90%
It was January.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:90%
We were freezing to death.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Extra body heat
was always welcome.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I'm scared.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what are
you scared about, honey?

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I hear
voices in my room.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, is Christine
talking in her sleep again?

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.330 align:middle line:90%
She's like, no, it's not Chris.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I hear voices, and they're
all talking to me at one time,

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
saying the same thing.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
were they saying?

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There are seven dead
soldiers buried in the wall.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
There are seven dead
soldiers buried in the wall.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've got chills in
my hair when you say that.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Over and
over and over again.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:90%
There was no escaping them.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So now as she turned out to be
the one that also had this very

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:90%
clear connection with them.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:90%
She could see them, right?

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: She couldn't see them.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:90%
She could hear them.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
April did see them?

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But she didn't
hear them audibly.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.120 align:middle line:90%
She heard them from here.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
April developed-- she was
the only one not in school,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:84%
so while we were off, she
was home alone in the house.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And my mother would often
hear her, blah, blah,

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:84%
blah, up in the--
there was a closet

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
between the second
and third bedroom

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that had the center chimney
that came right through it.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was very strange
the way it was.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't actually
supposed to be a closet,

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:84%
but it was large enough that
it would house the chimney,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and then there were
little doors that

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.100 align:middle line:84%
headed off into the eaves
around it on both sides.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was about that wide all
the way around the chimney,

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
but it was warm, and
it was one of the only

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:90%
warm spots in the house.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So April would go in there with
all of her Fisher Price toys,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:90%
and we had the farm.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:90%
We had all the Little People.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:90%
We had Lincoln Logs.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:90%
We had Legos.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And we had this huge expansive--
it was like creativity central.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And we would-- I really
was too old for that,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
but she and Cindy, particularly,
loved to play with the Legos,

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and they would set up the
village, a Little People

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.300 align:middle line:90%
village in there.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And she was in there one day,
and one of the doors opened.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And the eave doors were
probably only about this wide.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
They were very, very
small, and the door opened,

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and she said a little blond boy
with watery green eyes peeked

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:90%
out of the door.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at him, and
she was like, well, hello.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:90%
She was only five.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, children
are wide-eyed wonder,

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and the world is all new, and
everything's a revelation,

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:90%
and she accepted him.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And she said that he turned,
and he looked around.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.920 align:middle line:90%
He looked terrified.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And he looked over his shoulder,
and he looked side to side

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:90%
to make sure that he was alone.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And then he crawled out
on his hands and knees,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and she described
everything about him.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
He had almost platinum blonde
hair, very pale green eyes

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:84%
that looked like he
was always crying,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and very thin little
pink, pink lips.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:90%
But his skin looked pale.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:90%
He looked ill.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
He was probably no more
than five or six years old,

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
which I think is why
he gravitated to her.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And they would play together,
and he identified himself

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:84%
to her as Oliver Richardson,
although he never spoke aloud.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:84%
He always spoke to
her telepathically.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But he would pick up her
toys, and he would hold them.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, he had never
seen anything like this.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And he would take them,
and he would turn them over

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.600 align:middle line:84%
in his hand, and
the Little People

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.100 align:middle line:84%
are all done in primary colors,
the little wooden things.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And he would flip
them upside down,

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and they always had a hole
in the bottom of them,

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and he's looking in the
hole, and she would just

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:90%
let him play with her toys.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And they became fast friends,
but she never told any of us

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:84%
about him, especially
when the Warrens came.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:84%
She was so afraid
they were going

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:84%
to make him go away that she
never told anybody about it

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:90%
until 30 years after the fact.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:84%
But my mother knew
something was going on.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was he the one that
she would play teacher with?

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Or was that a different entity?

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No, no.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I was the one that
played teacher.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I was the teacher.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And we had big,
beautiful chalkboard,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:90%
slate chalkboard that I loved.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It was given to me as a gift
when I was about seven or eight

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
when my parents were both
quite sure that I was going

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:90%
to become a college professor.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:90%
They were sure of it.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I was very intellectually
precocious.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And when we moved
to the farm, we

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
set up the middle
bedroom as a classroom.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of these,
you could flip it.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:90%
It had big solid oak.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move it alone.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I always had to
have my dad's help.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And when we would leave the
room-- and by that time,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
we knew to all travel together,
that nobody-- we knew.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:90%
You didn't stay alone.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: We didn't stay alone.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was wondering,
because I thought

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:84%
it was-- there was a place
where your mother was saying

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:84%
that April was playing
teacher when she was really

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
little over near the
wardrobe, and it never

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:84%
occurred to her that
maybe she was actually

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:90%
talking to somebody.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That could-- she
ahd developed that friendship.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: My mother thought
she was playing teacher,

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.950 align:middle line:84%
or she was playing
Barbie and having them

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:90%
talk to each other or whatever.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
never occurred to her

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:90%
she was talking to a spirit.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't find out about
this until far after the fact.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
You 30 years later
before she really

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:84%
told about how she felt
about this little boy.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It was
the hardest thing

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:90%
about leaving the farm for her.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they were friends.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Now I remember one little bit
as I was going through the book

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:84%
about-- and I think
it was her, again,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.310 align:middle line:84%
but correct me if
it's not-- she was

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
starting to experience things
when she was in bed at night

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.940 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:90%
There was some shaking going on.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And they do depict
this in the movie,

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
but in a little
more violent way.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it actually
happened like that, where there

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:90%
was a tugging on the ankles.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It wasn't
so much that.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
the movie version.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:90%
But her, was the bed shaking?

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.160 align:middle line:84%
It started with
the beds shaking,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and it really, at
one time or another,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:84%
it happened to all of us, but
it happened to Cindy routinely.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And the bed would
start to shake,

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and very often in
the morning, we

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:84%
would all wake up-- my
mother and father included--

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.850 align:middle line:90%
and our beds would be moved.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:84%
They would not be in the
place that they were put.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Every morning we had to put our
beds back where they belonged,

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
whether it was against a
wall, in my parents case,

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
up against two doors that
went to the dining room.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:90%
And there was no explaining it.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Why we didn't discuss it--

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to ask.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Didn't your sisters and
you talk about this?

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We just pushed our
beds back where they belonged.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But didn't you talk
about any of these things?

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Not for--

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The voices
you were hearing?

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, the
girls would come to me.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I, being the eldest sister,
and they trusted me.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
They would come and tell me
what was happening to them,

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.510 align:middle line:90%
but they wouldn't tell Mom.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
they wouldn't tell Mom

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
was because it was
obvious that she was

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.800 align:middle line:90%
having some issues of her own.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
we're going next.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:90%
She had major deterioration.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
What a horrible way
to live for her.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It was.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk
about the progression

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:90%
of what happened to her?

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: About-- well, we
moved in on January 11, 1971,

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
even though we had purchased
the house-- they closed on it

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of December.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.490 align:middle line:84%
But my mother was not moving
her family over Christmas.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Kenyon
wasn't ready either.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So we moved in the
1st of January,

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and the thing that was so
bizarre about that was we

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.050 align:middle line:84%
felt relegated to
playing in the house.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:90%
It was just so cold outside.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:90%
But playing--

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds like
it was as cold inside.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It pretty much was.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:90%
In some spots, incredibly so.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they were accurate
about that in the film

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
about we played hide and
seek, but my mother never

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.850 align:middle line:90%
played with us.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:84%
She was busy setting
up a new household.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So we took care of ourselves,
and we learned very quickly

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that it was much
safer to go sledding

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:84%
in the backyard and crash into
a solid granite stone wall

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:84%
than it was to play hide
and seek in that house.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [laughing]
You know, I get it.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean you were
telling me off camera

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that there were some events
that we haven't talked

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.500 align:middle line:84%
about yet that occurred
that none of you

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
ever went to the bathroom,
for example, by yourself.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:90%
You were always accompanied.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The door was always open
when Dad wasn't around.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.640 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't safe to be
alone in the house.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No, it wasn't.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And it started off slowly.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It started with beds moving a
little bit, and in the morning

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:90%
we'd have to push them back.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
with the bed levitating,

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and then it got
so bad for Cindy.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.860 align:middle line:90%
It really did.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Cindy was the one that
took the brunt of it,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and I think there's
a reason for that.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.330 align:middle line:90%
They left me pretty much alone.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:84%
When I would be approached,
I would tell them, I'm busy,

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have time
for this right now.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I was usually doing
homework or something,

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and they would-- and I felt
very calm and very accepting

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
of them, which is probably
why they did not torment me.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about Cindy?

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, then what was her--

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Cindy died when
she was two months old.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.720 align:middle line:90%
She had major surgery.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.810 align:middle line:84%
She was born with a
horrific birth defect,

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:90%
and they brought her back.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And she came back a very old,
wise soul, and they knew it.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And she was the one
that they gravitated to,

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.240 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't until my mother
opened up the fireplace.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:90%
This house was so cold.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:84%
There really aren't
words to describe it.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was April that my
mother opened up the fireplace,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.460 align:middle line:84%
took a crowbar to the front
of it, and just went to town.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.460 align:middle line:84%
She and April pulled
it all apart one day

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.130 align:middle line:84%
while we were in school,
and when we came home,

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:90%
we helped finish the job.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.760 align:middle line:84%
We had a wood shed
full of seasoned wood

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that was going to waste, because
every fireplace in the house

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:90%
was closed.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know
why, and Mr. Kenyon

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't share with us why
all the house was shut up

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.110 align:middle line:90%
the way it was.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So your mother--

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: That's
what triggered it--

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:90%
when she changed the house.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
One of our neighbors
came over that afternoon,

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and she had brought us a
cake that she'd baked for us,

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and my mom was in the
shower at the time.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I peeked in
the bathroom door.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, Auntie Phyllis is
here-- we called her Auntie.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:90%
And we really took to them.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:90%
They had five boys.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.590 align:middle line:90%
We had five girls.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.930 align:middle line:84%
We lived relatively
close to each other,

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:84%
so it was kind of a meshing
that took place automatically.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:90%
We all rode the bus together.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:90%
We got to know each other first.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And so she walked in
the door with the cake,

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and I peeked in the
bathroom and let

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:84%
my mother know she was
there, and she said, well,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:84%
just make some coffee,
and I'll be out shortly.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And remember how
I told you there

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:84%
was a closet with the
chimney on the top floor?

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, it was
on the bottom floor too.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the chimney came
right up from the cellar.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a room
off the bathroom

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that we called the
warm room, which

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.340 align:middle line:84%
is where we would go change,
because we were freezing

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.710 align:middle line:90%
getting out of the shower.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And my mom went in
there, and there

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:84%
was an old, heavy wooden
coat hanger, several of them

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that Mr. Kenyon had left
behind when he moved.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And she used it
really as a closet.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It was deep, and there
were racks in there.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So the coat hangers were just
laying there unused, and all

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.360 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, we're
all out in the kitchen

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:84%
visiting with our
neighbor, and can't

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:84%
wait to get into the
cake she brought.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we hear
my mother screaming,

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and we all ran
into the bathroom,

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and then threw open the
door to the warm room,

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and stood there,
including our neighbor,

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:39.630 align:middle line:84%
watching my mother be brutally
beaten by this coat hanger.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Just-- I mean, she had bruises
and abrasions all over her neck

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and her head, her chest, and
she was standing there naked.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.720 align:middle line:84%
She had dropped her
robe to the floor,

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:90%
and it was a shocking sight.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can't even fathom.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It was-- I
mean, it was shocking.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, our
neighbor left very quickly,

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and she never came back to
the house in all the years

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.440 align:middle line:90%
that we lived there.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.030 align:middle line:84%
We went to visit them,
but she never came back,

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:10.450 align:middle line:84%
nor did she let her
children come to the house.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this sent your
mother on quite a descent.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It did, and the thing
that was so terrible about it--

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to
talk about this,

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:84%
because this was the beginning
of the end of a marriage.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.720 align:middle line:84%
My father came home
from his business trip.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:90%
He was not a truck driver.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.220 align:middle line:84%
He had his own jewelry
business, a trunk business,

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and he had clients all the
way from Quebec to Ohio

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:84%
to Florida, so he
traveled quite a bit.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And he came home, and my
mother showed him the wounds

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.530 align:middle line:84%
that she had sustained and told
him what happened, and he said,

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
you can understand

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.620 align:middle line:84%
both-- you can understand
his position in that.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I don't.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wouldn't
believe his wife is--

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't seem
congruent to me,

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.460 align:middle line:84%
but that it's so unfathomable
that a coat hanger would

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.470 align:middle line:84%
take off of its own volition
and beat the hell out

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.640 align:middle line:90%
of her is unfathomable too.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But that he didn't believe
her, that was the end of it.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: She would have
swallowed her own tongue

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.310 align:middle line:90%
before she lied to us.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And we were raised-- we
didn't know how to lie.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.270 align:middle line:90%
We were never taught how to lie.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It was unacceptable behavior.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:84%
We learned by osmosis
to be honest children.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your father
didn't know her any better

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.910 align:middle line:90%
than that at this point.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: He did.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:90%
He admits now--

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He just was in denial?

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: He was in denial.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.160 align:middle line:90%
He was king of denial for years.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that is so
frustrating about that

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.960 align:middle line:84%
is that he did know that
she was telling the truth,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and now he admits that he was
so fearful about the fact.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.470 align:middle line:90%
It was back in a different time.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:84%
He was the only
man of the house.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:54.100 align:middle line:84%
There were no male
children, and he

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.470 align:middle line:84%
felt like it was
a situation where

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:84%
he had no control
over the environment

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that he had just
moved his family into.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But he made a very bad
decision in not believing her,

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.990 align:middle line:84%
because then we learned that
we couldn't trust him with what

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.570 align:middle line:90%
was happening with us.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And it wasn't
until June of the first year

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.500 align:middle line:84%
that we lived there
that I went to my mom,

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I have
to talk to you.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you
what's happening.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And it opened the floodgates.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:90%
I went to the kitchen with her.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:84%
We were on the front porch
when I began talking to her,

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.590 align:middle line:90%
and something had happened.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't even remember
what it was now,

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.350 align:middle line:84%
but something pretty severe had
happened with one of the girls,

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and I just knew it was
time to tell my mother.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:84%
This was not something we
needed to keep to ourselves

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.440 align:middle line:90%
any longer.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And we had obviously seen
what had happened to her.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I told her everything
that I knew.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.110 align:middle line:90%
She said, go get your sisters.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't wake April up.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Go get Nancy,
Christine, and Cindy,

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.450 align:middle line:90%
and bring them to the kitchen.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And we had a pow-wow, and it
was full disclosure that night

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.290 align:middle line:84%
till probably midnight or
1 o'clock in the morning.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't disclose to
us what was happening to her,

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.719 align:middle line:84%
but she listened to what
we were telling her.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:16.100 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what she had
already been through a month

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:16.550 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
starting to age.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:90%
She was in extreme pain.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:90%
She was depressed.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: My mother
was drop dead gorgeous.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.150 align:middle line:90%
My mother was model material.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I saw one picture.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:90%
She was.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Absolutely, strikingly
beautiful, and she began to age

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.489 align:middle line:90%
at a remarkable rate.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:38.449 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, she
was only 29 years old

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.199 align:middle line:90%
and had five children.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And when we moved
into that farm,

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:84%
it began taking a toll on her
that was stunning, absolutely

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:90%
stunning.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.760 align:middle line:90%
She began losing weight.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Her skin began to wrinkle.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:01.470 align:middle line:84%
She suddenly, out of nowhere,
a perfectly flawless complexion

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.100 align:middle line:90%
that changed.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.480 align:middle line:84%
She started to look
like someone else.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know
for a very long time

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.740 align:middle line:84%
that there was a spirit in that
house that was, for all intents

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.950 align:middle line:90%
and purposes, oppressing her.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.620 align:middle line:84%
If it couldn't have
the run of her,

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.200 align:middle line:84%
if it couldn't take
over from outside in,

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:84%
it was going to take
over from the inside out.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And so over the course
of several years,

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I had the unfortunate
happenstance

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.380 align:middle line:84%
of watching my mother
be manipulated.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Her voice began to change.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.930 align:middle line:84%
She started using
archaic English words

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:84%
that have been out of use
for hundreds of years.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeoman-- you don't refer to the
men in the villages as yeomen.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But she was doing a great--
she had immersed herself

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the house.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I had talked with her,
and she said, you know,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Annie, if this house
is haunted, they're

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:90%
not just passing through.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
The spirits in this house-- if
there are ghosts in this house,

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:84%
if that's what's
going on here, they're

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:10.080 align:middle line:84%
attached to this property,
and I want to know how.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a scientific
explanation for this.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And so she truly
immersed herself

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the house, everything

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.760 align:middle line:90%
that she could get a hold of.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And when she was finally
approached by the entity

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:26.180 align:middle line:84%
itself, where do you
want to go with that?

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go ahead,
and explain it.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
It was just really-- it's
worse than most horror flicks.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I don't know how
they could create it with CGI.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Any of what's in these
books, I don't know how,

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.450 align:middle line:84%
which is why they opted
to do what they did.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So are you talking
about Mrs. Arnold?

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So tell us who Mrs. Arnold is,
the uniqueness of Mrs. Arnold,

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and Mrs. Arnold's feelings
toward your father.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I have to back
up just a little bit.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.800 align:middle line:84%
The reason that
Bathsheba Sherman

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.470 align:middle line:84%
was accused of being
the malignant maleficent

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.970 align:middle line:84%
entity in the house was
because Mrs. Warren said so,

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.970 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean
that it was Bathsheba.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:84%
We are pretty certain
that it wasn't.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean she
was a lovely entity

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.230 align:middle line:84%
by any stretch of
the imagination,

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and I know that
there was contact

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:90%
in connection with that house.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
We only got bits and
pieces of the history,

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.320 align:middle line:84%
but we got bits and
pieces of the history

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.580 align:middle line:84%
from a man who knew her
when he was a child,

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.290 align:middle line:90%
and she was an old woman.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.750 align:middle line:90%
So we had firsthand--

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She figures
prominently again in the film.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: She does, but in
terms of the language used

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.920 align:middle line:84%
when this spirit
would communicate,

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Bathsheba did not
die by hanging.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Mrs. John Arnold did.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.430 align:middle line:84%
She hanged herself in the barn
when she was 93 years old,

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and I have to ask myself, what
was-- what was speaking to her?

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's compounded
through generations--

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.110 align:middle line:84%
these beings subject
to these other beings

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:90%
subject to the one before them.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Precisely.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about Mrs. Arnold

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.450 align:middle line:84%
now, because that
was a big event.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I'll do my best
to describe this entity,

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell you how I
know how to describe it.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:90%
I saw this encounter happen.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was asleep.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I opened my eyes in my
bedroom above the parlor,

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.760 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't move at all.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.800 align:middle line:90%
I could not move.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were paralyzed.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I heard
my mother screaming,

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.060 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't go to her.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw happening
with my eyes wide open

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:84%
was this entity who had
literally usurped a solid maple

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.320 align:middle line:84%
dresser and was now
standing right beside her

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.950 align:middle line:84%
in her bed with my father
sleeping right beside her down

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.200 align:middle line:90%
on the first floor.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And I could not go
to her, but what

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I saw from a different--
an alternate perspective--

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:54.670 align:middle line:84%
not as though I was looking at
it through my mother's eyes.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:84%
As though I was up in the
room looking down on it,

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.840 align:middle line:84%
almost like an out
of body experience.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:90%
It floated.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It didn't have any feet.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And it had a long, kind of
grey to brown linen dress,

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:15.690 align:middle line:84%
a very tight bodice, wide
belt, lace around the neck,

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and the head was hanging off the
neck to such an extent that it

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:25.240 align:middle line:84%
looked like it had been snapped,
and then just allowed to fall.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.030 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a
desiccated hornet's nest.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:90%
It had no discernible features.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.200 align:middle line:84%
The eyes were hollow
black sockets.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.870 align:middle line:90%
The nose was two little holes.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Very, very thin lips,
jagged yellow teeth,

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and the head had sprigs of
hair, like wild sprigs of hair.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like it was
covered in cobwebs or something

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:53.890 align:middle line:84%
meshy over it, and the head
was literally hanging down off

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.180 align:middle line:90%
of the shoulders.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was moving closer
and closer and closer

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to where it did not speak to
her during the first encounter.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:84%
She started to back up
and kick herself away

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.950 align:middle line:84%
from this thing that was
coming down over her--

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wasn't she
trying to wake your dad up?

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And she was
trying to wake my father up.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.830 align:middle line:90%
He had long black hair.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:12.910 align:middle line:90%
My hair used to be black.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.410 align:middle line:90%
I got it from Dad.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And she reached over, and she
grabbed a hold of his hair

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and started yanking his
head, took her hands,

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and wound it up into his
hair, twisted it, and started

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:90%
yanking on him to wake up.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And she was quite
certain he was dead.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Quite certain he was
dead, and she was next.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And as it got closer
and closer, she

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:84%
was literally crawling
up the headboard,

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and she was kicking
him and pushing at him

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get him to
wake up to release her

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.990 align:middle line:84%
from this terrible dream
that she was having.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:48.530 align:middle line:84%
She was sure it was
a terrible dream.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And she reached over,
and his back was to her,

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and she pulled the
quilt off of him.

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if fingernails
had just serrated all the skin

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:90%
on his back.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.540 align:middle line:84%
She never touched
his back, and it

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.630 align:middle line:84%
looked like he had
been clawed to death.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And she just screamed.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And when she turned back
around, the entity was gone.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.470 align:middle line:90%
He didn't wake up.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, as I recall
too, it was at that incident

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:17.270 align:middle line:90%
where she said, God, help me.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: God, help me.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't say
anything verbally.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In her mind.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: She thought
she was, but she was not

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.860 align:middle line:90%
actually speaking.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.990 align:middle line:84%
She was screaming
in her mind, and she

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:33.990 align:middle line:84%
was begging God for divine
intercession, immediate.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.990 align:middle line:84%
But I could hear it,
and my mother and I

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.410 align:middle line:84%
are very profoundly
connected, so that that's not

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:41.250 align:middle line:90%
surprising to me.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.670 align:middle line:90%
That's not unusual.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.040 align:middle line:84%
People have that happen
to them all the time.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:84%
But that I was in the room
and that I saw it was amazing,

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and when it was over,
I couldn't move.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I was completely
covered in perspiration.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.140 align:middle line:90%
I closed my eyes.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.470 align:middle line:90%
I said, this has to be a dream.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I closed my eyes, and
I went deeply to sleep.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.440 align:middle line:84%
It was about 5:30
in the morning.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.570 align:middle line:84%
At 6 o'clock, I woke back up,
and I had full use of my body

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:12.530 align:middle line:84%
again, and I hopped out of
bed, and I ran downstairs.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And my mother was
sitting on the loveseat,

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and her hand was trembling,
and she had a pencil,

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.370 align:middle line:90%
and she was sketching something.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And I walked over
to her, and she

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:84%
had a cup of coffee in front
of her on the coffee table.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And I picked it up,
because for some reason,

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.130 align:middle line:90%
my throat was as raw as meat.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:84%
It was like I had been
screaming, and I reached down,

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and I took a sip of
her coffee, and I

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.390 align:middle line:90%
looked at what she was drawing.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that she was
drawing what I had just seen,

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:43.390 align:middle line:84%
and I dropped the coffee
cup, and it went everywhere.

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, my god, I
just saw that happen to you.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:48.900 align:middle line:90%
I saw it happen to you.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And she said, don't talk
about it with your sisters.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up, and the
old grandfather clock,

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:58.370 align:middle line:84%
the wall clock that we had,
had stopped at 5:15 AM.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Every major manifestation
that occurred in the house,

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.910 align:middle line:90%
the clock stopped at 5:15 AM.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:07.290 align:middle line:84%
They all happened
at the same time.

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When your
father woke up,

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and the scratches
were discovered,

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:15.590 align:middle line:84%
what was his perception of
all of this or reaction to it?

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I don't know if I
can say it live on the air.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:19.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Maybe tone it down just a bit.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:23.930 align:middle line:90%
PG-13.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: He came
out of the bedroom.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.770 align:middle line:90%
We were all in the parlor.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.820 align:middle line:84%
My mother had
closed the notebook

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and put it away so that my
sisters could not see it.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And when he came out of the
bedroom, he opened the door,

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and he said Jesus Christ
at the top of his lungs.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that was how we
always considered

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:90%
his exuberant form of prayer.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was just
his favorite swear.

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:51.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said, my back burns.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:57.380 align:middle line:84%
It's on fire, and my mother
immediately went over to him.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want
any of us to see,

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and she thought that
she was dreaming,

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and so there wouldn't
be anything there.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And she took him through their--
she closed the bedroom door.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.150 align:middle line:84%
There was another door on the
other side of their bedroom

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that went into the bathroom,
and she took him in there,

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and pulled the mirror
out away from the wall

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and showed him what
his back looked like.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By this
time, was he starting

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.410 align:middle line:84%
to believe there were
phenomena-- there

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.580 align:middle line:90%
was a phenomenon occurring?

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he
was really in denial.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Complete--

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The man was terrified.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --utter,
total denial, and as

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:35.170 align:middle line:84%
well versed as you are
in paranormal phenomenon,

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:39.010 align:middle line:84%
it is not unusual for the
quote man of the family

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:41.350 align:middle line:90%
to take that tact.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:42.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not unusual at all.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they feel powerless.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.430 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing they can
do to protect their family.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: They feel
absolutely powerless.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
can understand that.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It's fear.

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the most
powerful human emotion.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.030 align:middle line:84%
The only emotion that is
more powerful is love.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to touch on that
in a little bit with something

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Cindy said.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So one of the other things that
was happening in the house,

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:06.790 align:middle line:84%
you said the clocks
were stopping.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was just remembering
in a previous conversation

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:11.830 align:middle line:90%
we had about the radio.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the radio, because
this is stuff out of movies.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's why they
made a movie about it.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, that's
actually in Volume 3,

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:22.970 align:middle line:84%
but, of course, we could talk
for hours and hours about this.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But it was years
and years later-- I

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:29.730 align:middle line:84%
think the Warrens had already
come and were long gone--

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and Mom and Dad went
to a local auction,

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.230 align:middle line:84%
because there was a spot in the
house that just seemed empty.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:37.730 align:middle line:90%
It needed something.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So she bought an old
1920s decorative radio.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It didn't have any guts.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.120 align:middle line:90%
The transistors were gone.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.740 align:middle line:84%
It didn't even have
a plug, nothing.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very
attractive radio.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.540 align:middle line:90%
We still have it.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.750 align:middle line:90%
My sister, Cindy, has it.

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And so they brought
it into the house

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and put it over in the
corner of the dining room

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.090 align:middle line:84%
closest to the fireplace
where the mantle was.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And she had an old
pitcher and bowl and put

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.680 align:middle line:84%
baby's breath in the
top and a pretty doily,

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.140 align:middle line:90%
and it was just decorative.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.770 align:middle line:90%
That's all that it was.

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But every now and then, it
would sing to us, and the song

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:16.980 align:middle line:84%
that it would sing is
"Nights in White Satin."

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this came up
yesterday in a conversation.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Out of nowhere.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Out of the ether.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and I
were having dinner

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:25.120 align:middle line:84%
with Paola Harris,
the UFO researcher,

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.280 align:middle line:84%
who is also a friend
of both of ours now.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And Paola was saying, Regina,
when you go to England,

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.290 align:middle line:84%
would you please give a message
to so-and-so about the song

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:35.790 align:middle line:90%
"Nights in White Satin"?

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And you said, my god, that's
the song that this radio played.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're always
surrounded, of course.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But you
know, it took me years.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.640 align:middle line:84%
It took me decades
to understand.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It would blast
out of this thing.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:50.310 align:middle line:90%
It would clear the house.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Everybody would have to leave.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.730 align:middle line:90%
It was so loud.

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:55.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean hands over the ears loud.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And it would play the song
all the way from the beginning

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.150 align:middle line:90%
to the end.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.570 align:middle line:90%
And then the late lament.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Breathe deep.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.910 align:middle line:90%
The gathering gloom.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Watch lights fade
from every room.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.830 align:middle line:90%
And we thought that was the--

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chills again.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.460 align:middle line:90%
We thought that was the message.

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.500 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the message.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was the message?

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I love you.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to
continue on a little bit

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.550 align:middle line:90%
having to do with your parents.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Their marriage is
disintegrating.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to
the Warrens for a bit,

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:32.140 align:middle line:84%
but, again, we have to
have another one or two

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.100 align:middle line:84%
conversations to pick up on some
of those really large themes

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of love and so forth,
although we are going

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.730 align:middle line:90%
to touch on it in a moment.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So your mom and dad, it's
really disintegrated by now.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:46.070 align:middle line:84%
She's literally losing her
life, and your father's

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:47.200 align:middle line:90%
even scratched up.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.370 align:middle line:84%
He's seen what's
happened to his wife.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:50.740 align:middle line:90%
He's still in denial.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:54.160 align:middle line:84%
At what point were the
Warrens kind of summoned?

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Explain who they are, and
why they were called upon

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.330 align:middle line:84%
or found you, however
that came together.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, we didn't
know who they were,

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know
how it happened

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that Keith Johnson showed
up as a college student who

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:09.970 align:middle line:84%
was doing paranormal
investigation with his group

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Pyro.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.520 align:middle line:84%
He and his brother came with
their group-- just pulled

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.930 align:middle line:90%
into the yard one day.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said to my
mother, you called me.

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:18.980 align:middle line:90%
She said, no, I didn't.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.060 align:middle line:90%
I didn't call anybody.

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.400 align:middle line:90%
I never called anybody.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But spirits are
perfectly capable--

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of making phone
calls and playing music.

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Absolutely.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And morphing voices
and everything else.

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:32.410 align:middle line:84%
A stunning revelation,
let me tell you.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:84%
My mother thought
that spirits were

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.830 align:middle line:90%
unable to hurt a mortal soul.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Another stunning revelation.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Talk about a point of epiphany.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But they showed up
first, and all hell

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.760 align:middle line:84%
broke loose in the house when
Keith Johnson walked in there.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.100 align:middle line:84%
All he did was dare to pick
up a piece of sidewalk chalk

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and draw the sign of the cross
on two screens in a bedroom

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:58.440 align:middle line:84%
window upstairs, and then
the window started slamming,

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and the doors started
slamming, and my sister

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.520 align:middle line:84%
got hit in the head, and
knocked to the floor,

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and they flew down those stairs.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing nobody tripped over
and fell onto the other people.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And he is the one that went
to Ed and Lorraine Warren, who

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.500 align:middle line:84%
were lecturing at Rhode
Island College, where

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.870 align:middle line:90%
he was a student.

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And he told them that we
were in a real predicament.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:24.800 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea
who they were when

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.050 align:middle line:90%
they showed up at the door.

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:29.380 align:middle line:84%
They came the night
before Halloween,

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and I know that the
reason that they did

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.470 align:middle line:84%
was because they thought
closer to Halloween,

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.640 align:middle line:84%
the veil would be
thinner, and they

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.560 align:middle line:84%
had a better chance of seeing
some type of manifestation

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.730 align:middle line:90%
in the house.

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:42.400 align:middle line:84%
What they didn't
realize is that there

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.400 align:middle line:84%
is no veil, that it's the
illusion, not the spirits,

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and that they could have
come to that house any time

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and had the experiences
that they had there.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And when she walked in
that house-- and this

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.740 align:middle line:90%
is how it all started.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.490 align:middle line:84%
This is how the
conjuring started.

00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:59.450 align:middle line:84%
She walked in the
house into the kitchen.

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:01.790 align:middle line:84%
My mother graciously
allowed the men--

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:04.580 align:middle line:84%
they seemed harmless
enough, lovely couple,

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.380 align:middle line:84%
both very intelligent,
very well spoken--

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and Lorraine walked over
to our big old black stove,

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and she put her hand
on the corner of it.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And then she covered her
forehead and closed her eyes,

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and she said, I sense
a malignant presence

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.470 align:middle line:90%
in this house.

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Bathsheba.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's how Bathsheba copped
the blame for everything.

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now let's
just back up a tad.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.280 align:middle line:84%
How many entities were
actually in that house?

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.240 align:middle line:84%
After you did the
forensics on it,

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.660 align:middle line:84%
how many different beings
were you dealing with?

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: That we had
personal contact with?

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.040 align:middle line:90%
At least a dozen.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Some we only saw once.

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I had a very incredible
encounter in that house

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:51.130 align:middle line:84%
with a spirit, who I only
came face-to-face with once,

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:53.340 align:middle line:84%
but she was a mirror
image of myself

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.630 align:middle line:90%
dressed in 17th century garb.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
we're going to talk

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:58.470 align:middle line:84%
about that in our
next conversation,

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.680 align:middle line:84%
because this all
happened for purpose.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It did.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So we have a number of entities,
and backing up also just a tad,

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Arnold had a
thing for your father.

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: She did.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She did want
your mother there.

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:middle line:90%
She did not want competition.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Nope.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I do believe she
presumed herself

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.330 align:middle line:84%
to be the permanent
mistress of the house

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and that my mother
coming in with all

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:28.210 align:middle line:84%
these younguns around her was
presuming to take her position.

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:29.670 align:middle line:90%
And she loathed my mother.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:32.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean she really
worked her over.

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But she had a thing
for my father,

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:35.590 align:middle line:90%
and he was a very handsome man.

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Who could blame her?

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But see, he was alive,
and she was dead,

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and she could not draw
that line of demarcation.

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And when he would go,
she would literally

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.350 align:middle line:84%
cause things--
mechanical devices that

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:50.150 align:middle line:84%
were in the cellar, our
heating unit, our water, phone

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:54.110 align:middle line:84%
lines, everything-- she would
deliberately-- nothing ever

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.660 align:middle line:84%
broke down in that house,
unless my father was home.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So the Warrens, they were
ghostbusters more or less,

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:01.030 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They fancied
themselves ghostbusters.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I wouldn't
even say that.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that they were very
serious-minded about this,

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.960 align:middle line:90%
devoutly Catholic.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.460 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing that my
mother really objected about

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.550 align:middle line:84%
in the film is that
they were portrayed

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:17.550 align:middle line:84%
as the holier than
thou Catholics,

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and so completely ingrained
in the religious aspects

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:26.560 align:middle line:84%
of their teaching and
Ed's work in demonology.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.480 align:middle line:84%
But we were portrayed in the
film as ungodly heathens,

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and nothing could have been
further from the truth.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.860 align:middle line:84%
We were all born
and raised Catholic.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.030 align:middle line:84%
My father was an altar
boy the entire time,

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.870 align:middle line:90%
his entire childhood.

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.120 align:middle line:90%
We were all baptized.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.910 align:middle line:84%
We were confirmed
into the church.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:44.950 align:middle line:84%
My mother converted
to Catholicism

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to marry my father, which
was done back in the day.

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And even though she
certainly didn't

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:55.510 align:middle line:84%
buy into all of the
tenets of the religion,

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:56.670 align:middle line:90%
it was just what one did.

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
wasn't as though you

00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.800 align:middle line:90%
had heathens and Christians.

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No, no, no.

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
Warrens were there.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:04.890 align:middle line:84%
They had a strong Catholic
background as well.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.730 align:middle line:84%
During the time they
spent at the house,

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:09.520 align:middle line:84%
she was the seer,
so to speak, right?

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.350 align:middle line:90%
The more sensitive of the two?

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:14.690 align:middle line:90%
She portrayed herself that way.

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:17.740 align:middle line:84%
She did not describe
herself as a medium.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:21.070 align:middle line:84%
She described herself as
having psychic abilities

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and being very sensitive
to the spirit world.

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.910 align:middle line:90%
And I have no doubt about that.

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe, and I do
believe that she picked up

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.830 align:middle line:84%
on Bathsheba's
energy, but I think

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:33.290 align:middle line:84%
she assigned blame
to the wrong entity,

00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:36.880 align:middle line:84%
because the second time that my
mother was approached-- again,

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.880 align:middle line:84%
in bed with my father, who
was absolutely helpless,

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:44.010 align:middle line:84%
put in some kind of
suspended animation--

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:48.520 align:middle line:84%
this time she was approached
by a spirit who came to her

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and said, 'twas mistress
once afore ye came,

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:54.060 align:middle line:90%
and mistress here will be anon.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.230 align:middle line:84%
We'll drive ye out
with fiery broom.

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:59.110 align:middle line:84%
We'll drive you mad
with death and gloom.

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.740 align:middle line:84%
It took my mother
being hypnotized

00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:04.700 align:middle line:90%
to be able to recount all of it.

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.540 align:middle line:84%
That's when my
father believed her,

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:11.210 align:middle line:84%
when there was no
way this was just

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:12.870 align:middle line:90%
a figment of her imagination.

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Under hypnosis, you can't lie.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:16.920 align:middle line:90%
You can't make anything up.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a little too
late for them by that time.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It too late by then.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:26.010 align:middle line:84%
The breach-- the chasm had grown
so wide, she didn't trust him.

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.310 align:middle line:90%
He didn't believe her.

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:33.770 align:middle line:84%
That culminated in a terrible
division between them,

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.940 align:middle line:90%
and he was gone a lot.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So things actually were
very peaceful in the house,

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.740 align:middle line:84%
even though we had gotten
to a point where we had come

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:44.030 align:middle line:90%
to accept what was going on.

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And we all had our own
personal relationships

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.370 align:middle line:84%
with our own personal
ghosts, so it

00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:54.120 align:middle line:84%
wasn't feeling of being
threatened or being fearful

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.040 align:middle line:90%
so much anymore.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.340 align:middle line:84%
After awhile, you
get used to it.

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and there
was one point in Volume 1--

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I haven't read 2
and 3 yet, which

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I will before we
speak next-- where

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Cindy that
your mother was saying

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:14.350 align:middle line:90%
this godless space.

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Your mother was beside
herself by this time.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And I believe Cindy said
something to the effect,

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.150 align:middle line:90%
no, it's not.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Can't you feel God here?

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:24.740 align:middle line:84%
If God made us,
God made them too.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Now just expand on that
thought from the mouth

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:29.490 align:middle line:90%
of a babe for a moment.

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:31.750 align:middle line:90%
We only have a few minutes left.

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Cindy is a most
remarkable human being.

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wish you could
just have her to talk to.

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:41.880 align:middle line:90%
She would blow your mind.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:47.510 align:middle line:84%
She's so integrally connected,
and I believe the same thing

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that she believes-- that we
lived in the house of the holy

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and that we were really not that
much different than they were.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thing.

00:55:57.770 --> 00:56:01.020 align:middle line:84%
From the age of 12 years old,
when I saw my first full body

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:04.530 align:middle line:84%
apparition and mistook
it for a mortal soul,

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I knew the way that I processed
that information was not

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:09.950 align:middle line:90%
fear-based.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:13.370 align:middle line:84%
What that told me is that I
didn't have to fear death,

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.540 align:middle line:84%
because there's
something beyond it.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.330 align:middle line:84%
That's how I processed
that information.

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I've lived
virtually a fearless life,

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.340 align:middle line:90%
but I don't live recklessly.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I know that life
is very fleeting,

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and it can end in
a split second.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm well aware of that,
but I don't live fearfully,

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:34.560 align:middle line:84%
because I know that everything
that I experience, every book I

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.480 align:middle line:84%
read, every piece of music that
I hear, every person I love,

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:43.020 align:middle line:84%
everything that comes into
my soul will continue on,

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and even though this
vessel will, at some point,

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.150 align:middle line:90%
say, OK, that's enough.

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:48.910 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that's the end of it.

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not ashes to
ashes, dust to dust.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:53.580 align:middle line:90%
That only refers to our being.

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the way Cindy puts
it is you can't really

00:56:56.410 --> 00:57:03.040 align:middle line:84%
kill what's already dead, but
that we are what they are.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.130 align:middle line:84%
We're just in a different
form, or they're

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:07.800 align:middle line:84%
in a different form
than what we are now.

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that
we're all that separate,

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.100 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
essentially immortal souls.

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest chill of all.

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:17.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, the big
chill of the movie.

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And you all learned
it as children.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Children.

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And what greater
gift can you have?

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:27.610 align:middle line:84%
My mom looks back
on it, and she says,

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.570 align:middle line:84%
it was a curse in
some ways, but I

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:33.450 align:middle line:84%
hate to admit how many
blessings came from it.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:37.250 align:middle line:84%
We all feel the same way,
even though Cindy said,

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.620 align:middle line:84%
you know, I wish it had
never happened to me.

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I can't look back and
say it was the best

00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:43.670 align:middle line:84%
decade of my life
the way that you do,

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Annie, but I will tell
you that it changed me

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:49.840 align:middle line:84%
in fundamental ways,
and I will never ever

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.140 align:middle line:84%
think about anything
the same way again.

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.600 align:middle line:84%
See, the thing is we live in
a multi-dimensional universe,

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and that was a portal
that's cleverly

00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.350 align:middle line:90%
disguised as a farmhouse.

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when you are able
to be in a multidimensional

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:07.480 align:middle line:84%
experience, when you cannot
only see what's happening

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:10.280 align:middle line:84%
in your dimension, but you
can also see what's happening

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.160 align:middle line:90%
in dimension around you.

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The greatest review
I got of the trilogy

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:17.450 align:middle line:84%
came from a quantum
physicist, who said,

00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:18.750 align:middle line:90%
this is a masterpiece.

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:21.290 align:middle line:84%
It is empirical evidence
of the existence

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:22.100 align:middle line:90%
of a fourth dimension.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And just as a little teaser
before we speak again,

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:31.510 align:middle line:84%
your mother said
to you, ultimately,

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I think it was because of
you that we had to be there.

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into that
part of the story next time.

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, there's one question
everybody is wondering.

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Why in the world did your
family stay in that house?

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Because
we were supposed to.

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I
mean, I get that.

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.240 align:middle line:90%
We get that.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.820 align:middle line:84%
But on a just every day
walking around level,

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.450 align:middle line:84%
wasn't there some point at
which your mother said, Roger,

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:56.700 align:middle line:90%
we've got to get out of here.

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Oh, she
said that right away.

00:58:58.030 --> 00:58:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.200 align:middle line:90%
But why did it never happen?

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it just no one
really followed through?

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.080 align:middle line:84%
There was no initiative to
really seriously get rid of it.

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There were no
laws on the books that

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.750 align:middle line:84%
would protect a family
moving into a haunted house.

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:10.840 align:middle line:84%
There are now, but
there weren't then.

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Our attorney tried to get us
out of the deal within a month.

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.010 align:middle line:90%
My father said, absolutely not.

00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We just invested everything
that we have into this house.

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember,
1971, '72 was

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.400 align:middle line:90%
when our economy tanked huge.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was losing
property value every day.

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to look
at a house and say--

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you couldn't.

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.070 align:middle line:84%
They really, practically
speaking, couldn't get out.

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: They couldn't
without decimating

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.860 align:middle line:84%
our family financially,
which was a consideration.

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.450 align:middle line:84%
When you have five
little children--

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And you little kids loved
playing out in the forest.

00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah, and we loved it.

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:42.700 align:middle line:84%
We said, Mom, they're
not going to hurt us.

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:43.750 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:44.580 align:middle line:90%
We'll be all right.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.460 align:middle line:90%
We'll get through it.

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.750 align:middle line:90%
We didn't want to leave.

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.330 align:middle line:84%
We begged, we whined,
we cried every time

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:50.550 align:middle line:84%
she slammed her hand
down and said, that's it.

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:52.050 align:middle line:90%
We're selling this damn house.

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:54.590 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, we love it here.

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And we did have a little
bit of a democracy going.

00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Even though we
were children, she

00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.260 align:middle line:84%
did listen to our
point of view, but we

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.680 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what she was
going through at the time

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.230 align:middle line:90%
when that was happening.

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And by the time the Warrens
came and the seance happened,

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.270 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't an exorcism.

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.940 align:middle line:90%
It was a seance.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And there we go.

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:15.110 align:middle line:84%
In our next conversation,
I'm writing down a seance.

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: OK, write
down the seance.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
I have to say--

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: That's in Volume 2.

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --we're only
about 2/3 of the way.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.750 align:middle line:84%
This conversation is about 2/3
of the way through Volume 1.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:26.080 align:middle line:90%
That's as far as we've gotten.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.120 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more to
share and so much more

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.130 align:middle line:84%
depth and richness of your
understanding of life.

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:32.340 align:middle line:90%
There were UFOs there.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
to this story.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There's
a lot more to this.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So until
next time, thank you so

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.090 align:middle line:90%
much for sharing this with us.

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Oh,
you're very welcome.

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.760 align:middle line:84%
