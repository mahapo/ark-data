00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Never before
have the words good and evil

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:10%
so dominated our
common vernacular.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
But in times of
extreme transformation,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:10%
it's inevitable that
this polarized language

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:10%
would start surfacing.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:84%
The movement toward
transhumanism

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:84%
is drawing up these
words front and center.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:90%
So what is the evil component?

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:10%
Gregg Braden is
here with us today

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:10%
to share his new book,
Pure Human, with us,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:10%
and dive into the agenda
of what many of us

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:10%
would consider to be pure evil.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, Gregg.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:10%
Haven't seen you in a while.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:10%
>> GREG BRADEN: Regina, it
is so good to be with you.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm so excited to have
this conversation.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Me too.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>> BRADEN: It's a dance.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to follow
your lead wherever

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:90%
you like this dance to go.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, yeah.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm an Argentine tango dancer.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:10%
We have to follow
the guy, so we're

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.045 align:middle line:10%
going to switch back and forth.

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: And we'll
do it really well.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, we will.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about, first of all,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
when you were going through this
and putting some notes together

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:84%
for your media
tour on this book,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:84%
there was one big question right
at the top, and you say, that is

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:90%
what is missing from our story?

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:90%
So let's start there.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Regina,
it's fascinating.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.823 align:middle line:10%
I have traveled the world
over the last few years.

00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:23.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm not traveling
internationally right now.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:10%
Everywhere I go, people
are saying to me, Gregg,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:10%
isn't it a coincidence
how all these things

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.062 align:middle line:10%
seem to be happening
all at the same time?

00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:10%
Whether we're talking about
climate change or social change

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:10%
or economic collapse, family
collapse, all of these things,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:10%
isn't it interesting how
synchronistic everything is?

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
What's missing in our story
is that those changes are not

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
There is a process that we're
in that very few people are

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.135 align:middle line:90%
comfortable talking about.

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm comfortable
and so are you, so let's talk.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: The
process has structure,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:90%
has a beginning and has an end.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And it actually goes back
into some of our most ancient

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and cherished spiritual
traditions, Regina.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:84%
We are casualties of an
ancient struggle that

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
began long before first humans
ever appeared on this earth

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:90%
if you're to believe the text.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But struggle began
in another realm.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the struggle between what
we call light and dark or better

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:90%
known as good and evil.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we talk
about good and evil,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.662 align:middle line:84%
I was born and raised
in the Midwest.

00:02:25.662 --> 00:02:26.620 align:middle line:90%
We used to talk about--

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:84%
we joked about the
little red devil

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
on his shoulder
and the angel here,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:90%
and that was the good and evil.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:90%
This is not a metaphor.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Good and evil is very real.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's playing out
in many ways that are

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:90%
deceptive in our world today.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And it is underlying
so many of the changes

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing in
our world, in general.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:10%
There's a concerted movement
now to combine, to merge--

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:10%
is the term that's being used--

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:10%
our physical reality,
our physical world,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:10%
all the resources, all
the animals, the oceans,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle line:10%
everything, to merge that world
with our digital world, which

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:10%
has been going on
for a long time.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:84%
The new component is the
effort to merge our biology

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:84%
into this massive,
data-driven, AI-managed system.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And the endpoint for that
has been stated very clearly

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.882 align:middle line:84%
through whether we're
talking about the United

00:03:19.882 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Nations and their
Sustainable Development

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.525 align:middle line:84%
Goals, the WEF, or many of
the governmental agencies

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
right now, the policies
are being written,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:90%
the laws are being enacted.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.090 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at
2030 as the date

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to have this merger
accomplished.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.953 align:middle line:90%
The only way that can happen--

00:03:36.953 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and this is the first time
in human history, Regina,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:90%
this is happening.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.050 align:middle line:84%
The only way that
can happen is if we

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:84%
change our biology to meet
the needs of that outer world.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Always in the past,
we've changed the world

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:90%
to accommodate us.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Now they want to change us.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:10%
They want to replace our
natural biology with synthetics,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:10%
computer chips in the brain,
AI, chemicals in the blood,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:10%
RFID chips under the
skin, nanosensors

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:10%
running throughout the body.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And the implications
of that fall

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
into what we are now
recognizing as this conflict

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:90%
between good and evil.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:84%
The foundation of
the conflict is

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
the term-- let me use the
term and we'll define it.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:90%
It's about human divinity.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And we hear the word divinity,
it means different things

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.478 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you're using
a very specific definition.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Well, this is
a contemporary definition.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are surprised by this.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Divinity is the
ability, our ability,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
to transcend
perceived limitations.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:90%
So let's break this down.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:10%
Transcend means to become
more than perceived--

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:10%
suggests that we're living
limitations-- aren't even real.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:90%
They're not even ours.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
They're limitations that
we have been indoctrinated

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:84%
to accept through family,
community, society, religion,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:90%
obsolete science.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Those limits are what
free us from fear.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They free us from
illness and disease.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Our expressions of divinity--
imagination, creativity,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
innovation, empathy,
sympathy, compassion,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
the ability to love
fearlessly, the ability

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:90%
to forgive without expectation.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
These are all expressions
of human divinity.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So now, the goal of
the ancient battle

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:90%
is to deny human divinity.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:10%
And the process that's
unfolding is the replacement

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:10%
of our natural biology
that prevents us

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:10%
from accessing that divinity.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well said.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all feel
the impact of it already.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to-- before we
go to this next question, Lee

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:10%
Harris and I did a book
called The Future Human, where

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:10%
the Z's talked about everything
having to do with our future.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:10%
And I asked them a lot of tough
questions, but one of the things

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:10%
that I was surprised at
and found very interesting,

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:10%
they said AI has visited
your planet many times.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.800 align:middle line:10%
It's throughout the cosmos, but
never with a dense population,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:10%
with this kind of challenge of
decisions that have to be made.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Our world is being
prepared for this shift in what

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.122 align:middle line:84%
many people are now
calling The Event.

00:06:15.122 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:10%
Depending on who
you talk to, there

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:10%
are different definitions
for The Event.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.157 align:middle line:90%
But The Event, 2030--

00:06:22.157 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that what you're
referring to as the Great Reset

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.247 align:middle line:84%
because everyone's
confused on that?

00:06:26.247 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I thought it was just the
economy they were talking about.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: So here's where
it gets really interesting.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
World Economic
Forum, since 1971,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:84%
has had a vision for
what they believe

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:90%
our world should look like.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
They have every right
to have that vision

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:84%
because they had no
ability to implement that

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:90%
until the year 2019.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
2019, the WEF signed
formal documents

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:90%
with the United Nations.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:10%
And the Sustainable
Development Goals, SDG 2030,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.890 align:middle line:10%
the 17 goals that they want to
have developed by the year 2030,

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:10%
those two organizations
are now working together

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:10%
to implement those goals.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at those
goals, on the outside,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:90%
they're beautiful goals.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Who wouldn't want them?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Food security, the end of
poverty, global health.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, look at the fine print.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And how they propose to achieve
those goals is horrendous.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
transhuman movement comes in.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:10%
So they just finished-- this
is early 2025 right now,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:10%
and they just finished
their most recent meeting.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:10%
And they reiterated
in one sentence,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:10%
the goal is, by the year
2030, to merge our digital--

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:10%
and then there's a long
pause in the statement

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:10%
and then they say, and
our biological worlds

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:10%
into one massive database
driven by an AI that is already

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:10%
being developed right now.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So what would be the
problem with that?

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.462 align:middle line:90%
It is human divinity.

00:07:54.462 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go back.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
This is the missing piece.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
The goal of evil in this
world, in a very real sense,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.740 align:middle line:84%
is to deny human divinity,
to deny our ability to love,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
to heal, to innovate,
to create, to imagine.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
These are the very
qualities that we

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
cherish as humans
that set us apart

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:90%
from every other form of life.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:90%
This is the fundamental goal.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So now, what we have for our
community, for our viewers,

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:84%
this is very powerful,
we have a benchmark.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
How do you know when
something is evil?

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Anything that
denies our divinity

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is an expression of
evil in our lives.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:84%
There's technological evil
replacing our biology.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:90%
There is psychological evil.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:90%
There is social evil.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:84%
The lies and the
algorithms that divide us

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
as families, communities,
societies, nations.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Evil.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: These are
all expressions of evil.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:90%
And what's so interesting?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Read the ancient text.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Read the Gnostic texts.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:90%
They're very clear about this.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the kind of
evil that you fight.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:10%
The old idea of conflict
is force against force,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:10%
and that's what keeps us stuck
in this ancient battle that's

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:10%
been going on.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:10%
This battle, we
don't want to win.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.280 align:middle line:90%
We want to triumph.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Triumph is different
than winning.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The way we triumph, if the
goal is to deny our divinity,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:84%
to deny our ability to
love and heal and innovate

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and create and
imagine and forgive,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:84%
then we live the best
version of our lives.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:90%
We live our humanness.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And by virtue of doing that,
we have triumphed over the evil

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.363 align:middle line:90%
without having that conflict.

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.720 align:middle line:90%
They say rise above, literally.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.208 align:middle line:90%
Transform to the state above.

00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Precisely, and that's
precisely what is happening.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's so funny because
I never in my entire life really

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.575 align:middle line:84%
ever used the word evil
until just about the timeline

00:09:38.575 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about, just
really two or three years ago.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, no,
something's happening.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.657 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling the presence of
it very clearly defined now.

00:09:46.657 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Regina, it ebbs
and flows throughout history.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But this fundamental
struggle has

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:90%
defined all of human history.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And what a lot of people are
so conditioned to believe

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:84%
is that humans are
flawed as a species.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We're teaching this to our
young people that we are flawed.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Among our flaws are
things like human emotion

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.205 align:middle line:84%
that cloud our decisions
and our judgment.

00:10:09.205 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
teaching our young people.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:10%
Because we're flawed, we're
teaching our young people--

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:10%
and you and I are conditioned to
accept this as well--c is that

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:10%
we need something outside
of us to be the best version

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:10%
of ourselves.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.940 align:middle line:90%
It makes us victims.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:90%
We need a savior.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:90%
That savior is technology.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So technology is being
touted to everyone,

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
but the young people are so
vulnerable because they've never

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
seen a world that doesn't
have the struggle that we're

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:90%
seeing right now.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So they're more
vulnerable and they're

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:84%
more open and more susceptible
to accepting a computer

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
chip in the brain so they
can play Grand Theft Auto

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.298 align:middle line:90%
with no keyboard and no cables.

00:10:47.298 --> 00:10:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or one in the arm,
so you can go to a bar and just

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.737 align:middle line:90%
ring up the tab.

00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Yeah, the RFID, so
that's exactly what's happening.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.743 align:middle line:84%
So where this gets really,
really interesting--

00:10:56.743 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of these things have
been happening for a long time,

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
but they're coming
to a focus now,

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
because we have an
expiration date.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
2030 has been-- now,
I don't know that it's

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.543 align:middle line:90%
January 1, that per se.

00:11:06.543 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Time frames
are shifting right now,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
because things are moving
so fast, so roughly around.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.418 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: It's in--
they have earmarked,

00:11:12.418 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and there are cosmological
reasons for that.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
There are astronomical
reasons for that.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:84%
There are ancient civilizations
have pegged the year

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:84%
2030 in their calendars
hundreds of years

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
ago as being a
time of this shift.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:10%
So the event of 2030,
what we're seeing

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:36.120 align:middle line:10%
are the nations of the world and
the power structures jockeying

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:10%
to be in the best
position they can be in,

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:10%
when this event unfolds
to accomplish that.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
They need to have the biology
of every human part of this.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't coming
from a place of fear.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a place of recognizing
what's happening.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's another piece,
the flip side, the new science,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:10%
the new discoveries
are telling us

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:10%
we are absolutely not
what we've been told.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:10%
We're so much more than
we've been led to believe.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And there are
extraordinary potentials

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
that we have yet to tap
within us as a species,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:84%
that we stand to lose,
Regina, because when

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
we replace our natural biology
with synthetic technology,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
the natural abilities
begin to atrophy.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And the science
is very clear on.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Let me just give-- may I--

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.753 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: --give
one example of this?

00:12:28.753 --> 00:12:31.273 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, back in
the '50s, '60s, and maybe you

00:12:31.273 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:90%
remember this as well.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
We were always taught
we come into this world

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:84%
with a fixed number
of brain cells,

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and every time
you drink a beer--

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You lose
one or two down.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: --glass of wine,
you're going to lose some.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:10%
And that was the
leverage in college

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:10%
so that people wouldn't drink.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we know
that's not true.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:84%
That's not a reason
to keep drinking.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But what we know is there's
a part of the brain that

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:84%
will continue to
produce these new brain

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.330 align:middle line:84%
cells until the last
breath that we take.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
catch, and the catch

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
is why I'm sharing
this with you.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:10%
The catch is this--

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:10%
unless those brain
cells are engaged

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:10%
in a meaningful way
within about seven days,

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:10%
about a week, they
will atrophy and die,

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:10%
because the body feels that
because they're not used,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:10%
they're not needed.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:84%
All right, that
principle applies

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:90%
to the entire human body.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:90%
It applies to our immune system.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It applies to our
reproductive system.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
It applies to
everything in the body.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:84%
When we replace natural
biology with synthetics

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and artificial
technology, our body

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.030 align:middle line:84%
begins to atrophy,
those very systems

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and those abilities
that are being

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:90%
replaced in one generation.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:10%
Next generation, through
epigenetics, the body

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.800 align:middle line:10%
says, oh, yeah, you
know, we used to do that,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.758 align:middle line:10%
but we don't need to
anymore, because now we've

00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:47.677 align:middle line:10%
got a chemical giving us
immunity to whatever--

00:13:47.677 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Our DNA has adjusted.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Yeah, precisely,
all of these things.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:90%
This is how you lose a species.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
This is precisely how
you lose a species.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you and I
are 100% on the same page.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And from what you've
been talking about,

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I have thousand different
directions we should go,

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.033 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just going to bring
up a couple of things.

00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at WEF
and what you just told me.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Klaus is stepping down, and now
we have someone just marvelous

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:90%
taking his place.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.762 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:14:11.762 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Well, the proposal, I
don't believe it's happened yet.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:84%
The person who has,
essentially, been the confidant,

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and he has had the ear of
the WEF, is Yuval Harari.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:10%
He's a historian.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:90%
He is a technologist.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.397 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He's a transhumanist.

00:14:27.397 --> 00:14:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: He is
definitely a transhumanist.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:84%
He very famously said-- he said
that humans are hackable animals

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:90%
is the term that he's using.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they're saying
that, they're now looking at--

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:84%
when you are working
with computer code, when

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:84%
you can change the
code that determines

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
the output for a program,
that is called write--

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
W-R-I-T-E-- write
level permission.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:10%
He's saying we have write
level permission for human DNA.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:10%
They know just enough to be able
to tweak that DNA for an outcome

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:10%
without understanding
the implications--

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.177 align:middle line:10%
or if they do understand
the implications--

00:15:03.177 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Because it's actually
advantageous to their agenda.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: To whatever it is
that they are they're looking

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:90%
at right now.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:10%
So this is why the relationship
between the United Nations

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:10%
and the WEF is so concerning.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:10%
The UN is not what
it used to be.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The UN has been
hijacked, and I've

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
lost a lot of friends
talking about this.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You can talk.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Well, I think it's
something that we need to be

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
aware of, not to be angry
about and not to be afraid

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:90%
of, in kindness.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I think in kindness, what
we're-- this is why I spoke

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:90%
about the good and evil earlier.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:10%
This isn't something
necessarily that we

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:10%
have to fight against when we
live, when we make the choices

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.450 align:middle line:10%
and live our humanness.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:10%
Buckminster Fuller
said this the best.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're never
going to change the world

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
by fighting against the
things you don't like.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:84%
He said if you want a new world,
find a way that works better,

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
that makes the
old ways obsolete.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:90%
People will follow the new way.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
When we live the truth
of our humanness--

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And the new discoveries
now are telling us

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.500 align:middle line:90%
how to do this, Regina.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.927 align:middle line:84%
They're telling us that
every cell in our body--

00:16:10.927 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:90%
we talk about this a little bit.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.645 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in the body has an
electrical potential, 0.07--

00:16:15.645 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I wrote
all this down,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
because I just love
this part of the book.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: Well, this is--

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
a great reminder.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.150 align:middle line:10%
Go through it, write down to
how many batteries it takes,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:10%
how many football fields.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.410 align:middle line:10%
Tell everybody this.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: I'll just back
up about a half a sentence.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: What's changed
is, in the old days,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:84%
we used to think of biology
as sticky, wet, gooey,

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:90%
mushy stuff inside the cells.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And we learned about
it in a biology book.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:10%
All that changed
about six years ago,

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:10%
and not many people
were talking about that.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:84%
The scientists that
are in the know

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:84%
are now looking at this
biology from an IT perspective,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
information technology, not
sticky, gooey, wet, mushy stuff,

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
but how well we are able to
massage information systems.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
We are literally
a soft technology.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
We are a highly advanced,
technologically sophisticated

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:90%
soft technology.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:16.565 align:middle line:84%
We were given the abilities
that we have, 200,000 years ago,

00:17:16.565 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:84%
through a process that we
haven't even talked about

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:84%
in this conversation, but we
know we're not the product

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:84%
of natural random
mutations in biology.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.310 align:middle line:84%
There was an intelligent
intervention.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Scientists know that.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:10%
They look at human
chromosome number

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:10%
2 is the flagship example
of why that happened

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:10%
or chromosome number 7.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:10%
So it's beyond the scope of
what we can do well here, I just

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:10%
want to say.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in other words,
saying a few hundred thousand

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:84%
years ago, there was
a hack, and we were--

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: We were given--

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.512 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --given, yeah.

00:17:42.512 --> 00:17:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: --given the gifts of
these extraordinary potentials

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.460 align:middle line:84%
that were only
beginning to understand,

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to awaken those
is actually the core of some

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.450 align:middle line:84%
of our most ancient, cherished,
and mysterious spiritual

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because if you
listen to anyone in the field

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of esoterica, from
hundreds of years ago,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years ago to
today, they would say, well,

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.850 align:middle line:84%
what are you essentially
comprised of?

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And they'd say, light.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: Yeah.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.297 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So let's go back.

00:18:05.297 --> 00:18:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: So, this is it.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So the average human has about
50 trillion, give or take--

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
50 trillion cells
in the human body.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those
cells, literally-- this

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.260 align:middle line:84%
isn't a metaphor--
literally, is the equivalent

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:20.070 align:middle line:84%
of a microcircuit, a
nano circuit, almost.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It is the equivalent
of a gated circuit.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:90%
You have an input.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:90%
You have an output.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:84%
There are components within
the cell that do all the things

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:90%
that a circuit does.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:10%
We have components
in our cells that

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:10%
are the equivalent of
transistors, of resistors,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.840 align:middle line:10%
of capacitors.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.723 align:middle line:90%
And I'm smiling--

00:18:34.723 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Transferring of
some information is astounding.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Well it
is, I'm smiling.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I did this with a group
recently, a live group,

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.755 align:middle line:90%
and they were very young people.

00:18:41.755 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:84%
When I say young, they were
in their teens and 20s.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What's a transistor?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.063 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: And I had pictures
of transistors, resistors,

00:18:47.063 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and capacitors.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what are those?

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the next picture
was a microcircuit.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.197 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh,
we know what that is.

00:18:53.197 --> 00:18:55.687 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, all of
these now fit on that micro.

00:18:55.687 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK, I'm with you.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:57.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you now.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But that happened
just in our lifetime.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:90%
That's how fast.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't stop there.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Because every cell emits
photons, particles of light.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:10%
Every cell receives
photons, particles of light.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Light is information.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So we are constantly
in dialogue,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:84%
in communication with one
another in the world around us.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:84%
We may not know
what we're saying,

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:84%
but we're sending
that information.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Every cell stores information
and retrieves information, just

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.632 align:middle line:84%
the way we do on
a computer chip.

00:19:24.632 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to share
a couple more of these,

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:90%
because it's a mind blower.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
The DNA in the
nucleus of every cell

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
holds a record of every
successful genetic transaction

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:90%
of our entire species.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, listen to the words
that are being used.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:10%
That record is transparent.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:10%
It is immutable,
and it's secure.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:10%
And if that sounds familiar
to any of our viewers,

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:10%
it's because those are exactly
the terms being used to describe

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.955 align:middle line:10%
blockchain technology.

>> REGINA: Bitcoin, yep.

00:19:54.973 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Bitcoin was the
first example of the blockchain

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
technology, because that
external technology is built

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:90%
copying--

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
It mimics what we
already do in our bodies.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:90%
All of the external technology--

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I worked in the defense
industry during the Cold War

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:15.180 align:middle line:84%
years, Star Wars Defense, SDI,
Star Wars Defense Initiative.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.308 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I saw some of
the most advanced technology,

00:20:18.308 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:90%
that this world has ever known.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.017 align:middle line:84%
And Regina, I'm
going to tell you,

00:20:21.017 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:84%
I have yet to see anything
built out there, that

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.173 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mimic what we already do
in here, except we do it better.

00:20:29.173 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Let me give another example.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The scientist recently
compared a human brain

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:90%
to a microprocessor.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, I love this.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: When
people say, well,

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.363 align:middle line:90%
how do you make that equivalent?

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:39.340 align:middle line:90%
This is pretty cool.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.660 align:middle line:84%
They determined that the
average number of synapses

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, the place
between the neurons, where

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
we see that little spark jump,
the number of those synapses

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
happens to be about the number--

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:84%
same number of
transistors that we

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:84%
have on our most
advanced microprocessors.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So they're calling
those the equivalents.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:10%
And the bottom line,
what they found

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:10%
is that the brain processes
hundredfold more efficiently

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.500 align:middle line:10%
than the best computers.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:90%
But listen to this.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I love technology, and
computer chips, they are fast.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:90%
They are efficient.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Are they scalable?

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:84%
A computer chip can only
scale to the level--

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:84%
It's limited by the physics
of the stuff it's made of.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So if the silicon
chip, the information

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
can only move between those
silicon atoms, a certain rate,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:84%
so we say that it is
finite in its scalability.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, look at a human neuron.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:90%
What is our scalability?

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
is, we don't know.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Because every time scientists
push a human brain,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and they push those neurons
to what they have accepted

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:90%
is the limits in the past--

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We exceed it.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: We do what humans
do, and here's the reason.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:84%
This is what makes
us so different.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
We morph, and we adapt
to the new condition.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And we open an entire
new vista of potential.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And we do it again
and again and again.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.328 align:middle line:90%
What is our scalability?

00:22:01.328 --> 00:22:02.495 align:middle line:90%
The answer is we don't know.

00:22:02.495 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We don't know.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to go nerd out, go
back on the amount of wattage

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.130 align:middle line:90%
that we create.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: Sure.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm going to nerd out
on it because I wrote this all

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:90%
down from your book.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.285 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you talked
about 3.5 trillion--

00:22:14.285 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Thank you for
reading my books, Regina.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I read every word--

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.820 align:middle line:84%
3.5 trillion volts
of electricity.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And it says here, it takes 8,078
12-volt car batteries to fill

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:90%
a football stadium.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:84%
It takes 371,000 of these
stadiums full of these

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.274 align:middle line:84%
batteries, to match the voltage
potential of one human being.

00:22:36.274 --> 00:22:37.316 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: The potential.

00:22:37.316 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
voltage potential.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a potential, right?

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.597 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: So where did
that number come from?

00:22:42.597 --> 00:22:45.438 align:middle line:84%
50 trillion-- the average 50
trillion cells, 0.07 volts.

00:22:45.438 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:84%
They say. well, that's not
very much, and you're right.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:90%
But you do the math.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
0.07 times 50 trillion
is 3.5 trillion volts

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:90%
of electrical potential.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:10%
What if we could apply
that to our immune system,

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:10%
or to our intuition, our deep
intuition, or to resilience,

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:10%
or longevity?

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:90%
And we do all of these.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And this is the point--

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
the goal of evil is
to deny our divinity.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Our divinity is the ability to
awaken every one of the things

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about now.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:84%
When we lose our
divinity, we become

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.040 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable and
susceptible to the ideas

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:90%
and the agendas of others.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:90%
We're still alive.

We are no longer innovating.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer
accessing the ability

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:84%

for our own immune response

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%

Psychology Today
published an article,

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.007 align:middle line:84%
young children-- so for
example, three years old,

00:23:42.007 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:84%
these kids have breakfast,
and their parents

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.007 align:middle line:90%
sit them in the living room.

00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
They put an AI
visor to keep them

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
entertained for three
hours a day, every day.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And they began--
over time, they began

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:84%
to see what was happening
with these children.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:10%
What they found was
that, first of all,

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:10%
their bodies were diminished
physically, because they're not

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:10%
using them, obviously.

>> BRADEN: Compared to
other children their age,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:84%
their cognitive abilities
were diminished.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Their ability, their
communication abilities,

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
their problem-solving
abilities were all diminished.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about
what's happening.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:21.205 align:middle line:10%
They're witnessing the AI, and
they're seeing colors and scenes

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:10%
It's all being done for them.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.720 align:middle line:84%
There is no imagination that's
being used, no creativity.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:84%
They're observing, and that
was reflected in the study,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
part of their brain

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.440 align:middle line:90%
that was actually enlarging.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.390 align:middle line:84%
The visual cortex is
actually thickening,

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.280 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
part of the brain

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that they're using, while
all of these other abilities

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:90%
are atrophying.

the good news, through

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:10%
And you can brush your own
teeth, and brush your own hair,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.580 align:middle line:10%
and feed yourself.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:90%
What a beautiful thing.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the proposals are to
integrate these technologies,

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:84%
not one off as needed, but
for all newborns everywhere

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.697 align:middle line:90%
to create this--

00:26:35.697 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and this is what they're saying.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:84%
It has to be adopted by
everybody, or it won't work.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:10%
This world that's
envisioned, it won't work,

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:45.170 align:middle line:10%
unless everyone adopts
these technologies.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:10%
So my goal, twofold.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:84%
My goal in writing and
having these conversations

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:90%
is the very least--

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.873 align:middle line:84%
invite a deeper appreciation
for what it means to be human

00:26:57.873 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and for our humanness.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.248 align:middle line:10%
And maybe even one
step further is,

00:27:00.248 --> 00:27:03.470 align:middle line:10%
I was hesitating, not
just an appreciation,

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:10%
but a sense of pride.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm deeply proud of
our human species

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and what our
potential is, and we

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.400 align:middle line:84%
stand on the verge of giving
it away before we even know

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:90%
what we're about to give away.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to happen
20 years in the future.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.420 align:middle line:84%
It's right now, because the
laws are already being written,

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
the policies are already
being implemented.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And we need to wake up to
the deep truth of who we are.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:84%
There's something so precious
and so ancient and so sacred

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and so beautiful inside of each
of us, Regina, that it is worth

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
the powers that be to go
to the extremes that are

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.160 align:middle line:90%
going to deny us that power.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
That tells you how not
just valuable, precious,

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.380 align:middle line:84%
sacred this essence is, that
we're about to give away.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:57.188 align:middle line:10%
And for me, that inspires me
to advocate for our humanness.

00:27:57.188 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:90%
I think we're worth preserving.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I
couldn't agree more.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And the book I referred
to earlier, what we did,

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:84%
The Future Human, they
talked about this one thing,

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:84%
the thing that ultimately
will separate us from anything

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:90%
that they attempt to do.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with--
you mentioned it earlier--

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:16.150 align:middle line:84%
this capacity for the heart
energy, the heart intelligence,

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:84%
love, and to be able
to run the greater

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:23.950 align:middle line:84%
mind through the heart, which AI
will never be able to imitate.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have the
capability to do that.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Well AI cannot
access human divinity.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, it cannot.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: So what
a lot of people,

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:36.270 align:middle line:84%
the disconnect is that people
rarely link divinity to biology.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:40.530 align:middle line:84%
We can only access
our divine potentials

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:84%
through the DNA in the
cells, in our bodies,

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:90%
if we don't have healthy bodies.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't have a full
complement of neurons and cells

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and DNA, we can't access--

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.140 align:middle line:90%
We're still breathing.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.850 align:middle line:84%
We can still follow
instructions.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:90%
We can still be worker bees.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Where's the imagination,
the creativity?

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Where's the empathy, the
sympathy, the compassion,

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:90%
the forgiveness.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:90%
AI will never do that.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.110 align:middle line:90%
So let me--

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.693 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They can
try to imitate it,

00:29:05.693 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:90%
but it can't actually do it.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: Exactly.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a
peer-reviewed journal.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It was the Journal of
Alternative and Complementary

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.167 align:middle line:84%
Medicine, and the
statement was that--

00:29:15.167 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do
this from memory--

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.740 align:middle line:84%
there's compelling evidence to
suggest that the human heart is

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:84%
coupled to a field of
information that is not limited

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:90%
by the laws of physics--

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.957 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: --that is not
bound by space and time.

00:29:28.957 --> 00:29:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's correct.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.133 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Now we know, 1991,
40,000 specialized cells,

00:29:35.133 --> 00:29:37.050 align:middle line:84%
sensory neurites were
discovered in the heart.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:38.630 align:middle line:84%
These are brain cells,
but not on the brain.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:90%
They're in the heart.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:43.940 align:middle line:10%
And these neurons, you can
think of them as antennae,

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:48.530 align:middle line:10%
and they are literally tuned
to a place in the field that

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:10%
underlies all existence.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:84%
They're tuned in a way that
gives us access to information.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why remote
viewing works.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:90%
I tell a story in the book.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.760 align:middle line:84%
A mother in Brisbane,
Australia, woke up at 3

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:84%
o'clock-ish in the morning,
sensing that her son

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in the battlefield, in the
Middle East, was in trouble.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.857 align:middle line:84%
She called his
commanding officer,

00:30:08.857 --> 00:30:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and they said, no, he's on
a routine patrol, no trouble

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:84%
She knew before the CO did
that her son was in trouble,

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, his convoy
had hit a series of IEDs.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And the vehicle in front of
him had been directly hit.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:10%
He was thrown out of his
vehicle, but he was alive,

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.300 align:middle line:10%
and he was able to work and
pull the others from the burning

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:10%
vehicles and save them.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Then, he called his
mom, and his mom

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and his wife, who were living
in the same house together.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we've been
praying for you since 3 o'clock

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
how did you know?

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I had a feeling.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.677 align:middle line:84%
Now, the new studies
are showing--

00:30:47.677 --> 00:30:48.760 align:middle line:90%
and this is a mind blower.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.230 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't know this.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:10%
When a woman conceives, in
her womb, whether it comes

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.280 align:middle line:10%
full term or not, doesn't
make any difference,

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.680 align:middle line:10%
her blood is moving
through that fetus.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:84%
The fetus blood is
moving through her.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what the new studies,
the science is showing,

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:09.660 align:middle line:84%
is that the baby's DNA will
lodge in organs of the mother's

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.700 align:middle line:90%
body, specifically the liver.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And the mother's DNA will
lodge in her child, either

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:84%
male or female, and now that we
know that the DNA, literally,

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:90%
is an antenna.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It means that we are in
energetic communication

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.290 align:middle line:90%
through the DNA with our mother.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:31.120 align:middle line:10%
That's where the
intuition comes from.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And it also helps
us to understand

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.500 align:middle line:84%
when we lose our parents, or
when a parent loses a child,

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and we say it
hurts, it literally,

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.830 align:middle line:84%
what we're describing is
the feeling of the severing

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:84%
of the energetic connection
that we have known,

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.720 align:middle line:90%
has become so familiar to us.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the loss of that connection
that creates the hurt.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:51.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm hesitating.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:90%
I lost my mom to COVID.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I remember, and
I lost my father shortly

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.380 align:middle line:90%
thereafter.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.970 align:middle line:84%
You came in here, I think,
just a few days later.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I came in here a few
days after my dad died.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.063 align:middle line:90%
We both were going through this.

00:32:04.063 --> 00:32:04.863 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: We were.

00:32:04.863 --> 00:32:05.875 align:middle line:90%
I remember that, Regina.

00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
I'm bringing it up

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.710 align:middle line:84%
now is because I went to the
ER twice with chest pains

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:90%
when my mom passed.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Both times, they said, Mr.
Braden, why are you here?

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.757 align:middle line:84%
You are in excellent physical--
the doctor came in and said,

00:32:18.757 --> 00:32:19.590 align:middle line:90%
he ran all the test.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.430 align:middle line:90%
He was busy.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.768 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're in excellent
physical condition.

00:32:22.768 --> 00:32:24.060 align:middle line:10%
He said, it's all in your head.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.583 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, well,
I'm feeling something.

00:32:26.583 --> 00:32:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the nurse came
in, and the nurse

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
did something the
doctor didn't do.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.390 align:middle line:84%
She said, Mr. Braden, what's
happening in your life?

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.587 align:middle line:84%
And I started to say,
I'm losing my mom,

00:32:37.587 --> 00:32:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't even
get the words out.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- and I
wasn't even crying.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:41.720 align:middle line:90%
I was sobbing.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said, that is
a somatic response.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:84%
She said, you're dealing
with unresolved grief,

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and the grief, actually, it
cramps the little muscles

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:90%
around the heart.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to
tell that you're not

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.200 align:middle line:90%
having a cardiac event.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:90%
She says, you're not.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:10%
I went to grief counseling
twice and resolved that

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:10%
and never had to
think about it again.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:08.270 align:middle line:84%
But that is how powerful
this connection is between.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, we went back, and we said
a lot of the new discoveries,

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:84%
they're published in these
obscure technical journals.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.060 align:middle line:90%
They're not in biology books.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.750 align:middle line:10%
So there is a journal
of soft computing

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.420 align:middle line:10%
that just published an
article, and that literally

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:28.900 align:middle line:10%
says that human DNA functions
as a fractal antenna, tuned

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:10%
to wavelengths and
frequencies that were only

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.450 align:middle line:10%
beginning to understand.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, what a fractal--

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.020 align:middle line:84%
an antenna tuned to a
signal, we know that.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.080 align:middle line:10%
Fractal means that
antenna is tuning

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:46.090 align:middle line:10%
to an array of many signals
across a broad bandwidth.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.620 align:middle line:90%
We're in this communication.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why our intuition
with one another works.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.052 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
remote viewing works.

00:33:53.052 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different way of
thinking about the human body,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and we stand to lose all
of it through this process.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Human is really
going to start ramping up

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.550 align:middle line:90%
in our abilities.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It's coming online much
more rapidly, I think,

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.200 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
start rising above what

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.830 align:middle line:90%
we're being positioned against.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:11.489 align:middle line:84%
And so these things
don't happen randomly.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:13.500 align:middle line:84%
It's no surprise that a
much larger percentage

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.870 align:middle line:84%
of the population is starting
to wake up to their intuition.

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And even Hollywood is starting
to mimic all these themes

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.830 align:middle line:90%
of governmental manipulation.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: Sure.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.389 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Nothing
is as it seems.

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Well, it's showing
up in the entertainment.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:31.489 align:middle line:84%
There is a theory out there
now, a view of our reality,

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that says consciousness informs
itself through its creations.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:41.239 align:middle line:84%
So when we see movies of
young people wakening up

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:44.659 align:middle line:84%
their superpowers or
movies, like Avatar,

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.360 align:middle line:84%
reminding us our relationship
to the natural world

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:84%
or The Matrix that says
there's a world we can't see,

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that influences the
world we can't see,

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and we live in
both those worlds.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.410 align:middle line:84%
The theory says that's
us, a part of us,

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
asking ourselves to create
what we need to see and hear

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and smell and sense and taste to
remind ourselves of who we are.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.400 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's no accident.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.590 align:middle line:84%
All these series and
films are coming out

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.720 align:middle line:84%
about investigative
reporters, who are doing it

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:90%
all from intuition and all--

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, I love it.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: --or
something like that.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.828 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is being
reflected back to us,

00:35:22.828 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:90%
and we are co-creating that.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So now, we only
have a few minutes

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:90%
left, six or seven minutes left.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
we start disengaging,

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.400 align:middle line:84%
because right now,
we're to the point

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:38.150 align:middle line:84%
where most of the people I know
are now engaging with ChatGPT,

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.653 align:middle line:84%
They're letting it
write copy for them.

00:35:40.653 --> 00:35:42.320 align:middle line:84%
They're letting it
do creative projects.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Kids are letting it do homework.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, that is--

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: The Grammys--

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.910 align:middle line:84%
this came up in the Grammys
because the Grammy music

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:52.630 align:middle line:84%
was competing against people
who had spent their lifetimes

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.260 align:middle line:90%
mastering these instruments.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.760 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what's happening.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now, you get to
be King of the world for a day,

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to choose how
we start interfacing with this

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:05.620 align:middle line:84%
stuff, because that is going to
begin very rapidly atrophying

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.910 align:middle line:90%
the creative capabilities.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.368 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: Well,
you just asked me,

00:36:08.368 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:84%
if I were president
of the world,

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.350 align:middle line:84%
first thing I would do is, I
would bring these world leaders

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:84%
together, with no armies
and no technology in a room,

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to look one another in the eyes
and talk about our children

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and say whatever time we
have left in this world,

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:90%
how much good can we do?

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:27.730 align:middle line:10%
How far can we take this world
and the people that trust

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:29.270 align:middle line:10%
us enough to put us in power?

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.687 align:middle line:10%
That's the first
thing I would do.

00:36:30.687 --> 00:36:33.330 align:middle line:10%
When it comes to the
technology, it's not

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.750 align:middle line:10%
right or wrong, good or bad.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.860 align:middle line:84%
We are learning to
allow the technology

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.620 align:middle line:84%
to serve us rather
than enslave us.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
is the technology

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:middle line:84%
has advanced faster than the
morality of how we implement it

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.460 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're playing a
game of catch up.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.335 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So
where do you start?

00:36:51.335 --> 00:36:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Average household,
You've got kids.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.092 align:middle line:90%
They're on their devices.

00:36:54.092 --> 00:36:55.925 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know they know
they don't even have

00:36:55.925 --> 00:36:57.160 align:middle line:90%
to do their homework anymore.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.630 align:middle line:84%
They can have something
else ready for them.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Where do you begin?

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.543 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: I think it
goes deeper than that.

00:37:01.543 --> 00:37:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I think we owe it to
the younger generation

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to instill within them a
sense of pride and value

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.680 align:middle line:84%
for their humanness,
for who they are,

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:14.890 align:middle line:84%
that there's something inside
of them that is so rare,

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and it is ancient,
and it is precious,

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and it is beautiful that
is worth preserving.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody's telling
our young kids that.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:84%
They're telling them
that they're flawed.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.270 align:middle line:84%
They need something
outside of their body.

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.687 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That their mere
presence is killing the planet.

00:37:27.687 --> 00:37:30.225 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: All right, so
by virtue of being carbon,

00:37:30.225 --> 00:37:32.100 align:middle line:84%
that carbon-based life
is killing the planet.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Killing the planet.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: When we begin to
instill these values within

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:84%
our young people, what comes
with that is the appreciation

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.930 align:middle line:84%
for our own imagination,
our own creativity.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And we feel less of
an urgency to use

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:52.310 align:middle line:90%
ChatGPT and things like that.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because we are
unique in and of ourselves.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: That's
where I would begin.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Parents, right now, I know
it's a very different way

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I think, obviously,
we all know to limit

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
the use of how these things and
to regulate how these things are

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:08.970 align:middle line:90%
being used in our lives.

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:14.580 align:middle line:84%
But if we go to the core of the
problem, then it solves itself.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:10%
When young people develop that
sense of appreciation, of pride

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.680 align:middle line:10%
for what it means
to be a human life

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.750 align:middle line:10%
and the extraordinary
potentials,

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:31.030 align:middle line:10%
that they see on those movies,
they have within themselves,

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:35.180 align:middle line:10%
then they are focused
on developing those.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.960 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel the need to
have something do it for them,

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:84%
because they know the most
precious thing, Regina, is it

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.540 align:middle line:90%
all comes down to love.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And what we're asking
ourselves, as a society,

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and what we're asking
our young people,

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
do we love ourselves enough to
accept the deep truth of what

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.430 align:middle line:84%
it means to be human
and the responsibility

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.030 align:middle line:90%
of human divinity?

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Do we love ourselves
enough to accept it?

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.220 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is not verbal.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.748 align:middle line:84%
It's the way we live our
lives, the choices that we

00:39:03.748 --> 00:39:03.820 align:middle line:90%
make with our lives.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree with that.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: And that's what I
think we're really talking about

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.830 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think so too.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.492 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go
back for just a moment

00:39:09.492 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:90%
to the world of entertainment.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.953 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, when
kids are being bombarded

00:39:13.953 --> 00:39:15.370 align:middle line:84%
with all the Marvel
movies, you've

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.910 align:middle line:90%
got some pretty dark characters.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:17.993 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of violence.

00:39:17.993 --> 00:39:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, there's
someone, there's

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:24.370 align:middle line:84%
some kid, someone that just
has the power to do right,

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and it has all of the
abilities within themselves.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:84%
It has the mental, the
spiritual capabilities.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.030 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, that's actually
positive programming

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.857 align:middle line:90%
for younger people.

00:39:33.857 --> 00:39:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: It is
positive programming.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about the many
ways that evil is implemented,

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.660 align:middle line:90%
there's--

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.810 align:middle line:84%
kinetic evil is on
the battlefields.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:44.550 align:middle line:84%
In the entertainment
industry, there

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:48.370 align:middle line:84%
is an effort to normalize
evil in our lives.

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and
that's not cool.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:52.328 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: No, I mean, if you
want to see a perfect example

00:39:52.328 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:84%
of that, you look at the
Grammys a couple of years ago

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and the concert that
happened during the Grammys.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.630 align:middle line:10%
Sam Smith, who was
doing that concert--

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.660 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if I can say
that-- but it was there,

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of people
were really upset.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it was-- although
they said, this is art,

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:18.900 align:middle line:84%
it very clearly portrayed the
demonization and the denigration

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:25.440 align:middle line:84%
of women, and the upliftment
of evil in our lives

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.280 align:middle line:84%
in a way that was forced upon
the entire global viewing

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:90%
audience that night.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So instead, we can turn
to, perhaps, superwoman.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.740 align:middle line:90%
One thing just as--

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> BRADEN: Gaia TV.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And Gaia TV.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.073 align:middle line:84%
There is this one
comment in the book

00:40:41.073 --> 00:40:43.740 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about earlier, The
Future Human, where they said--

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.932 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, tell us
then, as our senses,

00:40:45.932 --> 00:40:47.390 align:middle line:84%
they said, do you
have an explosion

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.098 align:middle line:84%
of what's going to
happen with the senses

00:40:49.098 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and the extra senses that's
coming in your future.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.480 align:middle line:84%
They're very positive
about where we're headed.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But say, you've
got a tricky time

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to make these decisions right
now, just like you're saying.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
would that look like?

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Can you give us an idea?

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
you have a movie

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.250 align:middle line:84%
called Avatar, where they're
living in complete harmony

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.470 align:middle line:84%
with each other, with
nature, with their food

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.790 align:middle line:84%
supplies and the plant
and animal kingdom.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.730 align:middle line:84%
That's more similar
to where you're

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:90%
headed than anything else.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: That was the highest
grossing box office film

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:21.390 align:middle line:84%
in history, and it
spoke to people.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: And they
didn't know why.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.380 align:middle line:90%
It's because--

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We're going there.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.885 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: --we're
reminding ourselves,

00:41:26.885 --> 00:41:29.440 align:middle line:84%
this is what we are asking
ourselves to remember about

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:29.835 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:41:29.835 --> 00:41:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.093 align:middle line:84%
We're down to a minute or so,
and this has been so wonderful.

00:41:34.093 --> 00:41:35.510 align:middle line:84%
We're completely
on the same page.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: I knew
it would go fast.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:37.558 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, God, it flies.

00:41:37.558 --> 00:41:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Final thoughts,
Gregg, before we go.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> BRADEN: I'll share
my final thought.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:41.990 align:middle line:10%
I think it all
comes down to love.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:10%
Do we love ourselves enough to
accept the gift of our humanness

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:10%
and what it means in our lives?

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.850 align:middle line:90%
I think we're worth preserving.

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:52.737 align:middle line:84%
And this is the generation
where we make that choice.

00:41:52.737 --> 00:41:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I agree, and
we imprint on our children

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:84%
the incredible capabilities,
maybe let them watch Avatar

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.920 align:middle line:90%
and Gaia TV.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.378 align:middle line:10%
>> BRADEN: Well, thank you for
the opportunity to have this

00:42:02.378 --> 00:42:05.250 align:middle line:10%
conversation and for all you do
to keep our community informed

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.050 align:middle line:10%
and in the loop.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:07.370 align:middle line:10%
I appreciate that tremendously.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:08.510 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Thank
you so much, Gregg.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.850 align:middle line:90%
It's good seeing you again.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:12.950 align:middle line:84%
The name of Gregg's new book
again is called Pure Human.

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:16.040 align:middle line:84%
This is something we all need
to engage with, seriously,

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.840 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of
all of our futures.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:90%
