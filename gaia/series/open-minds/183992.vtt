00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Cyndi
Dale is back with us,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:10%
continuing her passion
to help people awaken

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.050 align:middle line:10%
and strengthen their
intuitive abilities.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're
focusing on her book

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:10%
"Raise Clairaudient Energy,"
which follows her book "Awaken

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:10%
Clairvoyant Energy."

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to take us deep
into the clairs, as they say.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And after 65,000
client sessions,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
she has earned her stripes
to tell us all about it.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.610 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:90%
We were talking off camera.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:84%
You have another
book coming out.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited about it.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite here yet,
but you're pretty much

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.298 align:middle line:90%
done writing it.

00:00:50.298 --> 00:00:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I would like to start
the interview talking

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
about the book that's going to
be coming out in a few months,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Little
Book of Empathy."

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI DALE: I would love to.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I bring
it up because we

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:10%
each have such a unique
relationship with empathy.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
sensitives watching this

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
are overly empathetic,
taking on everyone's stuff.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have any notes on
it, because I haven't read it,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.440 align:middle line:90%
because it's not out.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But let's start talking about
what motivated you to write it.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And then later, after that,
we'll get into "Clairaudient."

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I would love to because,
actually, empathy is a clair,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
so we're still talking
about the clairs.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Clairempathy is that
ability to sense

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.730 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in others.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:10%
And not just other people--

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:10%
it can be animals, or
nature, or whatever

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:10%
it is that's around us.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And I, like most
of the listeners,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
have struggled with
empathy, as well--

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
with that kind of over-sponging,
is one of the non-verbs

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.463 align:middle line:90%
that I would use about it.

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even that can
spill into overweening

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of others around you, trying
to protect everybody from ever

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:90%
having a bad day or experience.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so draining.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's exhausting.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, oftentimes,
you lose your own energy.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy, yeah.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Because as you take
on other people's feelings,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
or physical conditions, or
their mental awarenesses,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
or what's happening to them,
or what their needs are,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:84%
then inadvertently
people like us often

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.060 align:middle line:84%
end up giving them a little shot
of energy to keep them going.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent most
of my life-- probably

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
till about 20 years
ago, when I really

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
began to focus on these
empathic abilities and gifts

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and what they really were about
from a psychic and intuitive

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
point of view, not
just from sort of like,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
oh, we're sitting around and
talking and understanding

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.823 align:middle line:90%
each other point of view.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I spent most of my life
just feeling everybody

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:90%
else's everything's.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.403 align:middle line:84%
So I knew when they
were sick, and I

00:02:42.403 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:90%
knew what they were feeling.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I knew if they were
horrified about something.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:90%
I knew what they really needed.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:90%
I knew what they wanted.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It's crazy, because then you
don't get to be yourself.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say,
but did you know anything about

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:90%
yourself--

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No.

[GASPS]

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.923 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and your own energy?

00:02:54.923 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No, no.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to
become yourself

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.545 align:middle line:84%
when you're really sort of
a mirror of everybody else.

00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know, Cyndi,
I've had this conversation

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of people.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Women, almost
exclusively women, share

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that they have this problem,
especially with family

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and when they go
into a relationship.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about really strong,
competent, accomplished women

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.270 align:middle line:84%
in their careers
and chosen fields

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
get into a
relationship, and boom,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
they're spending
all their energy.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.880 align:middle line:90%
It's all going outward.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
It goes to the
partner in their life,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and they can't feel
themselves anymore.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And this actually,
oftentimes, leads

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:90%
to split ups in relationships.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It does, because
you can't be around it.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I have so many women clients who
come to me for something really

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
basic like, I can't sleep next
to my husband, or my partner,

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.945 align:middle line:90%
or my this or that.

00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And it might be
a woman, but they

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.280 align:middle line:84%
might have been the one to take
on the role of feeling it all

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:90%
and working it all through.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And they can't sleep there,
because they're up all night,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
feeling what wasn't felt by
their partner during the day.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know, it's extreme.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's extreme.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: But it's not
uncommon, either.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:90%
And there are some men--

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
my son, my youngest
son, actually.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:90%
He's 20, right now.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:84%
He's one of those
sponges, as well.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I remember forever ago--
he was in the third grade.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:84%
I was in therapy
one day, and I was

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:84%
working on a really deep
issue that was down in my body

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and was really physical.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel
it, and I let it go.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And maybe about an
hour after my session,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I got a call from the
school nurse who said,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
your son has thrown
out his back.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, how can he
throw out his back?

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.242 align:middle line:90%
He's in third grade.

00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:90%
She goes, I don't know.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
He was just sitting
in the school room,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and he said he felt this
pain come into his body,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:90%
and it threw out his back.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:90%
So these are real energies.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Just because they're subtle,
or psychic, or intuitive,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual, or quantum, or
whatever we want to call them,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.810 align:middle line:90%
they physically affect us.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.988 align:middle line:90%
They emotionally impact us.

00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to
change other people,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:90%
so we have to have boundaries.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
For me, that's been the
biggest issue in life--

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
is that I tend to
live in the moment

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:90%
and don't have boundaries.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of other
people are like that.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Women, in particular--
without boundaries.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we walk around
oftentimes drained

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.427 align:middle line:90%
and not feeling ourselves.

00:05:13.427 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Exactly, and
not feeling well.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, not knowing it.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.490 align:middle line:84%
There is one very
interesting study--

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure it's completely
scientifically valid,

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
but it certainly makes sense
to me on a practical level--

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that the auric field, the
field around our bodies

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that extends from our
subtle organs, et cetera,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.535 align:middle line:84%
shares so much between
us and somebody else--

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: --that you can even
take in somebody's nutrients.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Like if your--

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
They showed how
somebody absorbed

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.550 align:middle line:84%
vitamin D. They were low in
vitamin D. Somebody they were

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:84%
near was high in vitamin
D, and they actually

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:84%
temporarily went
up in vitamin D,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:90%
because they absorbed that in.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
actually makes sense.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
These are just fields
of information.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
inner-penetrating fields,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:90%
why wouldn't you?

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're absorbing
other kinds of energies,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:90%
why not nutrient information?

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
fascinating, though.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, Einstein said, "We're just
oscillating fields of energy."

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So we're always just
sort of playing and dancing

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:90%
in each other's fields.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, why is it that
men-- generally speaking--

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
have so much easier
a time of maintaining

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
their own boundaries and sensing
themselves, their purpose,

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, within life?

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I think it
goes back thousands

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:90%
of years to hunter-gatherer.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's much
more complicated than that--

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.130 align:middle line:84%
that our energetic bodies took
a cue, thousands of years ago,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
from our biology,
from how we had

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:90%
to live in order to survive.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And this was sort of post the
goddess civilizations, when

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.640 align:middle line:90%
women were--

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.302 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're a little weaker, so we
guess we have to stay at home,

00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and take care of everybody,
and do the cooking.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you have to collaborate

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:90%
and be in community.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And you
share, and you have

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to know what your children
are going through.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to pick up
on them getting sick

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:90%
before they get sick.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the men are
away on a raid,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and you have to sense if they
are injured so you prepare

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:90%
for when they come back.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And the men-- you can't focus
on feelings, and emotions,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and what somebody
needs when you're

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:84%
out there looking
for the gazelle,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
or when you're fighting
the good fight.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:90%
You have to stay really focused.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the benefit
of, say, ADHD,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.070 align:middle line:84%
with this in a lot
of men and boys--

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:90%
you hyperfocus.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can't deal with feelings,
and emotions, and needs.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:90%
It's all about survival.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's just focus
and keep going.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I think we're just
programmed that way.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:90%
I think that's how we are.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
talk about your book

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and the different
kinds of empathy.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, also, give
us some strategies

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
of how you can create some
kind of energetic boundary

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to at least contain yourself
or not let everything in.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I keep it
simple in this book.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It is called the "Little
Book of Empathy."

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I have one book
that's 1,200 pages,

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.012 align:middle line:84%
and this would not
be a titled that.

00:07:58.012 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So primarily, there's
physical empathy,

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:84%
where you pick up
on what's happening

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:84%
in the physical environment,
or somebody else's physicality.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And so some people are
really naturally based.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
They go out in the
world, and they

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.670 align:middle line:84%
can sense what's happening to
a tree that's being cut down,

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
or their animals are in
pain or wanting to be fed.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm way too
hyperaware of my dogs

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.452 align:middle line:84%
saying that they're
hungry, feeling hungry.

00:08:25.452 --> 00:08:27.368 align:middle line:84%
They're probably not,
but they've just learned

00:08:27.368 --> 00:08:28.618 align:middle line:90%
how to send me those messages.

00:08:28.618 --> 00:08:29.451 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:90%

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're good.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right?

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Feed, feed.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:90%
And I go, OK.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But I know I'm a
physical empathic.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm working with
clients, even over the phone,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
I feel what's happening
in their body.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't own it, though.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I register, but I don't
let it become my energy.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.987 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
you can get sick,

00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:90%
just like somebody's sick.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you don't want
that to become your reality.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.225 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's not my reality.

00:08:53.225 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's just an
energy I'm reading.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's emotional
empathy, which

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:90%
is really about feelings--

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:84%
sensing what other
people are feeling.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Really feeling--
not what they're

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:90%
showing that they're feeling.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:90%
So you know this one, Regina.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.140 align:middle line:84%
When somebody is looking
really happy and pert,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're going, oh,
god, they're so angry.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I know they're angry.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:90%
I just know they are.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Or whatever
the feeling is.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:90%
You know what it really is.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Mental empathy is
harder to describe.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you have the
gift, you get it.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
It's about being able
to pick up cognitively

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:90%
on somebody else's motivation.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody else
is really wanting

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
to have this job rather than
that job, you're going to go,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.532 align:middle line:90%
oh, they so hate their job.

00:09:35.532 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I just know they don't
like what they're doing.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I so know they really want to
be home right now, sleeping,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's about getting a sense
of what somebody is thinking

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:90%
about, what they're aware of.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And spiritual empathy can
also be hard to describe.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But again, if you have this
gifting, you're aware of it.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
You know what that
person's really believing--

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
their professed

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:90%
values and how they're living.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.410 align:middle line:84%
You sort of know what
god knows about them.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.200 align:middle line:84%
You might even be able to go,
they shouldn't be in this job,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and they should be
doing this, instead.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Physical empaths are
physical, obviously.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual empaths
also pick up on what's

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
happening in the
invisible world.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:90%
So when there's entities--

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:90%
dark forces, ghosts, spirits--

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:84%
they're the ones that are going,
OK, this is a really full room.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
There's 42 different
spirits flying around.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you are raised in a
family that doesn't believe

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:84%
in some things like that,
you're going to struggle,

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
maybe even thinking
your sort of crazy.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like you.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I saw spirits.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:90%
I saw ghosts.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:90%
I heard them.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
They talk to me.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:10%
And I just learned
not to talk about it,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:10%
because we were really
Lutheran-- very boring

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:10%
Lutheran.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was boring
Missouri-centered Lutheran,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:90%
too, for 17 years.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, my gosh.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about squashing
the joy out of life--

00:10:57.815 --> 00:10:58.615 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:10:58.615 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and the magic.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, and I could
see fairies, and a lot

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.490 align:middle line:90%
of little happy creatures.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And I knew when
they were around.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And as empaths, we want to
have joy out of our gifts.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able to go,
oh, I can tend to this person

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and speak to their
feelings, but I don't

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:90%
have to become their feeling.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I can just have
compassion for them.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So the tools are,
first of all, being

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:84%
able to distinguish between who
you are and somebody else is.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So I always have
people do that by maybe

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:84%
seven, eight times a day,
affirming who they really are.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:90%
I just call that our spirit.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I am my spirit, you
are your spirit.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a greater spirit,
whatever you want to call it.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And let everybody be
in the right place.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:90%
So I use that tool.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So kind of
claiming your territory.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You claim
your territory.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And secondarily, I always
tell people, claim your body.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Because all gifts-- whether
they're clairvoyant or seeing,

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
clairaudient or hearing,
or clairempathic,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.480 align:middle line:84%
which is what we're
talking about--

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:84%
we can get confused with that
spiritual idea of oneness

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and think that that means we're
supposed to be totally unified

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%
on every level.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:90%
But I'm sorry, this is my body.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:90%
So I want to feel my feelings.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what I think.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:90%
I want to be on my purpose.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to be aware of
if I'm off or not, what

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:90%
my feelings are telling me.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of
just a decision.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:90%
There's not a trick.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just deciding, while
I'm here, this is my body.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not letting
anybody else in it,

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
or anything of
somebody else in it.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
conceptual issue I

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:90%
think, or principle to grasp--

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I sort of also referenced
this a few minutes ago--

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:84%
is that you get to register
this invisible energy

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.140 align:middle line:90%
rather than own it.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So I get to sense when somebody
is going through something.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of like reading it.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
You're letting
the impression in,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
but you're not
bringing the actual--

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Energy.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: --subtle
energy into your body.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's also a decision.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I can read it, or not.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, you just have
to be diligent, like you say.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You have to be diligent.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to
be conscious that this

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:90%
is what you're requiring.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you this.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to ask
your guides, for example--

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:84%
the lovely beings that surround
us, that are our team, right?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Can you ask them to help
you and do this for you

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:90%
in case you keep forgetting?

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yes, yes, and I call
that getting a gatekeeper.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It's even more useful
to have just one

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
guide act as that gatekeeper
and just say, you know what?

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll block it for you.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm your guard, I'm your sentry.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I'll keep it out, and
I'll let you know when

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:90%
you do need to pay attention.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
it's useful to know,

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:90%
this person's about to blow.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.018 align:middle line:84%
We're at a family gathering,
and they're going to yell.

00:13:48.018 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I better know
it, because I think

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to walk out of the room.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:90%
So these are survival skills--

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.080 align:middle line:90%
is to be able to pick up.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:90%
They're connecting skills, too.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really useful
to have a guide helping you,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:05.430 align:middle line:84%
or to get a way to interpret
in your body what's happening.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But one really simple
tool that I, for instance,

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
taught my empathic son is,
sometimes, it's a little late.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of going, OK, I'm
feeling really weird right now.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling off.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Is this my cold, or
somebody else's cold?

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Is this my rage, or
somebody else's rage?

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So I have him-- and
I do this, too-- use

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:84%
the body sort of as
an answer machine

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:90%
and just ask the question.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:35.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, body, if this is my energy,
give me an upward feeling.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:90%
And then, you just feel up.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.268 align:middle line:84%
If this is not mine,
do a downward feeling.

00:14:39.268 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of like dowsing.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: That's it, it's just
like dowsing with your body.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And then,
if it's not yours,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
you just ask whatever you
believe in-- your own spirit,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:84%
a greater spirit,
your guides, whatever.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.880 align:middle line:84%
You can do it just
through willpower.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just, I'm going to
wash out what's not mine.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I always add that,
let it be taken

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:90%
to where it can be useful.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't always
want to send something

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.045 align:middle line:90%
back at somebody.

00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Then, you start a little
bit of a rope fight.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, you do.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:05.995 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:05.995 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right?

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And they might just
get you for that one.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I just say, take it
somewhere where it's useful.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:90%
It can be--

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Decommission
the energy.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.125 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:15.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let it
be used constructively.

00:15:15.855 --> 00:15:16.655 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:15:16.655 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know the old
typical, new-age visioning

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:84%
of the white light
coming through?

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:90%
That's just fine.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
that those ideas

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.590 align:middle line:90%
have been around for decades--

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:90%
because they work.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.615 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, for
thousands of years.

00:15:28.615 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Thousands
of years, yeah.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:90%
They're old age.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:90%
They work.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.177 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's a
couple other useful tools.

00:15:34.177 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:84%
If you find that you're
still sort of struggling,

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I just say, put
mirrors around you.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Put little mica chips in
mirrors, in your energy field.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I often picture them
almost like a pyramid.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
They just bounce off what's not
yours, bring in what you need,

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.287 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But could
they bounce it

00:15:51.287 --> 00:15:52.975 align:middle line:84%
back to the person
that's projecting it?

00:15:52.975 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Pyramid, pyramid.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.312 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a
pyramid won't do that?

00:15:55.312 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Pyramid-- because it
shaped like this, so bum--

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, can't go fff.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: --it goes up,
it goes to the heavens.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a good idea.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.895 align:middle line:90%
That's very practical.

00:16:01.895 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Pyramid, yeah.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
The good thing about knowing
that it's your own issue--

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and, for me, taking
self responsibility--

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
is then I can do
something about it.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, I don't have to
go down that bunny hole

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle line:90%
next time, too.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I can actually change.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right?

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think these
are some wonderful, practical

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:90%
techniques people can use.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I like the idea of
the mirrored pyramid.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And also, I like the idea
of asking guides for help,

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.550 align:middle line:84%
because I tend to be
forgetful about that stuff.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know I won't
do my due diligence

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to say, these are my boundaries,
this is me, this is--

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to end up doing
that, because I'll forget.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: We will,
we know ourselves.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if I can
just put it into place

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, guys, you
know I'm going to forget.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Could you help me out, here?

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I even tell
the guides, if there's

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:84%
something you need me
to know about anything,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty dense.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a human body.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm busy.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing my thing.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably not tuned
in, so just get me

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:90%
the message, however you can.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And they'll get it.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll see four license plates,
I'll get hit on the head

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:84%
with a book-- you know,
the old book technique.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I'll start calling
somebody-- my phone will

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.269 align:middle line:90%
start calling somebody.

00:17:14.269 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:90%
I didn't dial it.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.694 align:middle line:84%
I could be staring
at the phone, and it

00:17:16.694 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
calls somebody who I've sort
of been avoiding, by the way.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So they can
move physical energy.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Physical and subtle
energy aren't that different.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just about density.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.432 align:middle line:84%
And so you can do
something physically

00:17:31.432 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and make a difference
in your life,

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
obviously, even in
the empathic world.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
One really good
trick, if you don't

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.460 align:middle line:84%
want to pick up on what's
happening to somebody,

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
is just cross your
arms over your stomach

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:84%
or put your ankles
over each other,

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:84%
because it closes off the
flow of your energy centers

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and it blocks you off from
what's happening around you.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you
just pay attention,

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.287 align:middle line:84%
when we think about
it, think about how

00:17:57.287 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:84%
our body position
is when we're having

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.268 align:middle line:90%
an uncomfortable conversation.

00:18:00.268 --> 00:18:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Guess what we do?

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
exactly what we do naturally.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right, right.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
interesting, yeah.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.507 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, it's sort of
like what you brought up before

00:18:07.507 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
about couples, where she's
feeling all the feelings

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and saying, no, I know
that you're upset.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I know this.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
I know you didn't mow the lawn.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And he's sitting
there like this--

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
or she is, however it
is our interactions are.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:84%
But the body pretty much acts
out what's really happening.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, it sounds like it's
going to be a lovely book--

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:90%
a lovely, little book.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's a very
little, pocket-sized book.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:90%
You can bring it in your pocket.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.087 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is the one that

00:18:35.087 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
follows the one we're
talking about today.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Also, it's a new book.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with clairaudience,

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
which followed a book
on clairvoyance, as I

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:90%
said at the beginning.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But why did you choose
this particular trajectory,

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and choose the clairs
in a particular order?

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I think-- in
my practice, anyway--

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
the most frequent question I
hear around intuitive giftings

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:84%
are people asking to
become more clairvoyant.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:90%
They want to see.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I wish I could see.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to get psychic sight.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:90%
I want to get images.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:90%
I want to get dreams.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It sounds so glamorous--
and so cool, and so neat--

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that I really thought, OK,
let's just answer to the crowd

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and first write the book about
clairvoyance, or clear seeing.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And I primarily-- in my sessions
with people, I'm clairvoyant.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:90%
I get tons of pictures.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I get colors, I get
pictures, I get the past.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I see what they did
in second grade.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I see their spirits,
or this or that.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's fun.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:90%
I love seeing pictures.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:84%
You get a picture, and it's the
equivalent of thousand words.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
typically find, too,

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
when I'm teaching
clairvoyance, is

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:84%
that people are much
more clairvoyant

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:90%
than they think they are.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
there's different styles.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Like sometimes, you just get
black and white pictures.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's still clairvoyance.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Or you can turn a
feeling into a picture,

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:90%
if you learn how to do it.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.142 align:middle line:84%
Or some people just
get symbols, or colors,

00:20:02.142 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and they don't think
they're clairvoyant.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But anytime you're seeing
somehow, you're clairvoyant.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.555 align:middle line:84%
Or they get a lot of
signs in the environment.

00:20:10.555 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Like they're billboard readers,
and they get all their messages

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:90%
from billboards.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, heck, that's clairvoyance,
because it's imaging.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:90%
It all works.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to clear up some of
the myths and let people know--

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle line:90%
you, too, are clairvoyant.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And this
is how you know,

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is how
you strengthen it.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's a fun topic.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's very
practical, as well.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's really
practical, yeah.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now we're
going into clairaudience.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is interesting, because
there's so much confusion.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.727 align:middle line:84%
It can come from so
many different sources.

00:20:44.727 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
start drilling down

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:90%
into these various areas.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But one a lot of people have,
and they have an issue with

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.420 align:middle line:90%
is whether--

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
it's not tinnitus, it's
just this intense ringing

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:90%
in their head that can cycle up.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It can cycle down,
it can go away.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:90%
It can scream at you.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I think probably a
number of people watching this

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
have this issue, let's
go ahead and talk about,

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:84%
what is this overwhelming
sense of noise that happens?

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: That's
typically clairaudience.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to remember,
with any of the clairs,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:84%
we get the information
at one level or another

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:90%
through our body.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So when we're being
clairaudient--

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.300 align:middle line:84%
let's say we're even hearing
a dead person that's floating

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:90%
around the room--

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.710 align:middle line:84%
in one way or another, we
will hear what they're saying,

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:84%
or get a noise, or some
kind of verbal indication,

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:84%
an auditory indication,
that they're present.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And so clairaudient,
at its baseline,

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.490 align:middle line:84%
works through the throat
chakra and through the ears.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:84%
The bones can convey
vibration, et cetera.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's going to be ear-based.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so there's different
radars, there's

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
different radio stations,
that we get messages on.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And so frequently, when
that gift is opening up,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
or when something or somebody is
trying to communicate with us,

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.770 align:middle line:84%
it might just be one radio
station that goes on.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And it could be the
high-pitched one within us.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And typically, those are more
of the angelic or the higher

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:90%
orders.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.550 align:middle line:84%
The higher the
pitch, typically--

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:21.153 align:middle line:84%
not always, but typically--
the higher the source.

00:22:21.153 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to get through to us.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
how to tune into it.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to really
grab that sound, or the message,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and interpret it
in English words,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
or whatever our language
is, or how to write it down,

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:90%
or how to turn it off even.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a
problem with that.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: We don't
know how to turn off.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't know
how to turn it off.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah, it's hard.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet I'll notice,
with that particular feature,

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
driving through a
particular area--

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:84%
especially moving
through space--

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:90%
then the sound goes [MURMURS].

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:84%
It'll go from high-pitched,
down really low--

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and go
into this hum of sorts.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.573 align:middle line:84%
And you pass through
whatever it is

00:22:58.573 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:84%
you're passing
through-- a space--

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.202 align:middle line:90%
and, whoo, it's way back up.

00:23:01.202 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: All that
means is, when you

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.710 align:middle line:84%
get that lower-pitched sound,
there's a denser vibration.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just more
earthly, or denser,

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:84%
or lower, or more
so-called down to earth.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But it sounds like you
tune into vibration,

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.660 align:middle line:90%
which is what you're hearing.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:90%
It's vibration.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we can
interpret it as words.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's really
just the vibratory nature,

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and we just get
an auditory sound.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:90%
But it can drive people crazy.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I would think it could
drive ear, nose, throat

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:84%
doctors crazy, because
they're not going

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.150 align:middle line:90%
to be able to figure it out.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
can't find the source of it.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They can't
figure it out.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.213 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, I had a
guest here the other day

00:23:39.213 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:84%
who was so heightened in her
awareness before the interview

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that the noise was so loud she
couldn't calm herself down.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very
difficult for her.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.300 align:middle line:84%
We worked together and
kind of got it calmed down,

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:84%
but it was the noise that
was driving her crazy.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:90%
She said, I hope I can hear you.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
I can barely hear through
all the noise right now--

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.143 align:middle line:90%
the sound, the humming.

00:23:59.143 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, my kids have
always been angry with me

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
because when we
drive in the car,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I keep the radio really low,
because I hear other sounds.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So I can't focus and hear
all these so-called inaudible

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.793 align:middle line:84%
sounds that they're not hearing
and have the radio really loud.

00:24:14.793 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're always
like, you're just

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:90%
stressed out in the car.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
there's a lot going on--

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] --that you
can't hear, maybe.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about the various sources.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.580 align:middle line:84%
As you said, oftentimes
high-pitched sounds

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:90%
can be kind of angelic realms.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot
of different sources

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:90%
we're getting information from.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
guides and angels, OK?

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And so how does
that often show up

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:84%
in the form of clairaudience,
aside from high pitches?

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, sometimes
they can just speak.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you might
even hear a noise--

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.462 align:middle line:90%
a banging, or something falling.

00:24:51.462 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, knocking.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, I
get the knocking.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.623 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do, too.

00:24:54.623 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Or just something
that tells you they're

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:84%
in the environment,
or footsteps.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.120 align:middle line:90%
It was sort of funny.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:84%
A couple years ago, when my
youngest went off to college--

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:84%
the dogs and I sleep
downstairs, all right?

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:84%
They're very happy sleeping
downstairs with me.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
We were woken up about
2:00 in the morning

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:90%
with footsteps upstairs--

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:90%
real footsteps.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:90%
I woke up, they woke up.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.613 align:middle line:84%
They looked at me,
I looked at them.

00:25:18.613 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
go see what it is.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.450 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't leave the room.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:90%
They made me go up there.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do your job.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I think it was
my deceased father who

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:90%
was sort of checking in on me.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
chilled with it.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a--

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.243 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or scared.

00:25:32.243 --> 00:25:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: [LAUGHING] I know.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.570 align:middle line:84%
So we can hear
environmental noises.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, we even hear--

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.680 align:middle line:84%
like, the radio will
flip, the real radio.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Or the television might flip.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Or something gets
louder on it, and we

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:90%
get a message in that way.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So they can speak to us
through other means, as well.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Or they speak in dreams.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:84%
They come and visit,
talk to us in dreams.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:84%
They may even-- not in
a bad way, all right--

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.180 align:middle line:90%
take over somebody else.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And the person will just
say something to you.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And you'll go, wow,
that's meant for me.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go, I have
no idea why I said that.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how you're
best to receive it.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:84%
The angel just sort of
whispered in their ear,

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.500 align:middle line:84%
or shoved it through them, and
you get the message, as well.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they really
will just talk, or communicate,

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:90%
or sing a song.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot that's
singing in my mind.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a song will
burst forth, especially when I'm

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:90%
doing sessions with clients.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.145 align:middle line:90%
I'll hear these songs.

00:26:30.145 --> 00:26:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So pay attention.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: To pay attention.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And it will have the message
that the person needs.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember one woman
who really was rather shy,

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and I was checking
in with her guides.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, what does
she need to know?

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And they started
singing, in chorus,

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:90%
"I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar."

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And I just will not
re-sing these songs,

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:90%
because I can't say sing.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But she goes, oh, I get
it, type of a thing.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.230 align:middle line:90%
But they can write.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
clairaudient methods.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.827 align:middle line:84%
There's different
kinds of writing.

00:27:02.827 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:84%
There's what's called automatic
writing, where something

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.812 align:middle line:90%
kind of does it for you.

00:27:06.812 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:84%
There's guided writing,
where you're just

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:84%
sort of kind of in
partnership with a guide,

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:90%
and they write with you.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of ways they
can get to us if we let them.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:90%
We have to let them.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the technological interface

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.770 align:middle line:90%
of Siri.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.883 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, yeah.

00:27:24.883 --> 00:27:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Smartphones.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Where you're just
doing your thing,

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:90%
your phone's on the table.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:84%
It starts recording everything
and talking back to you,

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
touching your phone.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yes, I've
had that happen.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe we actually
have an energetic technology

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:84%
center, at this point,
in our brain that

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:90%
links into technology.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:50.138 align:middle line:84%
So it can get messages to
us, too, including Siri.

00:27:50.138 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it happens
to so many people,

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:90%
which is why I brought it up.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.155 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It does, it's
really common, exactly.

00:27:55.155 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Or she'll just start talking.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, sometimes
it's simple voice recognition.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're saying a word
that has an eerie sound in it.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
goes even beyond that.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.063 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's beyond
that, because the guides

00:28:08.063 --> 00:28:09.513 align:middle line:90%
can reach through anything.

00:28:09.513 --> 00:28:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've touched
on that one for people

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that have their
phone around a lot

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.655 align:middle line:90%
and have had this experience.

00:28:14.655 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Or computers.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
computers-- same thing.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.005 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
guides and angels.

00:28:19.005 --> 00:28:21.255 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go through
the different kind of beings

00:28:21.255 --> 00:28:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that tend to try to
get through to us--

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:90%
deceased humans.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's very common,
it's very frequently--

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like Uncle
Fred, or whatnot.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Yes, exactly--

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.300 align:middle line:10%
Great Aunt Alice,
or whoever it is.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.050 align:middle line:90%
And there's different reasons.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Some deceased humans are
actually sort of stuck.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.080 align:middle line:84%
They haven't
finished their work,

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they just want to
keep guiding, or helping,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
or preventing X, Y and Z from
happening, or whatever it is.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, even when they
more leave the earth plane,

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:90%
they can still visit.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:84%
They may show up to
help, or to assist.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:90%
And they'll speak to us.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:84%
My dad's been dead
almost 30 years,

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.070 align:middle line:90%
and I cannot summon my father.

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:90%
He's Norwegian, I'm Norwegian.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.950 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.710 align:middle line:84%
He's going to come
when he feels like it.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So for about 10 times
over these years,

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:84%
he's just shown up
and talked to me.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:84%
The most recent was maybe
a year and a half ago.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I was in a car, driving
to a baseball game.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:15.690 align:middle line:84%
He sat in the car next to
me, in the passenger seat.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The seat deflated, and he
just started talking to me.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:90%
I could hear him--

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:84%
not like you would hear a
normal human, but in my head.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.650 align:middle line:90%
But it was his voice.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So he just shows up and
guides every once in a while.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.950 align:middle line:90%
So they can help.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:90%
They can guide.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.290 align:middle line:90%
They can visit.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and they can also--

00:29:32.748 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I had a unique experience
after my mother died.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:84%
My sister and her eldest
daughter, in particular--

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.590 align:middle line:84%
they just were still picking
up the phone to call mom,

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and talking about her
a lot, and so forth.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, one night in a
dream, she came through.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And she came through
raggedy and exhausted,

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:84%
like she was coming
from another dimension.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And she came in and said,
do you know how exhausting

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:84%
it is for me to come
from where I am now,

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:84%
to try to come through to answer
or communicate with all of you?

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:90%
And I said, mom, don't do it.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Go back where you are
living now and stay there.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't need you
to do anything.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.958 align:middle line:84%
Mostly it's just
nostalgic and familial.

00:30:16.958 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
We can do that in our own
way, in our own hearts.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:90%
This is not to summon you.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:84%
My sister had a
dream the same night.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.710 align:middle line:90%
So she came to my sister, too.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:90%
And so that was it.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: That's gorgeous.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that respectful?

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.407 align:middle line:84%
My mom just died a few months
ago, and I had the funeral.

00:30:31.407 --> 00:30:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sorry.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Thank you.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's visited.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And about three weeks
ago, I had the funeral.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And the day before, the funeral
director called me and said,

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.390 align:middle line:84%
now we're going to
seal up the urn.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.300 align:middle line:84%
If you want any ashes, you
have to let me know now.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And I did not want
bags of ashes.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to do this.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm really busy, I
don't want to do it.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.670 align:middle line:90%
My mother's voice was so loud.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.660 align:middle line:84%
She was like, you'd better tell
him we want two bags of ashes,

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.310 align:middle line:84%
because one has
to go to the ocean

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and one has to go
to the Badlands.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so funny.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.075 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: She hasn't
been gone that long,

00:31:10.075 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:84%
so she's still sort of
interactive, directing

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.200 align:middle line:84%
everything, which would
be what she would have

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.467 align:middle line:90%
done when she was alive, too.

00:31:16.467 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK then, let's talk
about interdimensional beings,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:84%
because this is a wide
array of entities.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, yes.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.590 align:middle line:84%
We can't even name them
all, because there's

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:84%
at least 13 known dimensions--
some scientists say 26.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.887 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So many different
species within all dimensions.

00:31:35.887 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Oh, and different
planets, constellations.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:41.223 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you start to
really bear down on those,

00:31:41.223 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:84%
you're going to say, well,
there's deceased souls from all

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.350 align:middle line:90%
those dimensions, right?

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's living, or animate,
souls from those dimensions.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can access
them from the past.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you were alive on a
blue planet 1,000 years ago--

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.780 align:middle line:84%
you can connect into that
planet, what it is now,

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and what it was then.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's
concurrent realities.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:90%
And there is future realities.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
whole notion of parallel

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.475 align:middle line:84%
realities-- you could
throw that into the mix.

00:32:06.475 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Oh, there's
all kinds of beings.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It's why I like studying with
shamans in different places

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.910 align:middle line:84%
in the world, because
that doesn't throw them.

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They'll just go, oh,
here's a star being,

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
or here's a Pleiadian, or
here's somebody from the future,

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.050 align:middle line:90%
or here's an alien.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:90%
They're not scared.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.950 align:middle line:90%
They're not scared.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:24.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But a
lot of people who

00:32:24.325 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:84%
don't have the vocabulary for
it and the knowledge around it

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:90%
are scared.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about interdimensional beings

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and some of the ways
in which they show up--

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.650 align:middle line:90%
non-physicals.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They're non-physicals.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, again, they can just talk.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:90%
They can speak.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.190 align:middle line:84%
You might see them as just
wavy energies, or colors,

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:90%
or shimmering.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.450 align:middle line:84%
They may project that
image into you, as well.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:90%
They might touch you.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And you just feel, this is
not a touch I understand.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:84%
This is from something
or somewhere else than

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.660 align:middle line:90%
what I know, as well.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, they do their
best to communicate with us.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask questions--
that's the key.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Ask questions.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Where are you from?

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Are you from the light?

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Whatever word you use for
spirit, god, goodness.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Are you here for
a loving intent?

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.450 align:middle line:84%
If you're not, my guidance
needs to take you away.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.875 align:middle line:84%
So interacting gives you the
answers and the reassurance

00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:21.675 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:33:21.675 --> 00:33:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
respectful to ask questions.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, it is respectful.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're showing
up, they want to communicate.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.710 align:middle line:84%
They want you to know
that they're there.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I worked maybe a year ago with
this little boy, 12-year-old.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Came in, wouldn't tell
me what was going on.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.920 align:middle line:90%
His mother was sitting there.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.120 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, just tell
me what you get for him.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at him.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.150 align:middle line:90%
He looks like-- he's adorable.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:47.233 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you speak
to aliens, don't you?

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, how
do you know that?

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I go, because there's
one around you.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I could see her
in my mind's eye.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, yeah, there's
this little girl who's blue

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.020 align:middle line:90%
who shows up and talks to me.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:33:59.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how
reassuring for him.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And his mother, now--
it's reassuring for her,

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.775 align:middle line:84%
because now her little
son's not crazy.

00:34:05.775 --> 00:34:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: He's not crazy.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
seeing what he's up to.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:08.607 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: He's not
psychotic, right.

00:34:08.607 --> 00:34:10.460 align:middle line:84%
There's an alien
who talks to him.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And I just said,
oh, you're an X-Men.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.389 align:middle line:90%
I just said, you're an X-Men.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.469 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I'm an
X-Men, that's so cool.

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:17.719 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's so sweet.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:18.802 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Isn't it adorable?

00:34:18.802 --> 00:34:19.602 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:19.602 --> 00:34:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, so I
think a lot of people

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.000 align:middle line:84%
get these experiences,
but they don't

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.980 align:middle line:84%
talk about them because they
don't want to be labeled.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.690 align:middle line:84%
The family members might
think they're weird,

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.460 align:middle line:90%
or they're talking to demons.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Which, again, is why
it's OK to ask questions.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.733 align:middle line:90%
Are you from goodness, or not?

00:34:35.733 --> 00:34:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Are you interference,
which is not good.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if they're
not from goodness,

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.120 align:middle line:84%
are they going to
tell you the truth?

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You can feel it.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:84%
You can smell it,
you can feel it.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:43.425 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll disappear.

00:34:43.425 --> 00:34:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and let's talk
about smell, too, in a moment.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.377 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Smell's big.

00:34:46.377 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is big.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's big.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Big clue.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]
OK, we also have--

00:34:50.903 --> 00:34:52.320 align:middle line:84%
we'll get through
this other part,

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:84%
and then let's go back
to touch and smell.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:55.269 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Good.

00:34:55.269 --> 00:34:56.602 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so we have aliens.

00:34:56.602 --> 00:34:57.402 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:34:57.402 --> 00:34:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Third-dimensional
and other-wordly aliens.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what's the
distinction there often,

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:84%
in your own mind, in terms of
maybe the type of communication

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot?

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: To me, aliens that
present themselves to me

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:15.530 align:middle line:84%
or the people who I know
do tend to be more 3D.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.410 align:middle line:84%
They're from another
planet or constellation,

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're more in
the here and now.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.650 align:middle line:90%
So they're current.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.450 align:middle line:84%
They may be beaming in on
super conductive light,

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.270 align:middle line:84%
or traveling around in
super cool spaceships,

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:33.020 align:middle line:84%
or holographically
projecting themselves,

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.260 align:middle line:90%
but they're like you or me.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.020 align:middle line:84%
It would be like
talking to somebody

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:84%
through the airways from China,
but they're just from someplace

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
To me, interdimensional
are really

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.720 align:middle line:84%
not describable by human
terms, because they're mainly

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:90%
energy beings.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:52.310 align:middle line:84%
They're made more
of sound and light.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a guide
one time say to me,

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.080 align:middle line:84%
you know, humans are
just made out of sound,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:90%
light, soul, and mud?

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Like-- mud, right?

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.330 align:middle line:90%
The old good Adam and Eve clay.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Back to basics, yep--

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:90%
minerals, right.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And aliens, in
their realm, are sort of 3D.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So they're made out of
some type of material.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Even if they know
how to evaporate it,

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.370 align:middle line:84%
or "Star Trek" it, or "Star
Wars" it, or whatever it is,

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.388 align:middle line:84%
they're just more like us than
interdimensionals might be.

00:36:23.388 --> 00:36:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so then they
have another question.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at
communications-- and you

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:28.893 align:middle line:90%
may not be able to answer this.

00:36:28.893 --> 00:36:30.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at
communications with

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:84%
interdimensionals--
which are non-physical,

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.825 align:middle line:84%
so they're going to have a
totally different relationship

00:36:34.825 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:90%
to time and space--

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:40.500 align:middle line:84%
versus third-dimensional
alien types who would have,

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.810 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, a similar
relationship to space

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:43.610 align:middle line:90%
and time--

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Totally.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --when you're
talking with them,

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.600 align:middle line:84%
can you get more
accurate information--

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.780 align:middle line:84%
say in terms of pegging
something into a time frame--

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.850 align:middle line:84%
from an alien versus
an interdimension?

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yes, I get more
practical data, usable data,

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:59.388 align:middle line:84%
from the aliens, because there's
an understanding of matter.

00:36:59.388 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, time and space.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Not just energy--
it's time and space, exactly.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.420 align:middle line:84%
When I've worked with
interdimensionals,

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.320 align:middle line:84%
typically I find they're trying
to instruct me or teach me.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And they really have
to dumb it down.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they don't
really live in a sense of time

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:14.610 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: No, they give me
more senses of things.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They were trying
to even teach me

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.990 align:middle line:84%
what plants could
do on this planet,

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and they had to kind of
send me ripples of energy.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I had to go to sleep in
order to understand it.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Some other part of me-- some
deeper, smarter, part of me--

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.090 align:middle line:84%
had to work with
the data to come up

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.060 align:middle line:84%
with explainable
information about it,

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:84%
because they're
really beyond us.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.120 align:middle line:90%
They're beyond.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.490 align:middle line:84%
They're in front of and
after us, you could even say.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's why I thought

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:47.115 align:middle line:84%
that might be a distinguishing
factor between that.

00:37:47.115 --> 00:37:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Perfect,
excellent, excellent.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let's talk
about when we're actually

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.380 align:middle line:90%
just communicating-- not just.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:84%
We're communicating with our
own higher mind, our own higher

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:01.500 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, which is every
bit as expansive and beautiful--

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --as most any other
entity we're reaching out to.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.897 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, we communicate
with parts of ourselves

00:38:06.897 --> 00:38:07.700 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Family system therapists
are having you talk

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:90%
to your inner child constantly.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what therapy is
about-- different aspects.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So then, we can also talk to
different parts of our soul

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.120 align:middle line:84%
that have been around and
alive in different time periods

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.620 align:middle line:90%
and learn from them.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, ultimately, it's about
talking to our higher self--

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, always.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Higher mind, higher
self, higher spirit--

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that's sort of all-knowing,
already interconnected,

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
all wise, very humored,
I think, sometimes

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:41.720 align:middle line:84%
in a kind way by what
we're not getting yet.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's a kind humor.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you'll
get it, it's OK.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I help my younger
son sometimes with baseball.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.395 align:middle line:90%
Frequently, I have him--

00:38:50.395 --> 00:38:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't use the
word higher self,

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I use the word
future self, for him.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, how does your
future self throw the ball?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.085 align:middle line:90%
He'll go, OK, let me check.

00:38:58.085 --> 00:38:58.885 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:58.885 --> 00:39:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's great, yeah.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's really practical.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And then, he can feel it.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.278 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as an X-Man, he
can relate to his future self.

00:39:06.278 --> 00:39:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly, exactly.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And he can feel it in the body,
because our higher self can

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:15.110 align:middle line:84%
be in our so-called lower
self, our physical self,

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and run vibrationally
so we can get what

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:90%
it's trying to communicate.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Whereas somebody
else's higher self

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:25.220 align:middle line:84%
may not relate to us
quite the same way.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's a perfect way
to source information,

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:29.835 align:middle line:84%
or wisdom, or even
something practical like,

00:39:29.835 --> 00:39:31.210 align:middle line:84%
should I go to
the movies or not?

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:34.482 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I mean, this
isn't all highfalutin.

00:39:34.482 --> 00:39:37.010 align:middle line:90%


00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, where
I'm stymied the most

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.040 align:middle line:90%
aren't on big decisions.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.650 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like, I don't
know what to eat for dinner.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.690 align:middle line:90%
I have no sense of it.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So it might take me
15 minutes to get

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.860 align:middle line:84%
my higher self, or my body
self, or my inner child,

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to sort through all of this
just to make a decision.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.187 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes,
we're just stymied.

00:39:57.187 --> 00:39:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm the same with you.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.230 align:middle line:90%
I can make big decisions fast.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:03.325 align:middle line:84%
Little ones like, as you
say, what to eat, totally--

00:40:03.325 --> 00:40:04.700 align:middle line:84%
when other people
start ordering,

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:90%
it's, oh, that sounds good.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.290 align:middle line:90%
I think I want that.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:07.675 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:07.675 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, I know.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're also probably
relating empathically to them.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god,
that has to be it, too.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And it just totally
throws me off.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.076 align:middle line:84%
I should just order first when
I have a sense of something--

00:40:17.076 --> 00:40:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, let's
talk about smell and touch--

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that notion when you can feel
some being touching your hair,

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.290 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:27.805 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:40:27.805 --> 00:40:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, in one way, it belongs
to the basket of clairempathy.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Touch, smell-- all those
senses is really valid.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can feel
certain beings or guides--

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.430 align:middle line:84%
when they're giving
me information,

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.370 align:middle line:84%
or waking me up in the
morning, or whatever it is--

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:90%
touching me.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And why wouldn't we
be able to do that?

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Because we're in body,
and that's just as much

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of an empathic sense
as anything else.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And I make a lot of decisions
by smell, even with clients.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:03.050 align:middle line:84%
A client will say, well,
what about my Uncle Henry,

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.850 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And if I smell a
bad smell, I'll go,

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, either there's
something bad that

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.070 align:middle line:84%
happened between
you and Uncle Henry,

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.770 align:middle line:84%
or Uncle Henry's stuck
and needs some help.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Or we're not
smelling uncle Henry,

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.360 align:middle line:84%
we're smelling something sort
of bad that's hanging around you

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.930 align:middle line:90%
that we'd better figure out.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:26.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't hide the intention
of something or somebody

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:27.980 align:middle line:90%
from smell.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the oldest sense, and it's
always going to be accurate.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I remember actually
even-- years ago,

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:36.410 align:middle line:84%
when I met a man who I dated
for a year, year and a half.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.450 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I met
him, I smelled roses.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't wearing eau de
rose, or whatever it would be.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, I just smell
roses around you.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And he started crying,
because he had lost a sister--

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Megan was her name--

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.670 align:middle line:90%
who always wore rose oil.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, oh,
my sister's around,

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:59.030 align:middle line:84%
which just bonded us
right away, because there

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.850 align:middle line:84%
was this instant sense
of trusting each other

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.318 align:middle line:84%
and how we know
information about that.

00:42:04.318 --> 00:42:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and sometimes
when a person will come in just

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.630 align:middle line:84%
with their own
energy, they may not

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:12.080 align:middle line:84%
be wearing any kind essential
oil or perfume or anything,

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.600 align:middle line:90%
but there's this lovely scent.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: There's a smell.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there's a smell.

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, my son and I used
to talk about the garbage man,

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.485 align:middle line:84%
because in this
one little area--

00:42:21.485 --> 00:42:24.350 align:middle line:84%
it was like a tube in the
middle of the living room,

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:84%
this one little
three-foot radius--

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.710 align:middle line:84%
you'd walk through it, and you
could smell the garbage man.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:31.877 align:middle line:90%
It was like burning garbage.

00:42:31.877 --> 00:42:33.043 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: [LAUGHING] I get it.

00:42:33.043 --> 00:42:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like, what
are you doing here?

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And he and I could always smell
it, but other people couldn't.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I told a friend of mine who
was actually very open--

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.540 align:middle line:84%
very empathetic and
intuitive, also--

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I was saying, yeah,
this garbage man's

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.868 align:middle line:84%
hanging out in this tube
in the middle of the house.

00:42:46.868 --> 00:42:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And we just got used to stuff
like this, seeing things.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
have one too, right

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:52.662 align:middle line:90%
outside my bedroom window.

00:42:52.662 --> 00:42:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: [LAUGHING]
That's so funny.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.355 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's just kind
of stinking the place up.

00:42:56.355 --> 00:42:56.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.163 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, they got issues
they have to work through,

00:42:59.163 --> 00:43:00.560 align:middle line:90%
whoever the invisible being is.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's talk about it.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Is there any way
to encourage people

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.180 align:middle line:90%
like the garbageman to move on?

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, yeah.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because I didn't.

00:43:06.485 --> 00:43:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I just let squirrels stay,
garbage men, whoever's there,

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.760 align:middle line:90%
stay.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I have another
super easy technique I use.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I just call it streams of light,
or healing streams of grace.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It just recognizes that
it's always available,

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.180 align:middle line:84%
our streams of grace-- which,
to me, isn't a religious term.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.070 align:middle line:90%
It's love in motion.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be invented
as they're needed.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.700 align:middle line:90%
They're just always there.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.780 align:middle line:84%
All great healers, I believe,
have used something like this.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:33.830 align:middle line:90%
And I just ask.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.510 align:middle line:90%
I call for streams of grace.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:38.310 align:middle line:84%
I just say, please send streams
of grace-- not through me,

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.110 align:middle line:90%
but directly--

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, directly, OK.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: --to the garbage
man, or the hurt person,

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.780 align:middle line:84%
or the person
having the meltdown.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:84%
You can even be in
Target and just get

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that funny, weird feeling
about what somebody is doing,

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.150 align:middle line:84%
or how they're
treating their kids,

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.820 align:middle line:90%
or they give off that bad smell.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't get
involved, and you don't

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:58.940 align:middle line:90%
want to take on the energy.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So I just ask for
streams of grace

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.285 align:middle line:90%
to go to them or the situation.

00:44:02.285 --> 00:44:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
thank you for that.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It works.

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, instead
of just being tolerant.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.487 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People come
for a couple days,

00:44:10.487 --> 00:44:11.570 align:middle line:90%
and they stay for a month.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no boundaries,
including with the garbage.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:14.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, you can surround
yourself with streams of grace,

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.680 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Talk about empathic boundaries.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Or even if you get too many
pictures, or too many voices,

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:23.510 align:middle line:90%
bring these streams around you.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And just say, I can seal
myself off with this energy.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It's good energy, so
I'm not harming anybody,

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.950 align:middle line:84%
but I don't need to
be harmed, either.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, right, and
I don't need to smell that.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about when

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.520 align:middle line:84%
you're being approached
or influenced

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.260 align:middle line:90%
by darker realm beings.

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, it's common.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons people
sometimes don't like to talk

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:47.120 align:middle line:84%
about this is
because, certainly,

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:84%
some types of darker beings--
whether they're fallen angels,

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:53.570 align:middle line:84%
or dead people, or spirits
that have never incarnated,

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.170 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it might be--

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:58.370 align:middle line:84%
they tend to go after one of
two basic types of people,

00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:59.990 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to steal energy.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Their goal is to steal energy.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.280 align:middle line:84%
They either want to steal
somebody's life energy,

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.780 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to be dense enough

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.760 align:middle line:90%
to remain on the earth plane.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Or they want to steal
somebody's light,

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.320 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
want to go to the light

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.530 align:middle line:90%
to get fed spiritually.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So what they tend to do
is either try to really

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.830 align:middle line:90%
haunt or scare people--

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:24.710 align:middle line:84%
to scare them, or to
kind of stir their shame,

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:26.970 align:middle line:90%
so they act out on addictions.

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.845 align:middle line:84%
Because when people
are scared, or when

00:45:28.845 --> 00:45:31.220 align:middle line:84%
they're acting in a way that
they feel embarrassed about,

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.380 align:middle line:84%
or when they're
yelling or screaming

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:38.090 align:middle line:84%
or something, or angry or
something in an unhealthy way,

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.730 align:middle line:84%
then it's very easy for
some of these beings

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:41.972 align:middle line:90%
to steal their life energy.

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there's a
lot of wattage behind that.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's a lot of power,
and they can just plumb take it,

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:47.900 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:52.910 align:middle line:84%
The other frequent accommodation
that they make, however--

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:55.820 align:middle line:84%
or companions that they
seek-- are really nice people

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:58.073 align:middle line:90%
who are very sweet and kind.

00:45:58.073 --> 00:45:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And you talk about wattage--

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.400 align:middle line:84%
they're like light
bulbs for a spirit.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Like angels on earth,
and they're so sweet.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they tend to
get victimized by dark beings

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:11.240 align:middle line:84%
or creatures too, because they
have so much beautiful energy

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:16.010 align:middle line:84%
of goodness and light that
they're perfect feeder systems

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.200 align:middle line:90%
for another to steal the light.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And they tend not to
understand that they

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:22.250 align:middle line:90%
need to be more powerful.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.480 align:middle line:90%
They can say, no.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.280 align:middle line:90%
They can say, go get your own.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Or, if you're dead,
go to the other side.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes
really nice people

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:34.820 align:middle line:84%
don't like to admit or say that
maybe something's drinking off

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:38.090 align:middle line:84%
of them or maybe they feel
something shadowy around,

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.310 align:middle line:84%
because they think
it means they're bad,

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:42.880 align:middle line:84%
instead of it might mean that
they're just really good.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But they need to get
some more street smarts

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.550 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to spirituality.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
also, when you're

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.840 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
quality of messages,

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.200 align:middle line:84%
you got a nice, clear channel
going there between you

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.400 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But you're getting
messages that are

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:00.950 align:middle line:84%
strong and clear and
powerful, but maybe

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.620 align:middle line:84%
not in the highest and best
good for you or someone else.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Exactly,
and then we have

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:08.450 align:middle line:84%
to keep asking questions
and re-evaluating.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I had a client--

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.470 align:middle line:84%
lovely person, lovely
woman, a nurse.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.930 align:middle line:84%
She kept getting messages
that these different men

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:16.645 align:middle line:84%
she was meeting were
going to marry her.

00:47:16.645 --> 00:47:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well, have
any of them married you?

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:19.130 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Have you dated any of them?

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.160 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.057 align:middle line:84%
But she said, but my
guides keep telling me

00:47:23.057 --> 00:47:24.140 align:middle line:90%
that they're meant for me.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:24.500 align:middle line:90%
And I go--

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then, you
think you're delusional.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, you need
a higher set of guides,

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.350 align:middle line:84%
because they're talking
about possibilities.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:36.372 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to get
guidance-- first of all,

00:47:36.372 --> 00:47:38.330 align:middle line:84%
we're not supposed to
get that much information

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:40.400 align:middle line:84%
about the future because, heck,
we're supposed to live it.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree,
we have to choose.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We have to choose.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.220 align:middle line:90%
We're alive.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.560 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to
feel it, be it.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.180 align:middle line:84%
You know what I
mean-- experience it.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to get very
much, unless it's a warning,

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.620 align:middle line:84%
or it's to tell you when
you're in the right place,

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.680 align:middle line:84%
or if it's to make
you work hard.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's just to
freaking make you work hard.

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, stay on task.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: This is what
you're supposed to do,

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:90%
so you have to keep on task.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So anything that's
sort of sugar coating

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:05.360 align:middle line:84%
how easy this is
going to be tends

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.340 align:middle line:90%
to be sort of lower order.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can fire a set of guides
and ask for a higher set,

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.870 align:middle line:84%
too, that are more
respectful of spiritual law.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because that
actually is really, really

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.150 align:middle line:84%
common with people
who have just started

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.340 align:middle line:84%
trying to work with their
intuitive capacities.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting all
this lovely information

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:28.940 align:middle line:84%
that they love hearing,
but it doesn't turn out.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result, then
they start losing their faith

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:32.840 align:middle line:90%
in themselves.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Exactly, and it
happens to all of us.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we go
through a big change,

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.300 align:middle line:84%
we tend to kind of get a
little bit more mixed up, too.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we get different
messages coming in,

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.850 align:middle line:90%
or different beings.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So after a big
change, I tell people,

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.450 align:middle line:84%
just don't believe too much of
what you're hearing right away.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Just let it sort of modulate.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Go to the top, whatever
you call the top.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Go top down.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.890 align:middle line:84%
That's my phrase--
is, go top down.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Just go-- whatever you
call spirit, god, oneness,

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:08.860 align:middle line:84%
creator, go there and ask for
the guidance to come top down.

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.012 align:middle line:90%
And it sorts it through.

00:49:10.012 --> 00:49:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
don't invest too much

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.480 align:middle line:90%
in any future messages.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No, no.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I totally
agree with you on that.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.810 align:middle line:84%
My guides never
tell me what to do.

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you
make your choices,

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and we'll give you
all the help you need.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:22.180 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: But here you are.

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --these
are your choices.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do?

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Because of
what I do for a living,

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:27.878 align:middle line:84%
people are constantly
asking, where

00:49:27.878 --> 00:49:29.670 align:middle line:84%
do you think you're
going to end up living?

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.710 align:middle line:90%
I go, I have no idea.

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my house, right now.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:36.380 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I'm in a
nice place, right now.

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I'll
guess I'll wait and see.

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the big question
people ask intuitives--

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:44.600 align:middle line:90%
I hear this over and over--

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.750 align:middle line:84%
what am I supposed to
be doing with my life?

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:52.130 align:middle line:90%
You have to decide that.

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.867 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your journey to--

00:49:54.867 --> 00:49:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's your journey.

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --really begin
feeling into that--

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:58.115 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly, right.

00:49:58.115 --> 00:50:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and making
those decisions.

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: What I like to
do with those questions--

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I do have a gift of
seeing colors that

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.380 align:middle line:90%
describe somebody's giftings.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:90%
So then I just--

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.750 align:middle line:90%
it's super simple for me.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.417 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, give
an example of this,

00:50:10.417 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:90%
how you might answer that.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to be doing.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here on earth?

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, OK, so
I'm going super simple,

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:19.600 align:middle line:84%
but you obviously have
a ton of white energy.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.740 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.420 align:middle line:90%
It comes off of you.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a spiritual energy.

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So I would be able to
tell you or somebody who's

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:29.410 align:middle line:84%
like you, well,
ultimately, you're

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:32.170 align:middle line:84%
going to be coaching and guiding
people about spirituality

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:33.480 align:middle line:90%
and what it really means.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
a way that I would

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:37.098 align:middle line:90%
start answering the question.

00:50:37.098 --> 00:50:39.557 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But can't that be
seen as a dictate of some kind?

00:50:39.557 --> 00:50:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm supposed to be
a spiritual counselor,

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.430 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: There's usually
more than one color, too.

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, good, so
let's talk about it.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:47.435 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So then people have
to put it all together,

00:50:47.435 --> 00:50:48.910 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] which is
where the rub is.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:52.780 align:middle line:84%
How do you put it together
in a way that's unique?

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.670 align:middle line:90%
And part of that uniqueness--

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:56.200 align:middle line:90%
people don't always like this.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.580 align:middle line:90%
I just find this.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I can't prove this,
it's my opinion.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.980 align:middle line:84%
But I think part of
how we put it together

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.710 align:middle line:84%
is we have to take what we've
gone through that's been hell,

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.775 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean god
sat there and said,

00:51:08.775 --> 00:51:10.400 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go
through this, or you

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.830 align:middle line:84%
have to have an
addiction, or you

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:14.440 align:middle line:84%
have to have a horrible
parents, or whatever.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere, we have
to transmit that energy.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to fit into
what we do at some point.

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So you see someone, and
they're exuding white energy.

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But there is also a subset
of energy of other colors,

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.850 align:middle line:90%
other challenges, coming in.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, maybe
communication, maybe vision.

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's read that.

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And what would that look like
when you're talking to someone?

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: All right, so then
typically what will come up

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.610 align:middle line:84%
in my sessions-- because I
orient more as a healer--

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:42.520 align:middle line:84%
let's bring things to the
light, and let's transform it.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what we can do.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll see that they
were an addict, an alcoholic.

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And they may be sober,
they may not be.

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'll get a strong
sense that line

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.760 align:middle line:84%
within the addiction
and the recovery

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.220 align:middle line:90%
is a direction for them to go.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And they may even
be the one to say,

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:06.490 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm like a therapist.

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I have this spiritual
energy, I'm really physical.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about being a
coach for former addicts.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well, you
already had your answer.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.230 align:middle line:84%
There you go, you're
putting it all together.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Because you can help people
that you can understand.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And they
know you get it, too.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now, the other
thing about being an addict--

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:28.360 align:middle line:84%
alcohol, drugs,
whatnot-- is that there

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.100 align:middle line:84%
is more of a
porosity that you can

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:34.210 align:middle line:84%
be a little more easy to work
with from the other side--

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:35.390 align:middle line:90%
good, bad, and indifferent.

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Totally.

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Much more permeable.

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Porous,
holes in the aura.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
take alcoholism,

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.520 align:middle line:84%
where there have been some
very famous psychics who

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.820 align:middle line:90%
are alcoholics.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.897 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people say,
well, how can that count?

00:52:49.897 --> 00:52:50.980 align:middle line:90%
And how can that be valid?

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.687 align:middle line:84%
Well, because they're
wide open, right?

00:52:52.687 --> 00:52:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They're wide open.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So certain types of
alcohol addiction

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.630 align:middle line:84%
relate to different
energy centers.

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Really hard core alcohol
addiction is very first chakra.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.350 align:middle line:84%
That's physical,
that's in the hip area.

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:08.800 align:middle line:84%
That person will be really
open to physical energy,

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe to talking to dead
people, and knowing what they

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:13.960 align:middle line:90%
were like when they were alive.

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I think of
Arthur Ford and Ruth Montgomery

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:17.770 align:middle line:90%
and their relationship, right?

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Arthur tipped the
bottle very open, right?

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah, Yeah.

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:27.700 align:middle line:10%
So addictions are
often also a symptom

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:33.760 align:middle line:10%
of a very powerful chakra that
hasn't been put to highest use

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.320 align:middle line:10%
yet, as well.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times
women, especially,

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.610 align:middle line:84%
will drink wine a
lot-- that's heart.

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're very
heart-based people.

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So if they're not
getting those needs met,

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:46.930 align:middle line:84%
the alcohol, the wine,
may help them feel it.

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And whether they quit drinking,
or they just modify it,

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.610 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it might be,
that's probably a healer

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:54.890 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.250 align:middle line:84%
That's somebody who can
sense what other people are

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:59.500 align:middle line:84%
relationally going
through, or what they might

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.480 align:middle line:90%
need as a healing capacity.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So these addictions line up
with our stronger chakras,

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's different
gifts in different chakras.

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So I never shame somebody
for an addiction.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, how can we work this?

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:16.480 align:middle line:84%
How can we come to
a healthier place

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.580 align:middle line:84%
with a behavior or
a substance where

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:24.910 align:middle line:84%
you can own a power or a
strength in the middle of this?

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's go
into some exotic stuff,

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.810 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
lot in this book.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And I really like the
way you do your research.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I like the way you clarify,
you validate, explain.

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:37.870 align:middle line:84%
These are handbooks
for people who

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:41.330 align:middle line:84%
really want to work with
whatever their clairs are.

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They're primers.

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're primers.

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They're
really study books.

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:44.020 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They really
are study books.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.490 align:middle line:84%
You do a beautiful job
articulating and laying things

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:48.290 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, you get into what
people consider to be weird.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
phenomena of speaking

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:54.910 align:middle line:90%
in tongues.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yes, I had a great
time researching that.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I am not a speaking-in-tonguer,
just to be honest.

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.850 align:middle line:90%
I have friends who are.

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I think some gifts--
you naturally have some,

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:07.960 align:middle line:90%
you can develop some.

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.370 align:middle line:90%
They're just not your way.

00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not my way of
being clairaudient,

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:12.880 align:middle line:90%
but I've been around it.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Speaking in
tongues-- it's a gift

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that's been known
thousands of years,

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:19.650 align:middle line:90%
and not only in Christianity.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.820 align:middle line:84%
We know about it because of
the drop of the Holy Spirit

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.720 align:middle line:90%
during Pentecost.

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And everybody, when
Jesus was alive,

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.650 align:middle line:84%
then started to
speak in tongues.

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of debate
in the "New Testament"

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.900 align:middle line:84%
about, well, what's
the value if you

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.150 align:middle line:90%
don't know what you're saying?

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's more valuable if
you know what you're saying.

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's this, and
that, and the other thing.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But in my research, it's
been in almost every culture

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.890 align:middle line:84%
around the world, because
it's about bringing

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:47.430 align:middle line:84%
through languaging,
bringing through information

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:50.940 align:middle line:84%
that might be from a divine
source, like angelic.

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.130 align:middle line:90%
It could come from aliens.

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And some people actually have
the speaking-in-tongue gift

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.800 align:middle line:84%
of bringing through
another Earth language

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.630 align:middle line:90%
that they've never learned.

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, that happens when
they get hit in the head,

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.378 align:middle line:84%
and then something opens up
in what would be called--

00:56:06.378 --> 00:56:08.003 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Into maybe
a past life, even.

00:56:08.003 --> 00:56:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: A past life, or
an epigenetic material,

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:13.170 align:middle line:84%
an ancestor's language, and
they can bring it through.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:14.900 align:middle line:90%
So there's two basic types.

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.400 align:middle line:84%
There's sort of the divine
language that comes through.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.250 align:middle line:84%
But in there, I would put
through alien languages

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and interdimensional
languages, as well--

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:27.040 align:middle line:84%
or actually foreign languages,
Earth languages, too.

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So does it just
take a type of clairsentience

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:33.392 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
these things mean?

00:56:33.392 --> 00:56:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yes, yes, I think it
does take that clairsentience,

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:39.210 align:middle line:84%
or claircognizance,
or some way of being

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:43.140 align:middle line:84%
able to get the feeling of
what the vibrations mean

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.330 align:middle line:90%
to put it into words.

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:49.620 align:middle line:10%
I have a client who is a
complete speak-in-tongue.

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:51.330 align:middle line:90%
That's how she makes her living.

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:52.650 align:middle line:90%
And people change.

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:56.310 align:middle line:84%
She brings through different
beings from different planets.

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And her clients will
cry, they'll heal.

00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:01.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what she's saying,

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.750 align:middle line:90%
but they feel what she's saying.

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
amazing spiritually

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:10.260 align:middle line:84%
awakening experiences,
or they heal of diseases.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.872 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes she
understands who they are

00:57:12.872 --> 00:57:13.830 align:middle line:90%
and where they're from.

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes she doesn't, and
she's just a channel for it.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I can
see the beauty in that,

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:23.020 align:middle line:84%
in that you can be resistant
as the client to words you

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:23.820 align:middle line:90%
understand--

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because
you have filters.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whereas, if
it's coming in in a way

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:29.358 align:middle line:84%
where you can't even conceive
of what they're saying,

00:57:29.358 --> 00:57:32.130 align:middle line:84%
you're just getting the pure
information as just energy.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And energy is just
information that vibrates,

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:37.110 align:middle line:90%
so it's just vibration.

00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It's information that
bypasses your head.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.950 align:middle line:84%
God knows we need to do that
more often, like you're saying.

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's vibrating the
information into you

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.930 align:middle line:84%
in a way that can
literally change

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:51.190 align:middle line:90%
emotions and physicality.

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And years ago, I used
to do hypnotherapy.

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And I had just a
few clients I worked

00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.860 align:middle line:90%
with totally silent sessions.

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.110 align:middle line:84%
They would go into
agreement that there

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:02.640 align:middle line:90%
was a trust between us.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd work just with video
motor response, and no words

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.440 align:middle line:84%
at all, and especially
on performance,

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.160 align:middle line:84%
where you have issues
around sports performance,

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.075 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:58:12.075 --> 00:58:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were amazingly
powerful sessions,

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.200 align:middle line:90%
because we bypassed all filters.

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Beautiful.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
similar, the tongues.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's beautiful.

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:21.630 align:middle line:90%
It's the same idea, yeah.

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:22.963 align:middle line:90%
You're just getting out of here.

00:58:22.963 --> 00:58:24.838 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
book goes into all kinds

00:58:24.838 --> 00:58:25.770 align:middle line:90%
of beautiful things.

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, you go into the
devic realm and communicating

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:32.340 align:middle line:84%
with fairies, and water
sprites, and leprechauns,

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.742 align:middle line:84%
and kind of communication with
everything in every realm.

00:58:34.742 --> 00:58:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's quite fun.

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's really fun,
and very well laid out.

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So in our last minute
or so together,

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:43.740 align:middle line:84%
can you kind of
sum up what you'd

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:47.310 align:middle line:84%
like us to go away with--
the real meat of it, in terms

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:49.260 align:middle line:90%
of developing our clairaudience?

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I think just know that
you are clairaudient, which

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:53.670 align:middle line:90%
is just about clear hearing.

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:55.350 align:middle line:90%
And there's different styles.

00:58:55.350 --> 00:59:01.140 align:middle line:10%
You might be involved in hearing
voices, hearing your own voice,

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:05.400 align:middle line:10%
picking up from books,
or different verbal means

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.370 align:middle line:10%
in the environment--
speaking in tongues, writing.

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Just find your
way, and enjoy it,

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.872 align:middle line:84%
because it's an amazing
way to get guidance.

00:59:13.872 --> 00:59:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really is.

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And so it doesn't matter if you
turn the radio on, and a song,

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.172 align:middle line:84%
or the exact messaging,
or whether Siri

00:59:20.172 --> 00:59:21.630 align:middle line:84%
interrupts your
conversation-- even

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:23.120 align:middle line:90%
though that's kind of creepy.

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: [LAUGHS] I enjoy it.

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:27.023 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or whether you have
what seems to be tinnitus,

00:59:27.023 --> 00:59:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and you're listening to the
quality of tones up and down--

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.600 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.892 align:middle line:90%
It's all part of our interface.

00:59:31.892 --> 00:59:33.225 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's part of connecting.

00:59:33.225 --> 00:59:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is, indeed.

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Cyndi, thank you, again.

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.360 align:middle line:84%
It's so fun to sit
with you again.

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:36.820 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.028 align:middle line:84%
And your book is an absolutely
wonderful little guide

00:59:39.028 --> 00:59:42.700 align:middle line:84%
to opening these channels and
understanding them better.

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Thank you.
