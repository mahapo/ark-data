>>REGINA MEREDITH: You're
writing this new book with

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.632 align:middle line:90%
discoveries that are fresh--

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY SILVA: I know.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and new.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:14.975 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:15.810 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.762 align:middle line:84%
All those islands around
Scotland-- and there

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.470 align:middle line:84%
are things that there
shouldn't be there.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And archaeologists
actually agree with that.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we hunter-gatherers
interacted with these people,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:84%
it was always at times
of great tribulation.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, there
was always this hope.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.077 align:middle line:84%
--where one woman with seven
guys, and she is the head.

00:00:32.077 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One woman
equals seven guys,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I think is what you're saying.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.073 align:middle line:84%
And that happens all
around the world.

00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:84%
The energy lasts for
six to eight years

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:90%
after the real circle's gone.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:84%
The shape is just to
get your attention.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
400 years ago, we had bubonic
plague, which wiped off

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:90%
half of the human population.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:90%
And what did we get out of this?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:90%
The Renaissance.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:84%
We're told that once we've
given the information to people,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, "humans will
have to figure this out."

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's a large
window of opportunity.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:90%
But the window is closing.

>>REGINA: As we're re-emerging
from a global scenario that

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:10%
has left our world
changed, some of us

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:10%
are looking to simply get back
to normal, while others are

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:10%
ready to reinvent themselves.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:10%
Taken on a larger scale, what
is seldom spoken about here

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:10%
on Gaia and other sites
as how civilizations

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:10%
have re-emerged from
large-scale catastrophic events.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom always rises
in times of need.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And Freddy Silva and
I are going to focus

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
on some of the phenomenal
breakthroughs that

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
occurred in our Earth's history
following great challenge.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Freddy.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Good to see
you again, Regina.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
know, we're going

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.868 align:middle line:84%
to go a little further
than we had planned on

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:84%
in this conversation,
because there's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%
another part of this story
that we hadn't really

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
planned on talking
about that's woven in.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.428 align:middle line:90%
And we will get to that.

00:01:49.428 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's important to--

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I'm shocked
and surprised.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%
We always go off script.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
We should throw
it away, actually.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So I love what we have
going here about looking--

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
hopping around the world, and
looking at the various places,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:90%
and how--

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
what kind of incredible
breakthroughs

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
happen after we had
some kind of cataclysm.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing that
goes hand in hand with it,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and I bring it up
because we're doing

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff on
disclosure these days,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:90%
is that other beings--

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and I've mentioned you
in other interviews--

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
called the Shining Ones
often show up at that time

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and help humanity back to--

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:90%
well, they help us move forward.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.932 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They help
with the inventiveness.

00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:34.758 align:middle line:84%
So I would love you to just
comment on that and how

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:90%
the Shining Ones have appeared.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go
around these various places

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and look at what they and
humans have contributed.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Like traveling
around the world

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:90%
without paying for it.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I love this show.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had a little--
you said off camera, Orson

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Welles said what?

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The Swiss
had 900 years--

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
the Swiss had 900
years of peace,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:90%
and what did they give us?

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:90%
The cuckoo clock.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's what peace
does to a brain.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Let's see
what tension does.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:90%
No, it's absolutely right.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if you look
at the old traditions,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.480 align:middle line:10%
whether you're sitting in
South America, or the Middle

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:10%
East, or Mesopotamia,
or Egypt, these people

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:10%
had this nickname called
the Shining Ones, one,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.420 align:middle line:10%
because, incredibly enough,
they had very light skin.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.637 align:middle line:10%
So they kept putting this
sort of sealant on it

00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:10%
to protect themselves
against the sun.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So it gave them a
shiny appearance.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.450 align:middle line:84%
But it was also a
nickname that defined them

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:90%
as very intellectual people.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a high
level of intellect,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
obviously, you have a shine
about you, a glow about you.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So it was a
wonderful compliment.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I read about
the Indigenous stories,

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:84%
whenever we
hunter-gatherers back

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
in the day interacted
with these people,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:84%
it was always at times
of great tribulation.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So either the Earth had
been absolutely pummeled

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
by meteorites, or
sea levels had risen,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:90%
we'd lost lands to the oceans.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, there
was always this hope.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And these people always
show up at the right moment.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they say, well,
let's start agriculture.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with a cow that we
really can't do anything with.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And we'll make the
cow give us milk,

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:84%
or we'll do some other
animal husbandry, or, I know.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
We'll take some
grain, which is wild.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.245 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a way
to domesticate grain.

00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can make
lovely bread out of it

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.339 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
wonderful things.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:90%
And before you know it--

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.368 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Take the resources
that are there that we may not

00:04:19.368 --> 00:04:20.539 align:middle line:90%
have seen the value in--

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in our state
of trauma at the time.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And suddenly,
you have a way out.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
You have a positive
attitude to take.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And miraculously, around the
world, in little hot spots,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:84%
at exactly the same moment,
at around about 8500 BC,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:84%
a Tuesday, they basically--
we discovered civilization.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I bring
this up because we're

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:84%
being propagandized to
such a ridiculous extent

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to fear anything other that
might come here to this planet,

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
fearing other, and these
horrible Hollywood fright

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
scenarios, and even
the whole release

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
or non-release, non-disclosure
from the Pentagon

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:90%
in June of this year.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Even that suggests
that we need to know

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:90%
more-- they already know, OK?

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.063 align:middle line:84%
But we need to know more
because these beings seem to be

00:05:10.063 --> 00:05:11.230 align:middle line:90%
able to do more than we can.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And we better get prepared
so we can shoot them down

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:90%
They may be a threat.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And I am so sick and tired
of the threat scenario.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I've brought you
up in other interviews, saying,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:90%
look.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.030 align:middle line:84%
They've been here historically
all along, helping humanity.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
going on right now?

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're here now--

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --trying to help us.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Even aliens
lock their doors

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
when they fly past
the Earth nowadays.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
complaining about?

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's like, I'm not
going anywhere near that place.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're
totally not right.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So-- yeah, go ahead.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: But it's true.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I think that
people in governments,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
they do know what's
going on, undoubtedly so.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.518 align:middle line:84%
And I think they want to
have an edge of control

00:05:48.518 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:84%
over the situation so that
they can be the first people

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
to have contact.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
it comes down to.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:84%
They're just afraid that if
everybody else has the ability

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:84%
to make contact
with these people,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:84%
then it's no longer
their domain.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:90%
They can't control it.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:90%
I think it's that simple.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a proprietary
interest, and also technology.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very much so.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
according to the people

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:84%
that work in the
Pentagon and elsewhere,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
we've been dealing with them
forever and already exchanging

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.655 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:06:11.655 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's whoever
can own it first.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean, when we were
researching the crop circle

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon back in
the '80s and the '90s,

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
we had the same rapport
with the circle makers.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.105 align:middle line:90%
And I don't mean the people.

00:06:21.105 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
people who are actually

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:90%
making the real crop circles.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There are two
sides to this story.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.783 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And we had
our phones bugged.

00:06:28.783 --> 00:06:30.908 align:middle line:84%
And you know, back then,
you had your phone bugged,

00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:84%
because you had the real
phone, the landline.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because you were one

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
of the early people
that was outspoken

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:90%
on it, writing about it.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I used to throw the wrong
information down the phone

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.055 align:middle line:90%
to all my colleagues.

00:06:40.055 --> 00:06:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And they'd give me
nonsense on the phone.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
We'd already sent the right
information via snail mail.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.180 align:middle line:84%
People have to Google this
stuff now if you're under 30.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we'd get the
information crisscrossed to us.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And we were always at the
edge and the forefront

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:90%
of communication.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:84%
We knew where the crop
circles were going to be.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
We knew the information
we were going to be given

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and how to apply it.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
The government always
had to listen in to us

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
to find out what the
hell they'd been up to.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you'd send
them north instead of south.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, the
amount of times we

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.352 align:middle line:84%
sent the military
to the wrong field,

00:07:07.352 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're sitting on the side
of a hill, having a sandwich,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.573 align:middle line:84%
watching the British military
surrounding the wrong field.

00:07:12.573 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And we'd tell them,
you're in the wrong field.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:84%
It's-- we had a
lot of great fun.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't dangerous.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:84%
We didn't feel like there
was a sense of danger.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:84%
But again, it goes
back to what they

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:90%
were saying in the old days.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Hopi
said the same thing

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:90%
about these antediluvian people.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:90%
They were great helpers of--

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:84%
who assisted us
escape a sinking land

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the Pacific,
whose name I actually

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:90%
forget right now--

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.702 align:middle line:90%
Kásskara.

00:07:36.702 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I got to remember
all these names--

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.625 align:middle line:84%
and that they helped us
go from stepping stone

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:84%
to stepping stone,
because that's

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:90%
all that was left of our land.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.188 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Sea level is rising.

00:07:45.188 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's because of them--

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
one of them was
called Anu-Sinom,

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:84%
the leader of their
pack, who helped

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
a group called the
Hisat-Sinom, who

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
became known as the Anasazi,
before the Hopi reached

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:84%
the Southwest of America,
where they are now.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yeah, they
told us to not be complacent.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Every 16 years,
move somewhere else,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
look at the lay of the
land, and adapt to the land.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we survived
these great catastrophes.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:90%
And look at where we are.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.210 align:middle line:84%
We survived for, what, 8,000
years, before white people

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.408 align:middle line:84%
show up, and the whole
thing starts all over again.

00:08:17.408 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All over again.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So yeah.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So they've maintained
themselves in perfect balance

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:90%
with their environment.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
all came down to.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.450 align:middle line:84%
It was the understanding of
natural laws, understanding

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:84%
what's happening up in
the sky, because you've

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:84%
got to know Earth's place in
the bigger system of things,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:90%
because this happens regularly.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole thing of
catastrophes from the sky

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:84%
is one of the reasons
why we built monuments

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:90%
with big stones.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
last a long, long time.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And they all are
looking at the sky.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:84%
They predict eclipses,
meteorites, the calendars.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Maya have calendars
that go forward, what,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:90%
140,000 years?

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Why would a farmer
need a calendar

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
to tell them what's
going to be happening

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:90%
140,000 years from now?

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Because you'd be dead.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.892 align:middle line:90%
You'd be dead a long time.

00:09:02.892 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is have
a few sticks in the ground

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.725 align:middle line:84%
to tell you what the
Earth and the moon

00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:90%
is doing to plant your seeds.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was all to
do with planning,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
knowing how to be planning--
how to plan ahead,

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and also knowing that your
position in the bigger scheme

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:90%
of things--

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:90%
luck favors the prepared.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And some people will not
make it, but some will.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.747 align:middle line:84%
And it's those that will that
you give them the information

00:09:22.747 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they don't
have to start from scratch,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:90%
like children or wild animals.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:90%
You already are prepared.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're here
having this conversation.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You know,
we could have all

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:90%
disappeared 12,000 years ago.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But look at how
we've also evolved.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's always a silver
lining to these stories.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes me
very positive about hearing

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:90%
these stories.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, gosh.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I shouldn't do
this to you, Freddy.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But you just brought up three
or four different things

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
that take us totally
on a different path.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.803 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, this is
totally unusual for us.

00:09:49.803 --> 00:09:52.261 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But maybe just for
my own edification, for kicks,

00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:54.428 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to share
something, Anasazi-- you're

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:90%
talking about the Anasazi.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I was going
to do a documentary

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:90%
with a person I won't name.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But that person had access
to satellite imagery.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were an extreme
hiker in the Southwest.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And the point of
what I'm about to say

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
is that we have these
large catastrophes.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we have these
mini-ages within.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And what he had
discovered from people

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that find all the mysteries
around the Southwest,

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
like Chaco Canyon-- where's
that road lead to, right?

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And why these cliff dwellers and
so forth-- what he discovered

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
is that was an inland
sea not that long ago.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.895 align:middle line:84%
And the Anasazi took off
after that drained, basically.

00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean,
these little mini-events

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.795 align:middle line:84%
have happened that still
remain a mystery to the state.

00:10:36.795 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:90%
But they're not mysterious.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:90%
They're actually quite logical.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
It's hard-- when your
water has drained,

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
you can't ride your
canoe in to your boat

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.153 align:middle line:84%
anymore as you scramble
up a crusty hillside.

00:10:47.153 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, there's one
cairn that I particularly

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.250 align:middle line:90%
like going to.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not an easy hike.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It's five hours
with five gallons

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:90%
of water on your back in Utah.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:90%
But I love the solitude.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at all the
petroglyphs, and their actually

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
lifesize image of
the Shining People,

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:84%
who they call the Lookers
in this part of the world,

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:84%
they're 8 feet tall, which
is exactly how they're

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.475 align:middle line:90%
described around the world.

00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
all the petroglyphs,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.970 align:middle line:84%
they're a consistent 20-odd
feet above the canyon floor,

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
as though the people
that painted them there,

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:90%
they're on water.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were
standing on ground.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.335 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They're on water.

00:11:17.335 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So this answers a
lot of the mysteries

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:84%
that we still maintain in
the Southwest, at least

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:84%
through formal
educational processes.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
They say, oh, it's a mystery.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not a mystery.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:90%
There was--

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:28.831 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ask the locals.

00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was--
yeah, there was land.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:90%
There was water.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, another really quick one.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.512 align:middle line:84%
Just to go back for a moment,
because we haven't talked

00:11:35.512 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
about crop circles,
and since I first

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:84%
met you, 10, 15
years ago, you said

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:84%
you were able to
tell when, because--

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:84%
were you getting
telepathic communications

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
in the day from
the circle makers

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:90%
as to where they would show up?

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
You said you would
know from them

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.117 align:middle line:90%
where they were going to be.

00:11:52.117 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Everything.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what got me to write
my first book really was

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
my association with an
incredibly gifted woman called

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Isabelle Kingston, who's-- you
wouldn't realize by sitting

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:84%
next to her that she's an
incredibly natural psychic.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And she worked with the police,
with the British police.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.827 align:middle line:84%
Incredible-- I mean, they just
spoke to her, cap in hand.

00:12:11.827 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've done
stories on these people.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Let's figure this out.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.962 align:middle line:84%
And she'll give you
the license plate

00:12:15.962 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:90%
number and all of that stuff.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.003 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Real deal.

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And she accidentally
attracted information

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:84%
from this universal
consciousness.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
They call themselves the
Shining People and the Watchers.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And we thought, who?

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be showing
you messengers in your fields

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:90%
about our existence.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be helping
you for this next moment

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.510 align:middle line:90%
of evolution in your Earth time.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And we thought, what
the hell are we smoking?

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that all
the information was right there

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning,
all channeled.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the more I got involved
with it, and people around me

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:84%
got involved, and we
became much more attuned

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
to what was going on,
not just mathematically

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:84%
or in terms of collecting
seeds and doing

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:84%
the usual scientific
stuff, because you've

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
got to do that to bring the
skeptics into the story.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they
won't believe you.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But once you realize
that you're connected

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
to this landscape
of mystery, you

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.270 align:middle line:84%
begin to be much more
clairvoyant with the land.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can download
information,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.020 align:middle line:84%
to the point where it was
actually scary, in a fun way.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So there was one point in 1999
where I could actually predict

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.520 align:middle line:90%
where they were going to be.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be off by only 24 hours,
only a couple of fields away.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:90%
It got down to that point.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was, which they
told us afterwards, of course--

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.263 align:middle line:84%
or the management told us
afterwards-- was that, yeah,

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
we just wanted to let you
know that you can do this.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do this.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has the ability to
communicate on a multi-level--

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
a multidimensional
level of communication.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're just one of
those sources, like many.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So we just want to teach
you that you can do this.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
You can get help
from the outside.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And just because we're no
longer alive and physical

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:90%
in your world--

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
in other words, we're dead,
relative to human people--

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean we can't be useful.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.150 align:middle line:84%
We're still, on another
level, helping you out,

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.035 align:middle line:90%
as we always have.

00:13:53.035 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.828 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You always get help.

00:13:54.828 --> 00:13:56.345 align:middle line:84%
It's called angels
or spirit guides.

00:13:56.345 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Whatever
you want to call it.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:90%
And that is wonderful.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
were really-- you

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and your group were
really dialed in.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, you're saying,
just have some cheese and head

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:90%
north.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And you had beautiful circles in
the southwest happening, right?

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd never heard
that part of your story,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.427 align:middle line:90%
and I think it's very funny.

00:14:09.427 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I love it, how you
were misleading them.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is just one
personal quick question.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:84%
About, I'd say, 8
to 10 years ago,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:84%
there was a crop
circle at Cheesehead,

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:84%
where a bunch of people had
been gathering right nearby

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:84%
for a big outdoor
long weekend concert.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever hear
anything about that one?

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was that real,
or was that a people one?

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Cheesefoot Head.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's it called?

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's pronounced
"Cheese-foot,"

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:90%
but it's actually "Chez-foot."

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cheesefoot, right.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
call it Cheesehead.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: English is a
bloody ridiculous language.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Cheesefoot Head, right.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's been a whole
bunch of them in that thing.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to--

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to sort of
separate the real--

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
there were so many.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Never mind.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:84%
You probably wouldn't
even remember this one.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.083 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's been a
lot of fakes around there.

00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But the ones from the
'70s through to the '90s

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
at Cheesefoot Head
were the real thing.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The ones
that came later--

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
one that I stepped

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:90%
in was just broken grass.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But here's
the-- well, here's

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.153 align:middle line:84%
a double side to the story,
because once I published

00:15:00.153 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
the information-- and someone
said, once you publish

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.760 align:middle line:84%
this stuff, the
hoaxers are going

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.167 align:middle line:84%
to know really how to make
really good crop circles.

00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
improved after that.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.747 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They began
to realize that they

00:15:09.747 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
could overlap their
creations on top of where

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.145 align:middle line:90%
the original ones were.

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So dowsers would go there and
go, hey, I'm getting a hit.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a real one.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
The energy lasts for
six to eight years

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.483 align:middle line:90%
after the real circle's gone.

00:15:21.483 --> 00:15:22.400 align:middle line:90%
It's about the energy.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.435 align:middle line:84%
It's not the-- the shape is
just to get your attention.

00:15:25.435 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So they would put the hoax
overlapping the general area

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:90%
where the original one was.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.183 align:middle line:84%
And you'd think that you were
getting the tingly-wingly--

00:15:32.183 --> 00:15:33.850 align:middle line:84%
very technical term--
the tingly-wingly.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
was from before.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:35.977 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It was from before.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, without the
hindrance that the farmers were

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.990 align:middle line:84%
experiencing-- and
still are, by the way--

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.218 align:middle line:84%
the fact is that the
hoaxes did us a huge favor

00:15:46.218 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
by drawing people to areas where
the energy was really there.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.385 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
would get uplifted.

00:15:50.385 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of the technology

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:90%
that they were using--

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --to uplift
the human being.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:84%
We had healing modalities
that came out of this.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.583 align:middle line:84%
We had increasing crop growth,
which the farmers noted.

00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the real circles--
we know they're real,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.447 align:middle line:84%
because if you plant in
that area afterwards--

00:16:04.447 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Increased yield.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.363 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --the crops
are outgrowing the rest

00:16:07.363 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:90%
of the field by 2 to 1.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So there was actually-- we're
back to the same Shining Ones

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:90%
again--

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.563 align:middle line:84%
the technology's
in the land to show

00:16:13.563 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that, yeah, this
technology can be

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:90%
used to increase your harvest.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And we've used that
technology as well.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
happening now with it?

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, it's
something-- early 2000s,

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:90%
everyone was all over it, '90s.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:90%
What's happening now?

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Mostly hoaxed, sorry.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mostly hoaxed.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm just asking,
because I don't know.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I've kind of dialed out.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.325 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: 99% it's all manmade.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence to show that
there's a real thing going on.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And we were told that
once we're done here,

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and once we've given the
information to people,

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.965 align:middle line:84%
and published the information--
so I feel so used.

00:16:45.965 --> 00:16:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And abused.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.082 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And abused.

00:16:48.082 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:84%
The information
would be out there,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, "humans will
have to figure this out."

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:90%
We've given you the information.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Now it's up to you to work it.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And since, then it's
been mostly manmade.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.887 align:middle line:90%
They've been fine tuning.

00:16:59.887 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But the real circle are really--
they're very simple ones now.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't attract attention
for that very reason,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:84%
because we go there, and
we start arguing about it.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's so and so.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:90%
It's this entity.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
It's that entity.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:90%
It's the government.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:90%
It's this.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.770 align:middle line:90%
It's humans.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but that--
all those emotions

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:84%
are polluting the energy
of what you've got there.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And what you end up
with is negativity.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.619 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So they're
saying, no, we've

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
got to make simple
circles, because people

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:90%
don't get drawn to those.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:90%
They're not eye candy.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:84%
It's because we need to
basically, and I quote again,

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:84%
we need to buy humans time
to figure out-- they're

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of huge changes.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And you need be prepared
for what's coming.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a large
window of opportunity.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But the window is-- now, in
2021, the window is closing.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And the window kind
of closes about 2042,

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.150 align:middle line:84%
according to the
full Mayan calendar.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.472 align:middle line:90%
2012 was just a midpoint.

00:17:47.472 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.347 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So we're now--
the window is closing.

00:17:50.347 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And we have to buy time.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to see changes
in weather, all kinds of things

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the ground,
creating plagues and things,

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.400 align:middle line:90%
because of the warming.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:84%
This is part of
the natural cycle.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:90%
And they warned us about this.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.088 align:middle line:84%
But you need to be
aware that you're

00:18:05.088 --> 00:18:06.130 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of changes.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We're just buying you
time by telling the Earth,

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
don't overwhelm the
humans to such a degree

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.803 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
turn the coach slowly.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Buy them time to get
their act together,

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.248 align:middle line:84%
because they will
figure this out.

00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's saying this
in a positive level.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:90%
They will figure it out.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe that.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And we're pretty close
to hitting a critical mass.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just that's
it's not newsworthy.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:90%
It's positive news.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.632 align:middle line:90%
No, that doesn't make the news.

00:18:29.632 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:90%
If it bleeds, it leads.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not-- so since
we have you on the line,

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
while we kind of move on past
the crop circle thing, which

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:84%
wasn't intended at
all, but I'm very

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
glad we talked about it,
what, in your opinion,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
was the most phenomenal
messaging, maybe the top one

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
or two crop circles
that you recall

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:90%
of just phenomenal messaging?

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.772 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Ask me a
simple question.

00:18:54.772 --> 00:18:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It depends what
you're looking for.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I think now, in
hindsight, I think

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:84%
it's the healing modalities
that would develop out of it.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And we were told that these
things have a potential

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:90%
to heal.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't actually heal.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:84%
They're just
exchanging information

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:84%
from one organism to another,
and it's with the Earth

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:90%
and also with people.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that I've been involved

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:90%
with without advertising this.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.948 align:middle line:90%
It's on my website.

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:90%
But I've never advertised this.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.448 align:middle line:90%
And people are drawn to this.

00:19:20.448 --> 00:19:22.793 align:middle line:84%
And the stuff that I
hear back from people,

00:19:22.793 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:84%
what they've done
with these modalities,

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:90%
are beyond my wildest--

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they using
the actual crop circle

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:90%
image itself?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're using
the actual symbol.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole technology
behind it, which I can't--

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.897 align:middle line:84%
I'm sworn to secrecy
for a lot of reasons,

00:19:34.897 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:90%
not because it's sinister.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:90%
It's because it's supposed to--

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:84%
it's to maintain the integrity
of what was given to us.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to stick to that.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You know, I've been
given a huge responsibility.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm sticking to it.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not deviating from the plan.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And some of the feet back I get
from people is mind blowing.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
But I said, I don't advertise
this for a lot of reasons.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I want people to find
it for themselves.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And there is an exchange of
energy, which is actually

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.087 align:middle line:90%
measurable, between people.

00:20:00.087 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And people have done
extraordinary things with it.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I think there's the single
most incredible thing

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.900 align:middle line:90%
that we've done.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And it harks back
to the time when

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I would talk about this, when
we were doing experiments

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
with seeds and seed
growth as well, because we

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.042 align:middle line:90%
were seeing the same thing.

00:20:14.042 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
The late John Burke, who
was one of the three--

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: John Burke.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --main people involved
with the research-- lovely guy.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful, yeah.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful work.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:90%
He's gone now.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And a lot of this, I'm
going to plagiarize his work--

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --because
he deserves to be--

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He does.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.740 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --have his work shown.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
He developed a technique
along with William Levengood,

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:90%
who's also passed away.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of death
in the crop circle world.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He might still
be in the Gaia archive,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:84%
actually, because I
interviewed him prior to Gaia.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And they have my
original archive.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: He lives forever.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He lives forever, yes.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So they developed
these systems and these--

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
this simple technology
to do this seed growth

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:84%
based on what we learned
from crop circle research.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And then that became
applied onto general healing

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.450 align:middle line:84%
because of the information
we got from our psychic

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
to tell us about how they
interchange information.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and years ago,
when I was in Santa Fe,

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:90%
doing a conference with--

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:90%
oh, what's his name?

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful gentleman from
St. Petersburg, who I adore.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
Konstantin Korotkov.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Thank you.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:12.212 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love him.

00:21:12.212 --> 00:21:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I won't
mention his title,

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:90%
because it's unpronounceable.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he was head of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences,

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:17.930 align:middle line:90%
director at one point.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That's the simple term.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.488 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And he was
actually at my lecture.

00:21:21.488 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to
go to his lecture,

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:90%
because I adore his work.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.833 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I said, yeah, I want
to test those little cards

00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:27.633 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:21:27.633 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:90%
I said, thank you.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, how are
you going to do it?

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Because we have a system.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, you have a system
to measure these things?

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to give you ones
that have not been activated.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.330 align:middle line:90%
So they're just paper and ink.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the other method,

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.180 align:middle line:90%
which is something else.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.248 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't tell them.

00:21:42.248 --> 00:21:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, in five
minutes, you got to read that.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And you've got an aura around
the cards that are activated

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.350 align:middle line:90%
and going, yeah, they're here.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.423 align:middle line:90%
And he developed it.

00:21:49.423 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, thank you
for proving that we knew we

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:90%
we're on the right track here.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I wonder if he--

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.000 align:middle line:10%
he's the one that was
behind the development

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:10%
of the Bio-Well and the GVD.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:10%
That's what that device
became over time.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Wouldn't surprise me.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't surprise me.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
now this is used

00:22:02.815 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
to read subtle energy
fields among thousands

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
of practitioners
around the world.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:08.016 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:22:08.016 --> 00:22:09.710 align:middle line:84%
You can put your
fingers on this machine.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And in five minutes, you've
got a biodynamic reader--

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --of what's
right and wrong with you.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And I tried it.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, yeah.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.187 align:middle line:90%
I know what's wrong with me.

00:22:16.187 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:90%
And absolutely right.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:19.993 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very incredible genius.

00:22:19.993 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not dying
soon, are you?

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Eh?

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not
dying soon, are you?

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.405 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: No, apparently, I'm
destined to be here forever.

00:22:25.405 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to sell my antibodies
to science, because I've

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:10%
survived the plague.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.540 align:middle line:10%
And I've taken huge risks
in the last three years,

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:10%
and apparently
appear to be immune.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very fortunate.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, good.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to hear that part--

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I guess
I must have been--

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because you
have a new book coming out,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
which we'll mention
at the very end here.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But now
maybe we can get

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
to what we were going to
talk about, since we've laid

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:90%
a lovely foundation for it.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:90%
So let's just talk about--

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: This three-hour show.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because we're still
talking about the Shining Ones.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the followers of Horus

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and the agricultural revolution
in Egypt, because again,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:90%
followers of Horus.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about them.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Again, Shining Ones,
followers of Horus, [EGYPTIAN],,

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be-- get
it done professionally.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So 10,800 BC, oh, look
at those big rocks

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the sky,
completely flattened the Earth,

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:84%
begins the Younger
Dryas Ice Age.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, not a good
time to be living.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
These people, usually
groups of seven,

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.688 align:middle line:84%
with one charismatic
leader making the eight,

00:23:22.688 --> 00:23:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and of course, the
woman, who happens

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.403 align:middle line:84%
to be the main wisdom keeper,
so one woman with seven guys.

00:23:27.403 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And she is the
head of everything.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One woman equals
seven guys, I think,

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And that happens all around
the world, oddly enough.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:32.792 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:32.792 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.553 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So they decide
to show up along the Nile.

00:23:35.553 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And would you believe it?

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:84%
300 years later,
they're setting up

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.790 align:middle line:84%
the foundation
of-- what they call

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of the
historic temples, the stuff

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are
going to see today.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And exactly the same
moment, archaeologists

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:84%
are amazed to find there was
an agricultural revolution

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:90%
along the Nile in 10,500 BC--

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:84%
animal husbandry, domestication
of crops, so on and so forth.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and most importantly, beer.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So they set up the
blueprint for what

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.060 align:middle line:84%
was to become a sort of
a foundation, a safety

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:84%
net, an insurance policy,
because they already

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
knew they had 700 years
before the next set of rocks

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:90%
came coming out of the sky.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:84%
They were already planning
for the next stage.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.067 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
everybody survives.

00:24:16.067 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:90%
They knew what was coming.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:90%
They were prepared.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they taught us
how to basically evolve.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you get
these incredible flourishes

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of civilization along the
Nile so early on in history.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So again, they're
doing us a huge favor

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:84%
by sharing what they had already
practiced among themselves

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.830 align:middle line:84%
with ordinary
hunter-gatherers to elevate us

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.858 align:middle line:84%
from our level of barbarity so
we could become just like them.

00:24:36.858 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:90%
And that was their whole point.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.870 align:middle line:84%
They said, you can
do what we're doing.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing godly or magical.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.772 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can rise
to this occasion.

00:24:43.772 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
respect each other

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and stop dragging the women
by the hair into the cave

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.428 align:middle line:90%
and eating animals raw.

00:24:49.428 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:84%
You just don't do
that kind of thing.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.845 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can live--
in fact, most of them

00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:90%
are vegetarians, oddly enough.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:90%
All the gods were vegetarians.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll never be a
god, unfortunately.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm more of the Anthony
Bourdain school of eating.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.010 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they taught us
the basic accoutrements

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.130 align:middle line:84%
of life, astronomy, astrology,
mathematics, geometry,

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and of course, temple
building, which

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
is very important, because it's
the dimensions, proportions,

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and positions of the temples
which allow any diseased person

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:84%
to walk in, look at the
correct harmonics of life,

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:90%
and you walk in as a god.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:84%
You walk out
perfect and upright.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.665 align:middle line:90%
And I do believe that I--

00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I really do believe,
hand on heart,

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
that going to the sacred
places does give you

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:84%
a certain inoculation
against life.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, so far, knock--

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I won't do it, because
it will ruin the audio--

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:90%
knock on wood.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.270 align:middle line:84%
All the people that have
gone to sacred sites

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
with me or on their own,
they've all been pretty healthy.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's something
to be said for that.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.035 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about the harmonic

00:25:47.035 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and the frequency
of these places

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.535 align:middle line:90%
that does something to you.

00:25:49.535 --> 00:25:51.960 align:middle line:84%
It elevates your
body and your spirit.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:90%
So this goes back to 10,500 BC.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
arguably, even before.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.107 align:middle line:84%
Arguably even from the great
continent of Atlantis--

00:25:58.107 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.398 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
followers of Horus.

00:26:00.398 --> 00:26:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this goes as
far back as we go.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.952 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, the King
List start ins 39,000 BC.

00:26:04.952 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Whoops, that's a bit
of a-- never mention the Turin

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:08.285 align:middle line:90%
papyrus--

00:26:08.285 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kings List.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --in front
of archaeologists.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.410 align:middle line:84%
They don't like to
talk about that one.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's interesting,

00:26:12.785 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:84%
because not that many shows are
really done on the Kings List--

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which
does challenge history

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:90%
as it's currently taught.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.482 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's a bit
of a problem when

00:26:21.482 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:84%
you talk about, the first
king is in 39,000 BC.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
venerables of Memphis

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that ruled for
like 26,000 years.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.767 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
followers of Horus

00:26:32.767 --> 00:26:34.410 align:middle line:90%
that ruled for 13,000 years.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So they were partly in Egypt
and partly in different lands

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I think one
of the things that isn't spoken

00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:42.980 align:middle line:84%
about is that ancient
Egypt, ancient ancient

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.755 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, depending
on which tradition

00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:84%
you're following-- in
the hermetic tradition,

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:51.140 align:middle line:84%
they will state that it's
200,000 years old, that culture

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.870 align:middle line:84%
is 200,000, meaning it
was running concurrently

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.070 align:middle line:90%
with Atlantis.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And there was travel of
many kinds at the time,

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.950 align:middle line:90%
as the visitors came and went.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And populations could be
easily taken back and forth.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yeah.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Sumerian King
List goes back even further.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It goes back to
the lords of Anu in Armenia,

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.212 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of--

00:27:11.212 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the lords of
Anu were essentially

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:90%
like the core group.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And they all lived-- they had
their own particular places

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.805 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:27:17.805 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So far, I've figured out they
had seven or eight islands,

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.280 align:middle line:84%
most of them now gone, or places
that behaved like islands.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like they wanted
to live here with us,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:84%
but yet, they wanted to
be separate from humans.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, understandably.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.238 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And sometimes we'll
parcel out the information.

00:27:30.238 --> 00:27:31.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going over there.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Toss them a bone
and run back and hide.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.958 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They
haven't got any beer.

00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:35.990 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:84%
No, and again, they were-- it
was from them that they were--

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:84%
once in a while, they would
leach out this information

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and a certain prescribed method
to give human hunter-gatherers

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.637 align:middle line:90%
the chance to elevate.

00:27:47.637 --> 00:27:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And they knew-- they
had the foresight

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.137 align:middle line:84%
to understand that too
much information in one

00:27:51.137 --> 00:27:52.710 align:middle line:90%
go is not a good thing.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:84%
You have to have not
just the understanding,

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.828 align:middle line:84%
but the experience of what
you do with the knowledge.

00:27:56.828 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, too much knowledge
with an inexperienced body

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.423 align:middle line:84%
can lead to all
kinds of problems.

00:28:01.423 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at what we do
with technology nowadays.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
We have a wonderful
computer to either tell us

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.120 align:middle line:84%
what the weather is or help
us do some word processing.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:84%
But then look what's
also being done with it

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:84%
as well-- the snooping,
the Pegasus scandal that

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.570 align:middle line:84%
just came out as well with
the snooping around the world.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, this is very new
stuff among the human race.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.785 align:middle line:84%
And we're really
learning to abuse it.

00:28:24.785 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think they knew--
they had the foresight

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to understand that you
drip feed the information,

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.152 align:middle line:84%
not because you're
trying to control people.

00:28:31.152 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It's because they have
to take the information,

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:84%
explore it, and develop
a sense of integrity.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And from integrity comes
knowledge, and development,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and responsibility.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.398 align:middle line:84%
From that, you
grow as a species.

00:28:42.398 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So it tells me that the people
that we're dealing with,

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that were giving us all these
accouterments of civilization,

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:84%
really understood the
mechanics of psychology--

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, they did.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --at a very,
very little degree.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not
only that, the cycles

00:28:53.095 --> 00:28:54.397 align:middle line:90%
of development of species.

00:28:54.397 --> 00:28:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Which goes back
to why they were so long.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This had
been observed before.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And as Barbara-- I was
talking with Barbara Hand Clow

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.700 align:middle line:90%
recently.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying, there's no
way to avoid where we're going.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
This whole notion of cosmic
consciousness, cosmic contact,

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
is inevitable as we move
into the age of Aquarius.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.610 align:middle line:84%
The age of Pisces
kept us more or less

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:90%
trapped in this patriarchal--

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
form and structure.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
inventiveness during that time.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But now it's time
to move beyond it

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and quit trying to
essentially own it.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.443 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've been-- yeah,
we've been through this before.

00:29:27.443 --> 00:29:30.260 align:middle line:84%
We had the time before that,
where everything from like 8000

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to 2000 BC was a lunar
worship society, mostly

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:84%
around the world, so very
female-based culture.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet that got
out of control too,

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:84%
which is what ushers
in the male solar--

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.677 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us how
that got out of control.

00:29:42.677 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Basically, it's
the same human construct.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:90%
We like a good thing.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.760 align:middle line:84%
We started getting
addicted to it.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, you got power.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.637 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't
want to give it up.

00:29:50.637 --> 00:29:52.805 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
control that was going on.

00:29:52.805 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing happened
with the women as well.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:90%
So the men start taking over.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But paradoxically, you also had
the same problems with climate.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So we had 13 known catastrophes
between the Ice Age and today.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.950 align:middle line:90%
We know these happened.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them happened in
the last 2,000 years as well.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So we are not immune to ice ages
or rocks coming out of the sky.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:84%
But each time it
happens, there's

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.500 align:middle line:90%
a moment where we sit down.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.292 align:middle line:84%
We lose a certain amount
of the population.

00:30:20.292 --> 00:30:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And we take stock
of what's going on.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.130 align:middle line:84%
But that's also tied into
what the Chinese were saying.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The sky, and people,
and the way they act--

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.540 align:middle line:90%
they're not separate things.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.153 align:middle line:84%
Human thought interacts with
the sky and the weather.

00:30:32.153 --> 00:30:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And the weather also
interacts with the people

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:90%
and their behavior.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's a loop system.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So if we are getting
out of control

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:84%
on a heart level
and a mind level,

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.542 align:middle line:90%
the weather reacts accordingly.

00:30:42.542 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
affecting the Earth.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.185 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And catastrophes
are drawn to people.

00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So you have a
group of, let's say, women,

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:84%
or men working with
female principles, that

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:84%
are taking this out of
proportion, out of balance.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:54.900 align:middle line:90%
The weather reiterates.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.470 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, you say, right.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a bunch of
guys and women saying,

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.380 align:middle line:84%
we're going to use solar,
masculine power, because that

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.310 align:middle line:90%
didn't work too well.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:90%
It didn't end too well.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.138 align:middle line:90%
Let's try this new method.

00:31:06.138 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning,
it works really well.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in balance.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in harmony.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And in 2021, look
at where we are.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:84%
We've exhausted
that possibility.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:84%
We've taken the solar,
masculine energy

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.377 align:middle line:84%
to a completely new level
of stupidity, I'm sorry.

00:31:21.377 --> 00:31:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stupidity.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Really.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the
second-most abundant--

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beyond
destruction, just stupidity.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --element
in the universe.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
going, perhaps it's

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.610 align:middle line:84%
time to recalibrate and
look at where we are.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we have new
progressive ideas coming

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:90%
into the political spectrum.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.207 align:middle line:90%
We have new inventions.

00:31:35.207 --> 00:31:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Women are rising
back into positions of power.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Women are rising back.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's not really
about gender.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.073 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more
about people working

00:31:41.073 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:90%
with a feminine concept.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because men
are doing it too.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of male healers
are coming to the fore.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We have new technology
coming to the fore.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, we have the
roots of a new development.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the Ice
Age all over again.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:84%
We can see the ends of
something big happening.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But we've already got the
carpet that is taking us

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.250 align:middle line:90%
to somewhere more positive.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's that
midsection that's important.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.505 align:middle line:84%
We have to ride that wave
of destruction elegantly.

00:32:06.505 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the thing
is, we have certain--

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're ignorant
as to our interaction

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.040 align:middle line:84%
with and our effect
upon the natural world.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, I mean, just what
you brought up-- the notion

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that our own development and
emotions affect the weather.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Our own emotions and
development affect Earth changes

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and the stability of the
Earth, because the Earth's

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
emotional body is woven
in with our field.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't
separate these things out.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is woven
in with the atmosphere.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very
important, what you just said.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really
talk about it much.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our own
thoughts, and character,

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual development do
have an effect on these things.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.767 align:middle line:84%
Any Buddhist will
understand this,

00:32:48.767 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:90%
anybody that practices Zen.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Ask the Zuni or the
Hopi, the Waithaha.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Any of these
indigenous people will

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:90%
say exactly the same thing.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.580 align:middle line:84%
You're not separate
from anything.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Once you start getting into the
concept of nature's out there,

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here, or god is
out there, and I'm here,

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.410 align:middle line:84%
you're really lost,
because you are god.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:06.220 align:middle line:90%
You are nature.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.650 align:middle line:84%
You are an embodiment of
all of these natural things.

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So for you to behave
according to your environment

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.420 align:middle line:84%
is to adapt and to listen
to what's going on.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And once you listen,
it doesn't mean that--

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.010 align:middle line:84%
you can lessen the outcome
of what's going to happen.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Changes will
still be upon you.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:21.460 align:middle line:90%
But you can ride it elegantly.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
you can soften it.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.085 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You can soften it.

00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like a-- surfing actually
has all the answers to this.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen this.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I understand, having been at
Asilomar and watched surfing.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.272 align:middle line:84%
And I go, that's exactly how
everything really should be.

00:33:34.272 --> 00:33:36.730 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at the wave,
and you're going, not that one.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Not that one.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Just this one.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it as
a non-surfer, you think,

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.073 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't look healthy.

00:33:44.073 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:84%
That's going to crush my
bones when that wave comes.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And look
at the way they

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:84%
blend with the water
in complete rhythm.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They understand what
the water's doing.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.333 align:middle line:84%
And the water understands
that the surfer's there.

00:33:53.333 --> 00:33:56.230 align:middle line:84%
The two are wrapped in each
other in this beautiful sort

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:90%
of bowel.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:59.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a really
elegant thing to see.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So something
as simple as surfing

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:84%
answers the reason
why we're here

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
supposed to be doing.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.980 align:middle line:90%
You've got a big wave.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.147 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, you can ride it.

00:34:07.147 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can reach the
beach and then have a beer

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and hang out with
some seals, you know?

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, OK, yes.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I was going to pick
out a couple of places,

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.100 align:middle line:84%
because we can put some
lovely visuals in with them.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the
Isle of Lewis, OK?

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.679 align:middle line:84%
Because here, we're talking
about this agricultural process

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.199 align:middle line:84%
again, using the
currents and such.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to
John Burke's work.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:30.758 align:middle line:84%
And what they knew at
the time, what they

00:34:30.758 --> 00:34:33.100 align:middle line:84%
were doing at the
time to advance this.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.830 align:middle line:10%
And I'm bringing it up,
because I know you've just

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:10%
written a book on Armenia.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:10%
And this goes into
very similar stones

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.630 align:middle line:10%
for the same purpose
of charging seeds,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:47.500 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, purifying
water, in Armenia.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.460 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to talk
about your new work, OK?

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
Isle of Lewis, OK?

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.679 align:middle line:90%
For this modern organic farming.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Around the world.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to go there.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Then we're going to Armenia--

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.530 align:middle line:84%
same stones used for
water purification.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, there's a lot
of standing stones in the Isle

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.955 align:middle line:84%
of Lewis, in Orkney, all
those islands around Scotland.

00:35:08.955 --> 00:35:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are things there
that shouldn't be there.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.308 align:middle line:84%
And archaeologists
actually agree with that.

00:35:13.308 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:84%
We're finding an
agreement about something.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.342 align:middle line:90%
These things don't belong.

00:35:16.342 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny,
because they become

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.790 align:middle line:84%
the center of these
agricultural communities.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And you see this around
the world as well.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Whenever there's
a sacred center--

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and a standing stone-- it
can't be any simpler than that,

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:84%
really-- this beautiful
monolith, usually aligned

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:32.830 align:middle line:84%
with a straight
face to something.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And around it,
agriculture just seems

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.480 align:middle line:84%
to develop in a very
unusual pattern.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It seems to grow better
than anywhere else.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've discovered this
same process was happening

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.100 align:middle line:90%
in Armenia in about 5000 BC.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.360 align:middle line:90%
And this is all new stuff.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't hear much
about this part of the world--

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you don't
hear Armenia at all.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --because there's
so much warfare that's

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:51.955 align:middle line:90%
been going on around there.

00:35:51.955 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And I love that
part of the world.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I developed a huge
affinity with the culture.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've just discovered
that back in the day, which

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:84%
covers a long period
of time, they were

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:90%
putting these large rocks--

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about
15-foot-tall monoliths.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they would be shaped
like a bull or a fish head,

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:84%
inside a cave, where
the spring that

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:84%
would furnish the water
to all the local villagers

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.220 align:middle line:90%
used to come from.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea was
that the stone-- there's

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.738 align:middle line:84%
some quality about it
that purified the water.

00:36:24.738 --> 00:36:26.030 align:middle line:90%
So you never touched the stone.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.380 align:middle line:90%
You went there and prayed.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:90%
And you gave your blessing.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.110 align:middle line:90%
But you never touched the stone.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, did
the springs run out

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.500 align:middle line:90%
from underneath the stone?

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yes.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And around the stones?

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And around the stone.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So it turns out that
the stone itself had certain

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:42.680 align:middle line:84%
properties, metallic properties
and crystalline properties,

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that when you put your
intent into the stone,

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.340 align:middle line:90%
just like you telling--

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.060 align:middle line:84%
hitting Command-F tells the
computer to do something.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're sending a command
to silica in your computer.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, your thought pattern
also can tell the same

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:90%
to the silica in the stone.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And they programmed
the stone to say,

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:84%
right, your job,
stone, is to make sure

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that the electromagnetic
frequency that runs across

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:09.620 align:middle line:84%
at this site stays here, because
the electromagnetic frequency,

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.370 align:middle line:84%
called the telluric current,
has a certain shielding property

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.770 align:middle line:84%
on the water, which means
it's going to purify it.

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the best water filter
you're ever going to get.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you protect
springs, holy wells.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Even to this very day
in the Celtic world,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.540 align:middle line:84%
you see those houses, and
the Isle of Lewis as well.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a tradition
called well dressing,

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.990 align:middle line:84%
which was putting certain
stones of a granitic force.

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And the granite has a
kind of natural radiation

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.150 align:middle line:90%
to it, very natural.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And it just cleans
out the bacteria.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.640 align:middle line:90%
So there's a method to this.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, fast forward many
thousands of years.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.055 align:middle line:90%
You have this system.

00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was the
Perelandra system that

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:49.580 align:middle line:90%
began this in America.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was other
people that were offshoots

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.048 align:middle line:84%
of this system,
where they actually

00:37:53.048 --> 00:37:56.180 align:middle line:84%
developed the same
ability to develop

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.490 align:middle line:90%
a system using copper tubes--

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:01.430 align:middle line:84%
great conductor-- and they
would arrange these tubes

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:05.510 align:middle line:84%
in a certain geometry, usually
in a seven-pointed star,

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.300 align:middle line:84%
according to a certain
height and a certain width.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And that geometry, which just
happens to be the slope angle

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:14.150 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid--
surprise, surprise--

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.850 align:middle line:84%
anything that grew
within a 20-foot radius

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:19.220 align:middle line:84%
of that little
construction in your garden

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:84%
would outgrow anything
by about 2 to 1,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.070 align:middle line:84%
just like John Burke's
little machine,

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:84%
just like the seeds from
the crop circles that also,

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.450 align:middle line:84%
when we did these
seed experiments,

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:31.640 align:middle line:84%
would outgrow
everything by 2 to 1.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is a technology that's
based on natural laws that

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.990 align:middle line:84%
helps to induce growth
in plants at a time

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:41.600 align:middle line:84%
when you might need it--
say, after a catastrophe,

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:84%
or because you've got a
huge population explosion.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, this is a
very, very old technology.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:84%
It was really being done by
our hunter-gatherer friends.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, interestingly,
you have learned how to speak

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.870 align:middle line:84%
an archaic language--
or not speak,

00:38:56.870 --> 00:39:00.470 align:middle line:84%
but you have learned how to
read and decipher the Armenian

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:03.590 align:middle line:84%
language to the extent you're
writing this new book with

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.370 align:middle line:90%
discoveries that are fresh--

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and new--

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.227 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because this
is something we don't know,

00:39:10.227 --> 00:39:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and the link between
Northern Scotland

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.180 align:middle line:90%
and the islands off the coast.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Without giving too
much information away,

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.152 align:middle line:90%
it goes back to something--

00:39:18.152 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
started in Sardinia?

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Did you start really
getting piqued--

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It started in Scotland.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --when we
were in Sardinia, or--

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.205 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It really
began with Scotland,

00:39:24.205 --> 00:39:26.222 align:middle line:90%
and really taking notes, and--

00:39:26.222 --> 00:39:27.680 align:middle line:84%
because I love it
up there, really.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.805 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't for the fact
that it was so far north,

00:39:29.805 --> 00:39:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have much
of a sun in the winter,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and it would drive me
nuts, I would move there.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, no, I love
the Scottish Highlands.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.460 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I feel very at home.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.240 align:middle line:90%
And I began to observe things.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, these things
don't belong there.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:90%
And I made notes.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:90%
So we went to Sardinia.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And we were walking around in
the rain, ironically enough.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this,
going, wait a minute.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
were over in Scotland.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.110 align:middle line:90%
What's the connection?

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was the same concept.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Where does it come from,
and why is it in Sardinia?

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.500 align:middle line:84%
They call this the
Nuragic culture.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's not one person
in the whole of Sardinia

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.580 align:middle line:84%
that could explain
what Nuragic means.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:90%
So what does it mean?

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't know.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So you have a name that
defines an entire country

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:90%
and civilization.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know
what it means?

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:12.950 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking to local
language, like in Malta,

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.252 align:middle line:84%
and found the connection,
traced that back to Armenia.

00:40:20.252 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh,
that's interesting.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So the origin of these things
in Sardinia is in Armenia.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like, again, the
management drops in the picture

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.710 align:middle line:90%
and goes, idiot.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.755 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you have
a look at Scotland?

00:40:32.755 --> 00:40:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I got a hold
of this Armenian-English

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:84%
dictionary, the only
one in the country.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I start looking up words
in Scottish and Gaelic.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.530 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, ah.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's interesting.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it, I
am making friends in Armenia

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.560 align:middle line:90%
through Facebook.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
interesting people too,

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:50.660 align:middle line:90%
historians and archaeologists.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.240 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, yeah, we can
help you with the language.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were helping me
with me making up words

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:56.690 align:middle line:90%
from a dictionary.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'd send them the words.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And I say, does this
actually mean something?

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.658 align:middle line:90%
They said, actually, it does.

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:01.934 align:middle line:90%
It means, la, la, la, la, la.

00:41:01.934 --> 00:41:02.963 align:middle line:90%
I said, thank you.

00:41:02.963 --> 00:41:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you just realize you
just described these temples

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:90%
in Scotland?

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.118 align:middle line:84%
So I can't tell you anymore,
because it's kind of exciting.

00:41:11.118 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I never would have figured
that to understand Scotland,

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.752 align:middle line:84%
you have to go via
Sardinia into Armenia.

00:41:15.752 --> 00:41:17.460 align:middle line:84%
But it gives me a
different understanding

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:84%
of a very ancient
culture, which is

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:22.960 align:middle line:84%
where, ironically, the
Shining Ones originated from.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:23.810 align:middle line:90%
This is getting interesting.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's like we're
getting back full circle again

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.570 align:middle line:90%
to this ancient culture.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And what were they doing up
in that part of the world?

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they were
regrowing civilization

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.208 align:middle line:84%
at a time when the
Gulf Stream was

00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:36.000 align:middle line:84%
beginning to warm up
that part of the world

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.530 align:middle line:90%
after a big catastrophe.

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the whole
of the agricultural system

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.620 align:middle line:90%
of Britain begins.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And it goes towards England and
the whole of Northern Europe.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So again, out of catastrophe, we
get this wonderful flourishing

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:48.210 align:middle line:90%
of help.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.412 align:middle line:84%
In fact, let's finish
up on just one.

00:41:50.412 --> 00:41:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, we didn't get
to most of this.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:52.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.390 align:middle line:90%
We will.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.875 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to--

00:41:54.875 --> 00:41:56.250 align:middle line:84%
you'll come back
in a few months,

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and we'll do the
Armenian news story.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.190 align:middle line:90%
But the bubonic plague--

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.052 align:middle line:84%
you sent those
notes to me on that.

00:42:04.052 --> 00:42:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean, it's
like 400 years ago.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're living
in the world, we

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.230 align:middle line:84%
had bubonic plague,
which wiped off what?

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Half of the human population?

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.070 align:middle line:90%
And what did we get out of this?

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.750 align:middle line:90%
The Renaissance.

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.653 align:middle line:90%
That's not a bad trade-off, OK?

00:42:17.653 --> 00:42:20.070 align:middle line:84%
If you forget the whole problem
with death and all of that

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and look at human civilization
in a bigger scheme of things,

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.090 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment
you were born,

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.460 align:middle line:90%
you're already dying anyway.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You know, the
clock is already ticking.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's part of life.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's part
of the process.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, we got
the Renaissance.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up with this,
where we are right now.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, even though
things might seem dark,

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.180 align:middle line:90%
just focus on the good things.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's your foundation for
getting you to where you are

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and to overcoming
all these problems.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:45.933 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
develop your toolbox.

00:42:45.933 --> 00:42:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why I
wanted to do this show.

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, not
only do we become more--

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:51.630 align:middle line:90%
what is it?

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Necessity is the mother
of invention, right?

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.960 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Many people's
lives were changed.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:00.550 align:middle line:84%
There was personal upheaval
and many new priorities--

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --greater
understanding.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Some inventiveness
came into our lives

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:06.900 align:middle line:90%
as a result, which I think is--

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.340 align:middle line:90%
I love to see that.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.290 align:middle line:84%
It makes me sad when I
hear people just say,

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I just want to get back
so the malls are open.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.320 align:middle line:90%
That's like, ah--

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you missed
an opportunity here

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.090 align:middle line:90%
for a little bit of growth.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean, I've
done four documentaries

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.130 align:middle line:90%
and written a book.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:21.370 align:middle line:10%
But I just didn't sit there
getting fat on television.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:23.587 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I actually
got proactive.

00:43:23.587 --> 00:43:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I thought, I can't do this.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.670 align:middle line:90%
But I can probably do this.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, it's like, oh.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I can become proactive.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to find your
toolbox and make it positive,

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.240 align:middle line:84%
because we're the ones
we're waiting for.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are the
ones we're waiting for.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We have to
help ourselves and be--

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not
only that-- yes.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.380 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --support each other.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.758 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have others
helping us too that might just

00:43:41.758 --> 00:43:42.600 align:middle line:90%
be--

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.280 align:middle line:84%
have a little more knowledge
in certain areas that we

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.180 align:middle line:90%
need to develop right now--

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The management.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --management--
and help us here.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:49.860 align:middle line:90%
So I agree.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.710 align:middle line:10%
I wanted for you to share
this for that reason.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Freddy, thank you so much.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Always fun.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm really looking
forward to our next interview

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:90%
when the new book is out.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, it's
going to be juicy.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds
really exciting.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:43:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's going to be juicy.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.577 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
love the Shining Ones.

00:44:01.577 --> 00:44:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I just love following the way
they've moved around the planet

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.265 align:middle line:84%
and helped humanity
in so many ways.

00:44:06.265 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
learn more about them.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they've got a
wicked sense of humor as well.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll talk about
that in the next show.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Freddy.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.047 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The humor
of the Shining Ones.

00:44:15.047 --> 00:44:17.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: For more of
Freddy's research and books,

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.310 align:middle line:10%
and there are a lot of them, you
can go to invisibletemple.com.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.350 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
