>>SALICROW: Even
if you're a medium,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.900 align:middle line:84%
you can still be taken back
by the actual act of death.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Because just like
birth, it's intense.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Most people are like
a tealight candle,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and that light in the darkness
allows their loved ones

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:90%
to find them.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:84%
A medium is more like a
torch, or a developed medium

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:90%
might be like a lighthouse.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to make it really clear
about the topic of suicide.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not an answer.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't go to
hell, like the church

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:90%
made people believe for years.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
But what does happen
is that people

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:90%
you love experience hell.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I have done a lot of end
of life work with people.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And usually, my first
question when I come in

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:90%
is like, why are you still here?

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.725 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I think we would all

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:10%
agree that the way we approach
death in the Western world

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:10%
is essentially primitive,
even mechanical.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
Through the work of
mediums, such as Salicrow,

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%
we get a deeper glimpse
into the realities

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening just
beyond our field of vision,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
a world teeming with
life and new possibility.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And rather than feeling the
desperation of separation,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:84%
we can open our hearts and minds
and connect with our loved ones

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:90%
in transition and after.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Salicrow.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.817 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you again.

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.317 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be back.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so
congratulations on writing

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:90%
your new book.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:10%
And really, right now, it's
such an interesting time

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:10%
because they call
it, in the articles,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:10%
in the media, a new category
called excessive death.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And this has ticked
up ever since COVID

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
for a variety of
reasons, as we know.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.103 align:middle line:84%
And also, it seems to
be a spirit of the time

00:01:50.103 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and the transition
of Earth, where

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of excess
suicides as well.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
get into all of that.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's start with
some personal experience,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
which is your sister
and your dad's death.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:84%
So my dad came back from
California to Vermont.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:10%
My sister and I
brought him back,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:10%
when he was becoming more ill.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:10%
He was a Vietnam vet, so he had
a lot of complications, COPD.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:10%
And we knew-- we kept
getting this feeling,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:10%
like his time was coming.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:10%
So when he came back,
my sister actually

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:10%
went through the effort
of educating my father

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:10%
on dying to make it easier.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of stress for people

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:84%
when they're ill around
the act of dying,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:84%
around being able
to release into it.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why, sometimes we
have people who get stuck,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and they are in terrible
physical conditions.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they have
extreme dementia,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.213 align:middle line:84%
and they can't
really cross over.

00:02:58.213 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
When it's something
like dementia,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:84%
it's harder to
then educate them.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, of course.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: But with somebody
who has a problem that is like

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.062 align:middle line:84%
cancer, or COPD,
or just old age--

00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where you're
lucid, but it's chronic,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.095 align:middle line:90%
and it's continuing.

00:03:14.095 --> 00:03:14.928 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Exactly.

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So when he came back,
one of the things she did

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:84%
was, she started doing
journey work with him.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And for people who aren't
familiar with journey work,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:90%
it's guided meditation.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of her
focus was simply

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:84%
on bringing him
outside of his body

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:84%
and getting him
comfortable with the idea

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that his spirit and his
body were separate things.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So that when his
time of passing came,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't have that
knee jerk reaction.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I think people have
that, that it's very much--

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of spirits
will talk about this.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
That when we almost
fall asleep, and we

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.630 align:middle line:84%
catch ourselves
and our body jerks,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
some people when
they're dying, once they

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:84%
realize they're dying, they're
starting to leave their body,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and they have that
same reaction.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And they pull themselves
back into their body,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.050 align:middle line:84%
which makes it harder
for them to cross over.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think, also, for the
people who are with them,

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
if a loved one is
with them, often, they

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.659 align:middle line:84%
choose to sneak away
when no one's looking.

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For obvious reasons.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
But that adrenaline hit, it
takes on the other person.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I just lost my father, and my
sister has seen quite a bit

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:90%
of death.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And he literally
took his last breath

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
a couple of minutes
before I could get there,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
knowing the way I'm wired, that
it would take more adrenaline,

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:90%
and I don't make it.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:90%
And that causes problems.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Even
if you're a medium,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
you can still be taken back
by the actual act of death.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Because just like
birth, it's intense.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very intense.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- I think that
this gives us all permission

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they
have the final say.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
He talked to my niece,
and she talked to him.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And then my sister
said, dad, don't go.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Don't go.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:90%
She's almost here.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:90%
I was at the guard's desk.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no,
it's fine to talk to.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And for my niece,
she could handle it.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:90%
My sister could handle it.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:90%
I can't handle it.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So in that little two-minute
gap, popped out of the body.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.697 align:middle line:84%
And it was really a--
grace-filled in that way

00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
because I actually could
not have handled it

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:90%
very well that day.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think it
gives permission for us

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:90%
to say everything's in order.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Because so many
people feel like,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be there and hold
their hand at the last second,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.925 align:middle line:90%
the last breath.

00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:37.725 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:90%
They may not need that from you.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.175 align:middle line:90%
You may be holding them back.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:42.975 align:middle line:90%
Exactly

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:44.642 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: That
actually happens a lot,

00:05:44.642 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and it comes up a lot in
spirit communication sessions.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Because, like you said,
people will feel guilty

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
after someone's
passed, and they will

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
think that they did a disservice
because they didn't make it

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:90%
there in time.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that happens, often,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning of a spirit
communication session,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
if that was the case, is
the dead loved one saying,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
no, I waited for you
to leave the room.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Or I went
when right before you

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:84%
got there because I couldn't
die with you watching me.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is such a
grace in all of it.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is supposed to
be there will be there.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is not
will not be there.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And more often than
not, especially

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
with the elderly, who are
prepared on a spirit level,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:90%
they go as soon as you're gone.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And especially like
2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:90%
No nurses.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.482 align:middle line:90%
Just clean break.

00:06:36.482 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Time to go.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.898 align:middle line:84%
Well, the 3:00 in
the morning thing

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:84%
is an interesting thing, too,
because the Earth actually

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:84%
gives off more radiation on ley
lines or like solar radiation.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people will
have a spirit contact

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:90%
at that time of day.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
also aids when people

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
are leaving the
body because they

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
have that extra boost of energy
to help them kind of get where

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:90%
they're going.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to get into
communication with our loved

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:90%
ones.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.892 align:middle line:84%
I just held my dad's
hand and just said,

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:90%
I'll come looking for--

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:90%
I'll be looking for you.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.562 align:middle line:84%
You come looking for
me when I'm ready.

00:07:10.562 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't been
quite ready yet.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:90%
It's too new.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But I very much look forward to
having conversations because I

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:90%
can feel him all around.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is a lovely
feeling when they're happy.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Definitely.

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:25.817 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's not how it
usually goes with most people

00:07:25.817 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:90%
because we're in the West.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
We have a severe avoidance of
death and fear of the process.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Because, somehow, the
flesh suit holds more sway

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:90%
than the spirit.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
needs to happen in the West,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our
understanding of this.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I actually talk
about this a lot.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that one of the problems
was in the 1950s and '60s,

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
we really sought to homogenize
what it meant to be American,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and we showed that
through television.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:90%
These are the images.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I say, it's like the "Leave
it to Beaver" version of,

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
we get two weeks of casseroles,
a wake, and a funeral,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:90%
and you're supposed to be OK.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
most of our traditions

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
actually came from our
ancestors, which, in the United

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:90%
States, are from everywhere.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So we let go of, maybe,
our family traditions

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and took up this view,
this sterilized view

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:84%
of death happening
behind hospital doors,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
where we should see
very little of it.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Wakes used to be three days
of sitting with the dead.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And now, they are a couple
of hours of visiting hours.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you just
said one key word.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that our
ancestors died at home.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, because of,
really, litigation potential,

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:90%
we're not allowed to do that.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Some
states, you are.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Vermont has a lot of--

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:90%
which is the state I'm from.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Vermont has a lot of leeway
of people dying at home.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a medical
professional oversee it.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But once the person
is proven dead,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:84%
you can even bring them
to a crematorium yourself

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:90%
instead of using an undertaker.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow,
California, it's going

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to be weeks before you can
even go to the crematorium.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:90%
There are so many excess deaths.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.022 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
reasons why I think

00:09:28.022 --> 00:09:33.028 align:middle line:84%
that things like death doulas
are becoming more important,

00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
education around that.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we are running
out of the ability

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
to handle the amount of
death that we do have.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important to
educate yourself about death

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and what you can do about death
before you get to the point

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:90%
where it's there.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.408 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
want to look at it,

00:09:51.408 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to talk about it.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So because we're so
uncomfortable talking about it,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how
to prepare ourselves

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:90%
for when it does happen.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I've had the fortune of being
present in death many times,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.100 align:middle line:90%
and I do consider it a fortune.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I see it as being the same
as being there for birth,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:90%
which is a miraculous thing.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
one thing that comes up.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:84%
No one wants to see
another person suffer.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
what age the person is,

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:84%
if they are ill, to the point
where they're clearly not going

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:84%
to make another serious
event of any kind,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and they have a do
not resuscitate,

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
for example, how
could it work, where

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:84%
we could have a person at home
and have morphine administered

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:90%
at home, so they're not in pain?

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all they
do in the hospital.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.232 align:middle line:84%
They put machines on
them and hook them up

00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:90%
to a morphine drip--

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.097 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Getting
involved with things

00:10:49.097 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:90%
like hospice and home health.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.233 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So hospice can
do morphine administration.

00:10:54.233 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Yes,
because there are

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:84%
people who do morphine
administration at home.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
in all states,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
but it is legal, usually, have
a visiting nurse that's coming

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:90%
and supervising the medication.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
The family-- usually,
it's done through an IV.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But the family is
trained, often,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:84%
in how to care for people
at the end of life.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:90%
This might not be in all states.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that,
a lot of times, people

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:84%
don't know what they're
capable of doing until they're

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:90%
put in that position.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody said
to you, hey, could you

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:84%
administer morphine to
your dying loved one?

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:90%
You might say, no.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
But once you're in
that moment, people

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
grow leaps and
bounds when they're

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.575 align:middle line:90%
facing end of life and death.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially when
pain is clearly involved.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Exactly.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:90%
This isn't for everything.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But when somebody is
suffering, the main goal

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:90%
is to keep them from suffering.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In more ancient
times and in among Indigenous

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:84%
peoples, did they
have their own elixirs

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:84%
of sorts, that would help
people through the process,

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:90%
like morphine?

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's face it.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Opiates of all kinds have
been around for a long time.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
so much what was

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
administered at the end of
life in different cultures.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I do know that we
didn't force ourselves

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:90%
to live as long as we do.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Because in all truth, one of
the other epidemics we have

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:84%
is in nursing homes and people
who are being kept alive

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:90%
with no quality of life.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Terrible.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a fair amount of that
in the last couple of years.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just, my heart,
just breaks, thinking,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:90%
I know you're trapped.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:90%
I see these other people.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
My dad wasn't the case,
but a lot of people

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.258 align:middle line:84%
trapped inside a body
that's all but unresponsive.

00:12:47.258 --> 00:12:49.300 align:middle line:84%
They can swallow their
food, but that's about it.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a really kind
of tricky subject.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if our animals were
in that case, we would have--

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Assist them.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.973 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: We would
assist them in passing,

00:13:01.973 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and we would feel
comfortable doing

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:90%
so because it's acceptable.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:84%
We struggle with that
acceptance in our own lives.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
a lot of maturity

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be gained in the
West, surrounding this subject,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of practical
education that needs

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:90%
to happen like you just said.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.783 align:middle line:90%
So we're prepared.

00:13:24.783 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
We know what to
do if this happens

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:84%
versus this, if it's acute,
if it's quick, if it's slow,

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I think that's--
suffice it to say, we need to.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Because, honestly, the
hospitals and the funeral homes,

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.735 align:middle line:84%
really, are overwhelmed
and can't really

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:90%
help us much anymore.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:90%
They're all broken.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: It's
all of our systems.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
All of our systems.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.930 align:middle line:84%
The ambulatory emergency
systems are also overwhelmed.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So we really do, if we
want to have quality

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
of life for our
loved ones, we have

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
to start educating
ourselves about that.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And even for ourselves
someday, knowing what we want.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And coming up with
that idea that death

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:84%
isn't something that we
should all be afraid of.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:84%
We need to change
our view of that.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So in your book, you spoke of
monsters slain and overcoming

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.730 align:middle line:90%
monsters of pain and regret.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
during the dying process.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:90%
What did you mean by that?

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Well, I think that
one of the things that keeps

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:84%
people stuck, if you will,
when somebody is dying,

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of people,
especially if they have a long

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:90%
death--

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:84%
quick death has its gifts,
but processing your stuff

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:36.880 align:middle line:90%
is not one of them.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Long deaths give us the time to
process and look at the things

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that we've overcome, the
things that we regret.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have done a lot of end
of life work with people.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And usually, my first
question when I come in

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle line:90%
is, why are you still here?

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:90%
What is keeping you here?

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:84%
What pieces haven't
you processed?

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Which pieces haven't you
overcome that are holding you

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:90%
in this place?

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Because there
usually is something,

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.280 align:middle line:84%
whether that creates a fear
because they have regrets

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
over things that
they did, maybe they

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:84%
have somebody that
they really needed

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:84%
to connect with before
that time of crossing came.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But those things are
usually the big monsters

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
that hold people in
place and keep them

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:90%
from being able to move forward.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we,
as their loved ones,

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
could approach them with a
sense of grace and acceptance,

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and let that be known
that there is no judgment.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:90%
We've all done things we regret.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that you
need to get off your chest,

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:84%
or need to share, or wish
to at this time, would that

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:90%
be helpful--

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.825 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah, for sure.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.992 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to invite people
to unburden themselves?

00:15:52.992 --> 00:15:54.908 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Most people
don't feel comfortable

00:15:54.908 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:90%
talking about death.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody is
dying, they don't

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:84%
know how to approach
even talking about it.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how to say to
the person, like you just said,

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:90%
it's OK.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.135 align:middle line:90%
We've all done things.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
that you really feel

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:90%
like you need to talk about?

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:84%
We've become a very secular
nation or world, in general.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And through that, I think
we're spiritually starving.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that I think that
organized religion is the key

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to everything because
I personally don't.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:90%
But it was for a long time.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.154 align:middle line:84%
And when that was taken away,
with it went all of the ways

00:16:34.154 --> 00:16:35.404 align:middle line:90%
that we thought we did things.

00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The simple comforts
that people relied on.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Like having the
priest come in, and if there's

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:90%
anything last you need to say.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, people can't talk
about it with their own loved

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
ones because it's something that
they don't want them to know

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
or that they feel is
too big of a burden.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:10%
And so, that's where things like
hospice nurses are wonderful,

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:10%
death doulas are
wonderful, people

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.121 align:middle line:10%
who work in that industry
that a lot of their job

00:17:09.121 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:10%
is to talk about the
uncomfortable things

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.539 align:middle line:10%
that maybe family members aren't
comfortable talking about.

00:17:13.539 --> 00:17:14.339 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And most doulas, I
assume, are very well

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
versed in how to have that
kind of amenable grace-filled

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
educational programs.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
The Champlain
College in Vermont,

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:84%
actually, had a death doula
program for many years.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of my friends
Anne-Marie Keppel, who

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.927 align:middle line:84%
runs Stardust Meadows, she is a
death doula who teaches courses

00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:90%
throughout the year.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And she always brings
me in at the end

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
of her course, which I
think is really important is

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that, after these
people have trained,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
the last meeting that they
have, they're actually talking

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:84%
to a medium, who's talking about
death from the side of spirit

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:84%
instead of just
from the side of,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be working
with the person as they die.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful-- I would
think a beautiful profession

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:84%
for people who are
natural empaths.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is it an
actual profession now,

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.153 align:middle line:84%
or is it more just the
service that's more voluntary?

00:18:14.153 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Some people are
doing it professionally.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who
are doing it are

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:84%
mixing it with other
healing modalities

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
that they do because
it's still fairly new,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and people don't always
understand what it is.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
people, who I've met,

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:84%
who've been in the training,
or people who have worked as

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:90%
healers in different ways.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Or they're people who have
gone through a profound death

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.790 align:middle line:84%
with a family member and want to
educate themselves because they

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:90%
experienced that awe of death.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
a beauty in death

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
always understand.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But there really is
a beauty in death.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I would
guess that most hospice

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:84%
workers are already fulfilling
a lot of the doula's roles.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean, in
that sense, if you choose--

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know a lot about
the hospice profession,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:84%
but I assume it's like
any other profession.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:84%
You switch from an intensive
nursing care situation

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
to a gentler caregiver,
who's a hospice caregiver.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And hospice is usually a program
that is run that allows--

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.150 align:middle line:84%
it's when a person has reached
a point where they are not

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.460 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to get
treatment to get better,

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:90%
and they're actively dying.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And they can be in that, with
hospice for quite some time,

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's somebody who's coming
in for pain, pain mitigation.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And often, those
people are also--

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:84%
interestingly, a lot of
labor and delivery nurses

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:44.888 align:middle line:90%
become hospice workers.

00:19:44.888 --> 00:19:46.347 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
not be surprised.

00:19:46.347 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:90%
The beginning and the end.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Exactly.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exalt the spirit.

00:19:49.915 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:90%
That's really beautiful.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things we
touched on a little bit ago

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and I want to go
back to is the notion

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:84%
of so many people
dying so quickly.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So now, you, as a
medium, how will you

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
experience the
portion of it that

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
really has to do with
young people, who

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
can't hang on any longer, feel
they can't hang on any longer?

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So I refer to it
as people who are

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
partially responsible
for their own passing.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me,
includes suicide,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:84%
overdose, somebody
who has cirrhosis

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.730 align:middle line:84%
of the liver because they
drank themselves to death

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
is also going to fall
into that category.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But young people,
there really has been--

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
particularly in
the last six years,

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I have seen a huge
uptick in people

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:84%
who are coming to me
because they lost somebody

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:90%
to suicide or to overdose.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it, I think,
stems from mental illness,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:84%
We have a big stigma
around mental illness.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So when people do
have problems, they

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to
get help, or they

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
feel that there's going to
be judgment against them

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:90%
because they've sought help.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are really overloaded
by this newly sensitive

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.470 align:middle line:84%
or enhanced sensitive input that
they're getting intuitively.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So people who never had any
interest in being psychic

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
are finding themselves picking
up on other people's emotions.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're not living in
a home that has heavy emotions,

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
just watching
television or looking

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
at what the future holds
is overwhelming enough

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
people are checking out.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's really an interesting
confluence, frequency-wise,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:90%
of events.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you're here, you have
an earth that is transitioning,

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't happen as
quickly as we're led to believe.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:84%
It's transitioning into a higher
subdomain or frequency range

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:90%
or dimension.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:90%
And we all know this is true.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And it has been prophesied
throughout the ages

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that we are in a time
now where the Earth is

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
lifting her frequencies
into the next range.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can survive.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.460 align:middle line:84%
On any planet or in
any realm anywhere,

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:90%
if it's not a vibrational match.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So if we're living in one field,
and that's what we're used to,

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth is making
her transition upward,

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
which is also
creating instability,

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
uncertainty,
feelings of, like you

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.580 align:middle line:84%
said, being exposed and raw
because, suddenly, you're

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:90%
so sensitive to everything.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So on one level, we chose
to incarnate at this time

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and be part of this
grand transition.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.222 align:middle line:84%
But when you have to roll
your sleeves up, it's hard.

00:22:47.222 --> 00:22:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: It is hard.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so a lot
of people are really

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
struggling with that
feeling naked part of it

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.693 align:middle line:84%
now in these
lifting frequencies.

00:22:54.693 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:10%
>>SALICROW: There's
other things you can

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:10%
add to that are aggravating it.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:05.415 align:middle line:10%
One is I do think that
social media plays a part--

00:23:05.415 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, hugely.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: --in not being
able to get away from your pain

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I also feel like one
of the things that's

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
really important to think
about is that, there

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:90%
is a feeling of being lost.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.172 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And
again, that goes back

00:23:22.172 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:90%
to the spiritual starvation.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And so,
it's easier for somebody

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:84%
who's on a spiritual path to
be opening up empathically

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:84%
because they have guideposts
along the way that

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:84%
help them to understand
what's happening to them.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that I
really tried to do in the book,

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:10%
"Spirit Speaker,"
was show people

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:10%
what death could be like, or
what death, generally, is like,

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:10%
and what the afterworld is like.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And with people who
have lost people

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
due to their own responsibility,
one of the things

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I tell them is that, we
have to look at our emotions

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to that.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're in a time
where I describe

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:84%
emotions on a volume dial,
like listening to the radio.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And most people are going
through life, on a 0 to 10

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
volume dial, with their emotions
at about a three or four.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
A person who's struggling
with anxiety or depression

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:90%
has theirs at about a nine, OK?

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.300 align:middle line:84%
That means that
they are literally

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.083 align:middle line:90%
drowning in their emotions.

00:24:26.083 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Because if we had to walk
around with our stereo that loud

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.690 align:middle line:84%
all the time, we
wouldn't sleep right.

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be able
to concentrate right.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be able
to go about our life.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.060 align:middle line:84%
We'd always be distracted
and uncomfortable.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, part of
what needs to happen

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.960 align:middle line:84%
is, people have to start to
understand that they are highly

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:84%
sensitive beings, not just those
of us who are choosing to be,

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.855 align:middle line:84%
but human beings are
highly sensitive beings.

00:24:51.855 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Highly sensitive.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And everything around
us is encouraging

00:24:54.750 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
us to freak out and be in fear,
and that's the media for you.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they make
their money that way.

00:25:02.775 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Fear is addictive.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:90%
I was a news anchor.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.118 align:middle line:84%
I used to feed bad news
up to people, and I quit.

00:25:07.118 --> 00:25:08.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to do it anymore.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.452 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Good for you.

00:25:09.452 --> 00:25:12.737 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
people don't understand--

00:25:12.737 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go back
to adrenaline because I'm

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.090 align:middle line:90%
a canary in the coal mine.

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I have a very, very
rare condition.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of adrenal
insufficiency, where I don't

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:90%
create it to respond to stress.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:90%
So you can imagine how you live.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I've been in ERs
all over the world.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what happens
is, the thing that will--

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:84%
my body can start
going into a crisis.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I can actually change
the outcome, depending

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:90%
on the level of fear I go into.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Because fear itself requires so
much life force and adrenaline

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.410 align:middle line:90%
to process.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk
about people who

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:84%
are in constant states of
fear, normally, they're

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:84%
completely wrung
out and depleted,

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and it even becomes physical,
where you can't feel yourself

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.870 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Even if they don't
die from it, you

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:84%
feel like you might
as well be dead.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing left of you
by processing so much-- trying

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:90%
to process so much emotion.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So we have a big
problem on this planet,

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and this is what other
beings from other planets

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:84%
talk to us about is our emotions
and non-mastery of them.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.537 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that happens when we die

00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
is our emotions get turned
down to being about a two.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So on that same volume dial,
we can now spend a lot of our--

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
especially when we
first cross over,

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:84%
we are looking and
reviewing our life,

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
but the volume dial
has been turned down.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can have an
analytical perspective

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:84%
of these things that we
found overwhelming in life.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And that helps us to be
able to truly see and learn

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:90%
the lessons.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.805 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
always try to tell

00:26:47.805 --> 00:26:49.680 align:middle line:84%
people is that, even
though your emotions get

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.860 align:middle line:90%
turned down after you die,

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to make it really
clear because I've

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:84%
been interviewed a lot about
the topic of suicide lately.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's not an answer.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't get-- you don't go
to hell, like the church made

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:90%
people believe for years.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:84%
But what does happen
is that people

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:90%
you love experience hell.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And another medium
I interviewed,

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Sherrie Dillard said--

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and also Maureen
Hancock, all of you.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.120 align:middle line:84%
They have said that one of
the most common things that

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.357 align:middle line:84%
comes up is once
the person pops out

00:27:26.357 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:84%
of the body is, shoot, if I
could just tallk to someone.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I've experienced this a lot.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.475 align:middle line:84%
When you talked
about this uptick,

00:27:34.475 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:84%
one of the interesting
things that I've

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.910 align:middle line:84%
had with suicide and
overdose and clients related

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:84%
to that recently
is how many of them

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:46.180 align:middle line:84%
tell me that their actual
act of suicide was impulsive,

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and that they hadn't
been sleeping for days.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.395 align:middle line:90%
That will kill you.

00:27:50.395 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: If you've
worked in mental health

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:84%
at all, which I have, when
we don't sleep for days,

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
our brain begins to
kindle, which means

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:90%
that it's short-circuiting.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.545 align:middle line:90%
It's destroying brain matter.

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And so, a lot
of them, what you're saying

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.298 align:middle line:84%
is, once they're out,
they're like, oh, my God,

00:28:05.298 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I just did this
because it was an impulsive

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:90%
act.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.303 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And one of the other
problems that I want to bring

00:28:13.303 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
up with that is that people who
are on medication for mental

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:84%
health issues, a lot of doctors
and therapists that are working

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.170 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
people are being
treated with medication

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.160 align:middle line:84%
without there being enough
doctors to really review this.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And so, a lot of
that is also brought

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:84%
on by medication that wasn't
working right for people

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.922 align:middle line:84%
because they weren't
being moderated.

00:28:37.922 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is irreversible.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.682 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I
think it's so important

00:28:41.682 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
to understand not
to condemn or make

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
anyone feel guilty
over taking that path

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's out of
desperation in the moment.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
They didn't feel there
was anything else.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's so important
for all of us to know,

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
if we know anyone who's
suicidal or appears

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:84%
they could tip that way, that
every single incarnation is

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:06.170 align:middle line:84%
absolutely unique and
precious in its opportunities

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.110 align:middle line:84%
of what we can learn
and experience,

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.550 align:middle line:90%
and it will never come again.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.175 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we'll come around
again and again.

00:29:12.175 --> 00:29:13.842 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: We'll
probably have to learn

00:29:13.842 --> 00:29:15.380 align:middle line:90%
a lot of those lessons, too.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
we didn't, but you

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:84%
may not have the same cast
of characters around you

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that were to help you learn
them in a certain way.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
All of these things change
with each incarnation,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:90%
and we have to make--

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:84%
hang in there, and make the
best of it as best we can.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It's really important.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I think it's
important to connect

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.230 align:middle line:84%
with or try to find
community that you can trust.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people who
are struggling, particularly

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.030 align:middle line:84%
with addiction, there's a lot
of feelings of loneliness.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's like, seems to
be-- and again, I'll go back

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:90%
to social media on that.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that social
media makes us

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:84%
have thousands and thousands
of friends, but none.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: None.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:90%
They're not friends.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: No.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one of the things
you just talked about, I went--

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:84%
because this is all
very recent for me.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.950 align:middle line:90%
It's only been days.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of it, I was invited

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.443 align:middle line:90%
to the Ananda community.

00:30:10.443 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, maybe
that would be good.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:90%
The flowers are in bloom.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the
temples and meditated.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:90%


00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:16.760 align:middle line:90%
Dad

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and everyone was right
there, as soon as I sat down.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But going into places
like this, that

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:28.220 align:middle line:84%
have such high frequencies,
such peace and calm imprinted,

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I think is incredibly
important for all of us,

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.300 align:middle line:84%
alive, young, old,
healthy, dying,

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to go into these
places of peace where

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.610 align:middle line:84%
we can start
calming our emotions

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and feeling ourselves again
and develop a home away

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
from home, a refuge
of sorts, that we can

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.140 align:middle line:90%
return to whenever we want to.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't afford to
go to a center for that,

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.328 align:middle line:84%
make that a spot in the
forest, at a park, or any

00:30:53.328 --> 00:30:54.620 align:middle line:90%
place that you just find peace.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these places
are usually free anyway.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.470 align:middle line:90%
You can just walk in.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, to a
place in the forest.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Because trees are magnificent
in helping us process.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I also think it's helpful
to create a family shrine

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
or altar to your beloved
dead because that

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:84%
is a daily reminder
that you're not alone,

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.720 align:middle line:84%
that your loved ones
are there for you.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
could come enjoy.

00:31:19.105 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Exactly.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:20.983 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:31:20.983 --> 00:31:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things that happens is,

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:90%
you're dead for a little while.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.390 align:middle line:90%
You're gone.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.558 align:middle line:84%
You're in the other
domain, resting up a bit,

00:31:26.558 --> 00:31:29.100 align:middle line:84%
learning a few things, rolling
your sleeves up, and preparing

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.300 align:middle line:90%
for the next round.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And once that happens,
the being is not

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.295 align:middle line:84%
as available to you as a
spirit companion or guide

00:31:38.295 --> 00:31:40.170 align:middle line:84%
because they're going
into a new incarnation.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that transition.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Because often, people's
guides are family members.

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So most families
have, or I would say,

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.670 align:middle line:84%
all that I've met with
and what I've understood

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:84%
have a person who plays the
role of either the matriarch

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:02.130 align:middle line:84%
or patriarch in spirit, and
that spirit will generally

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:middle line:84%
be there until another family
member who has that ability

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.993 align:middle line:90%
crosses in to take that role.

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:10.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why, a lot
of times, people

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.900 align:middle line:84%
might be greeted by their
husband or their wife

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.810 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, but there's
usually some mother, or father,

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:84%
or grandmother,
who's also there,

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and that's because that
spirit has taken on that role.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And that means that somebody
comes for all of us.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Even if we are lost
ourselves, and we

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.170 align:middle line:84%
feel like we're isolated
in this physical world,

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we didn't
know our grandparents

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:84%
or maybe we didn't know this,
but somebody shows up for us.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:39.860 align:middle line:84%
There is somebody
who comes to get us.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.570 align:middle line:90%
So spirit, often, will--

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.240 align:middle line:84%
yes, people reincarnate, but
they have a tendency to pool

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.900 align:middle line:84%
together until
like enough of them

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:84%
are there to decide
it's time to incarnate.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we do like to play
in our spirit families.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.565 align:middle line:90%
We do like to come back in.

00:32:59.565 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.170 align:middle line:84%
There is a type of
ancestral DNA pattern

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that we continue to incarnate
into generally speaking.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Yes,
we don't always--

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.035 align:middle line:84%
And also, I think that it's
important to understand

00:33:10.035 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that it's not necessarily
DNA, that it's

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.460 align:middle line:90%
more of a soul family.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So when we think
about soul mates,

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
it's that there's
a team of people

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.480 align:middle line:90%
who like to play together.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think
of it more like,

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:90%
in the Celtic lands, the clans.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Your clan, you weren't
related to everybody by blood,

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.910 align:middle line:84%
but there was something
that held you together.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is, when we call
on the spirits to come to us--

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.430 align:middle line:84%
this I found fascinating
in your book--

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:44.650 align:middle line:84%
it's not easy for them to
manage an image for you

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.870 align:middle line:90%
to look at, a voice to hear.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the energy it takes

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:90%
and how mediums play a role.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Sure.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So in order for
spirit to communicate,

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:57.610 align:middle line:90%
they need an energy source.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And the two most common
are energetic ley lines.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why we experience
more spirit activity

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:84%
in certain places
because those places,

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.195 align:middle line:84%
if you were to bring a
dowser in or a geomancer

00:34:10.195 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
and would find have a high
energy vortex somewhere.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.409 align:middle line:90%
The other is through a medium.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:22.929 align:middle line:84%
And a medium is a person who
is a conduit or sensitive,

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit is able
to use their energy.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Spirit can communicate
with or can come to anyone

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:30.550 align:middle line:90%
that they love.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I describe it through
light and like a candle.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Most people are like
a tealight candle,

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and that light in the darkness
allows their loved ones

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:90%
to find them.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.885 align:middle line:84%
A medium is more like a
torch, or a developed medium

00:34:43.885 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:84%
might be like a
lighthouse, where

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:84%
there's a much
bigger luminosity,

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.929 align:middle line:90%
easier to communicate.

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:55.423 align:middle line:84%
So spirit, also, they don't all
have the same ability either.

00:34:55.423 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and that's
what I found interesting.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that for a moment.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Sure.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
can come in awkward ways

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:01.940 align:middle line:90%
if they're unskilled.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And when we die, we don't
lose our personality.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:90%
So if you were--

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And oftentimes,
we're not even really clear

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you were a
person who was not

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
very good at
communicating in life,

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:84%
you might struggle with
communicating in death.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I find that in my years
of being a medium,

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that I figured out that
introverts and extroverts

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.740 align:middle line:90%
communicate differently.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So extroverts are the
ones that come in,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:90%
most often, with a dialogue.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.020 align:middle line:84%
They're like chatty Cathys
that are talking to you.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Where

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.090 align:middle line:84%
introverted souls have
more of a tendency

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:42.350 align:middle line:84%
to show images and
fill you with emotions.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And it actually taught me a lot
about working with the living,

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.790 align:middle line:84%
was understanding that if
you have a partner who,

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:84%
every time you bring
something important up to talk

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:56.000 align:middle line:84%
to them about, they give you
an answer like, I don't know.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:57.920 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter to me.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or they're
stumbling for words.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.350 align:middle line:84%
They literally are
stumbling for words.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:84%
If instead you say,
hey, why don't you

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.700 align:middle line:90%
think about this and we'll talk?

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.408 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
a much better answer.

00:36:06.408 --> 00:36:08.300 align:middle line:84%
They just don't have
the words to go along

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.313 align:middle line:90%
with those images and emotions.

00:36:10.313 --> 00:36:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's introverts.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And extroverts--
I'm an extrovert.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I can talk about
anything at any time.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So an extroverted
spirit is most likely

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:84%
going to be a better
communicator for most mediums,

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:28.110 align:middle line:84%
just because they are
skilled at communicating.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:28.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots
of different ways

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.750 align:middle line:84%
in which spirits
communicate, and they all

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.520 align:middle line:90%
have to figure that out.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.140 align:middle line:84%
As far as I know,
there's no book

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.060 align:middle line:84%
they get when they
cross over that says--

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They just have
to find their way there.

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:40.337 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:36:40.337 --> 00:36:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And they might try things.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:84%
My dad, because we talked
about this earlier,

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that my sister was working
with him around his passing,

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.780 align:middle line:84%
my dad also had
psychic abilities.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.150 align:middle line:84%
But he never worked
with his because he

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:54.140 align:middle line:90%
had a really hard life.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.160 align:middle line:90%
He was a Vietnam vet.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:84%
He had a lot of reasons
he didn't want to.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.975 align:middle line:84%
But he did start opening up
to spirit, working with me.

00:37:03.975 --> 00:37:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: It was.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:84%
When he died, I mean,
my dad moved my car keys

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.830 align:middle line:90%
across the table.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.310 align:middle line:84%
He turned people's
windshield wipers on.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.670 align:middle line:84%
People would see he's still
an amazingly active spirit,

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's because he was
training for the last year

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and a half of his life
on-- because he also

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:22.950 align:middle line:90%
was a communicator.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:26.640 align:middle line:84%
So he was like, I'm going
to be able to communicate.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.253 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we only
have a few minutes left,

00:37:29.253 --> 00:37:30.420 align:middle line:90%
and I want to get into this.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people are afraid because
of some of, maybe, the things

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.570 align:middle line:84%
they've experienced
in life or done,

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to be
met with evil entities.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what your experience is

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:90%
in truth with that.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I have never met
anybody who's been to hell.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I've never really-- I have
experienced evil entities,

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.400 align:middle line:84%
but not in everyday
spirit communication.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:84%
That's usually a
much different story.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But people, in general, have
spirits that look out for them.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.262 align:middle line:84%
And when we cross,
we're not met by evil.

00:38:01.262 --> 00:38:02.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're protected.

00:38:02.345 --> 00:38:03.512 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: We're protected.

00:38:03.512 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:84%
If we have a lot of
garbage around our life

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.380 align:middle line:84%
at the end of our passing,
things that we didn't process,

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.400 align:middle line:84%
we're going to spend more time
in reflection than somebody who

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.500 align:middle line:90%
maybe worked on that in life.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But as a general rule,
I tell people, again,

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:26.360 align:middle line:84%
it goes back to the media about
exaggerating negative entities.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.260 align:middle line:90%
They are there.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's also negative
people around the world,

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.743 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot
more good people.

00:38:31.743 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Turn on the TV,
you're being bathed in negative.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Exactly.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.332 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one more thing that
probably feeds in with that,

00:38:37.332 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
notion of a timeout

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:39.860 align:middle line:84%
that you talk
about in your book.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So timeout is when people
have taken their own life,

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:84%
when they've passed
through suicide,

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.147 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes when
people have passed

00:38:51.147 --> 00:38:53.480 align:middle line:84%
at the hands of other people
because they're overwhelmed

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.560 align:middle line:84%
by their experience, or if
they've done a lot of really

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:90%
bad things in their life.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:01.700 align:middle line:84%
They're going to go into
what I call timeout,

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's like sending a kid
to the timeout chair when they

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:84%
have to reflect on their actions
and see what brought it about,

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:84%
what went wrong, how people
really feel about them.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So even when somebody
has had a lot

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.480 align:middle line:84%
of things to be
regretful of in passing,

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:90%
they're not being tortured.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.277 align:middle line:84%
They're being put
into this place, where

00:39:21.277 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:90%
their emotions are turned down.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.120 align:middle line:84%
They're reviewing their life,
not only from their angle,

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.160 align:middle line:90%
but other people's angles.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting to see
where things went wrong.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.990 align:middle line:90%
And they're healing.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And we can still-- this
is one of the reasons,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.390 align:middle line:84%
again, why ancestor altars
are helpful is, we can still

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.460 align:middle line:84%
contribute to our
loved one's healing,

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:84%
even after they have
passed, by healing ourselves

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and also by sending them
prayers, and love, and Reiki,

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:51.150 align:middle line:84%
or setting up an altar
and giving them offerings,

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and making sure they
know that you love them,

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.110 align:middle line:84%
you forgive them, that you're
still praying for them.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And final question.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you see a time coming, like
an almost utopian, Elysian

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Fields view of life,
where we choose our time--

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and there's a beautiful,
beautiful story

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.750 align:middle line:84%
of this in some of
Gates McKibben's works,

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.700 align:middle line:84%
where she talks about
these characters

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.040 align:middle line:84%
through three books,
called Grace and Luke that

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.800 align:middle line:84%
keep incarnating together,
but very consciously.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And that at the end of their
life, they go off in the field

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.310 align:middle line:84%
together when they're
old and they're done.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:28.110 align:middle line:90%
And they choose--

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I've met people who
can do that, who've done that,

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:30.770 align:middle line:90%
who really--

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about
that beautiful thing

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:33.810 align:middle line:90%
before we say goodbye.

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So I've met people,
who, well, have

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.650 align:middle line:84%
made the conscious decision
to let themselves go.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.020 align:middle line:84%
They were usually
were sick, so it's not

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.990 align:middle line:84%
like they were in perfect
health and decided that was it.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But they were usually
pretty spiritual people.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.473 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's an easily
achieved thing for people

00:40:52.473 --> 00:40:54.390 align:middle line:84%
because I think fear is
one of the things that

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.250 align:middle line:90%
gets in the way.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But my grandmother was
an example of that.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.710 align:middle line:84%
She was going to be
moved into a nursing home

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.293 align:middle line:84%
because she had this infection
in her foot that couldn't heal,

00:41:05.293 --> 00:41:06.585 align:middle line:90%
and she was just getting older.

00:41:06.585 --> 00:41:07.690 align:middle line:90%
She was 84.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And she had always said
that she would never

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.880 align:middle line:84%
go to a nursing home,
and she literally

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.970 align:middle line:84%
died the night before she was
going to go to a nursing home.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:84%
My mother died
suddenly, and she said,

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I would rather be dead than
see that man in office.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And she did not want to see
Bill Clinton take office

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and died 15 minutes
before midnight

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.110 align:middle line:84%
of an unexpected stroke
before his inauguration.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Because
it was something

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.278 align:middle line:84%
that she had made
a decision about.

00:41:32.278 --> 00:41:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think even my father.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Because just the
day before things

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.405 align:middle line:84%
went south really
quickly, there was

00:41:38.405 --> 00:41:40.780 align:middle line:84%
starting to look like there
was some dementia setting in,

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and he did not want to
live without his mind.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:46.660 align:middle line:84%
The next day, he's in the
ER, unconscious, and gone.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think they were
both conscious in that way,

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:50.780 align:middle line:90%
which is really beautiful.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: It is beautiful.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't want to
see someone lingering in a life

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.770 align:middle line:90%
they don't want out of fear.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's a note for all of us.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Do the very best we can, getting
through and managing emotions,

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:84%
find a good practice, find
people that we can talk to.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:05.400 align:middle line:90%
What else would you add to that?

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I would recommend
that people talk to their dead.

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:12.510 align:middle line:10%
Because our dead can hear
us, see us, experience.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.490 align:middle line:10%
I describe it like
a police mirror.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.850 align:middle line:84%
The dead are on the side,
that they can hear us, see us.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.460 align:middle line:84%
They have a hard time getting
us to hear or see them.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And the mediums,
the person who can

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.725 align:middle line:84%
walk between the
rooms going, hey,

00:42:23.725 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:84%
this is what they're
saying over there.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Final thought?

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.900 align:middle line:10%
>>SALICROW: My final
thought is that we

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.040 align:middle line:10%
need to prepare
ourselves for death,

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.550 align:middle line:10%
and we need to become
comfortable with it

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:10%
and educate ourselves
about it because it's

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:10%
going to happen to us all.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for such a
beautiful and intimate glimpse

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.313 align:middle line:84%
into something that
awaits all of us.

00:42:46.313 --> 00:42:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Thank you.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.298 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:42:48.298 --> 00:42:49.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again,
the name of the book

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.930 align:middle line:10%
is "Spirit Speaker: A Medium's
Guide to Death & Dying."

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:56.150 align:middle line:10%
