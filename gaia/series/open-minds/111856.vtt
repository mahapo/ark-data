00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Have you ever wondered

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.940 align:middle line:10%
why so many people in
the New Age movement

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.395 align:middle line:10%
have had a rough time
dealing with life, finances,

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:10%
and the like?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's because we've been
misinformed and even distracted

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
by promises of prosperity,
without encouraging

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:84%
our deep development
as the underpinnings

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:90%
to a life well-lived.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
To understand the lineage of
so much conflicting information

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:84%
in the self-actualization
movement,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
it's a delight for me to have
our guest today, Nigel Taylor,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:90%
with us once again.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.572 align:middle line:84%
We had a fabulous
conversation a couple of weeks

00:00:57.572 --> 00:00:58.530 align:middle line:90%
ago leading up to this.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.571 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go a
different direction with you,

00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:84%
but it was so interesting,
this is where we are.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.822 align:middle line:84%
And we had so much
fun last time.

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NIGEL TAYLOR: Yes we did,
and it's a pleasure to be back.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's start.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:84%
You said, just a moment ago,
before the camera came on,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
that you were giving
more thought to where

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:84%
this whole lineage that
became known as the "New Age"

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.290 align:middle line:90%
movement began.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, if you look at
what the New Age per se means,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.650 align:middle line:84%
it is the dawning of
this new consciousness.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And the dawning of
a new consciousness,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
if we actually track back,
has got different plateaus

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
upon which it has
reached its position.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:10%
One of the primary elements
which brought it forward

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:10%
was the time of
the Rosicrucians.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's going back to 1612,
1616, when the Rosicrucian

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:10%
manifesto came out.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:10%
And it was very secretive.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And the whole principle
behind that manifesto

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:84%
was that at times of
great persecution,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
there would be a way to
communicate hidden truths.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And those truths
permeated their way

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
through in the Age of Reason
and the Age of Enlightenment,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:84%
because it was shortly after
that that we had Descartes.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And then from Descartes
came a significant issue

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
of dualism, which he
never really intended

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:90%
to come out of his teachings.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Because in his
second meditation,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:84%
he alluded to the fact that in
actual fact, there is only one,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.484 align:middle line:84%
and this is an illusion
in which we are dancing.

00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, that's
not the part we're told.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, well, this
is-- but see, what happens,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.856 align:middle line:90%
and it's the same old story.

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Where did the Age
of Reason come from?

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It came from the failings of the
institutions that preceded it,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:84%
which controlled the
mystical elements of life.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And so the
Rosicrucians said, OK.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.722 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's see if we can
bring this back and make it--

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:49.555 align:middle line:90%
it's still mystical.

00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we can
reintroduce it to those

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:90%
who are willing to do the work.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And so doing the work
is the primary issue.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And out of that
movement there have

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
been many, many developments
from the 1600s, 1700s, 1800s.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
You bring yourself
right up to the--

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's say
to the 1920s and '30s.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well,
the 1920s and '30s,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.691 align:middle line:84%
you've got the
Theosophical movement.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: With the
Theosophical movement

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Anthroposophical
movement--

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, Steiner.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Those primary
movements and Steiner

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
were people who were actually
rational thinkers, in that they

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:90%
were scientifically based.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
That they were
looking at a pathway

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:90%
to refine consciousness.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
important element here.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The key is the
refining of the mind.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at
where we are today,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and this is a
generalization, because it's

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:84%
very unfair to take a brush
and sweep it across everybody.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.437 align:middle line:84%
But there's been a move
away from the refining

00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:55.145 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boy, has there been.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And see, if you
go through like you said,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
you have the mystery
schools, like BOTA.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Preceding that was
the Golden Dawn.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I think of
that the Rosicrucian doctrine

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
was loosely based on a lot of
the ancient, ancient hermetic

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:90%
doctrine.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It goes
back-- if you go back

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.494 align:middle line:84%
to the hermetic doctrine,
you can keep going.

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:90%
We can push this way back.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.704 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:90%
Back to Atlantis.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: And even beyond.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.004 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And beyond.

00:04:17.004 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So in this
current time frame

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking
at, what we've got

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
is the mystery schools,
which have grown out

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.320 align:middle line:90%
of the different traditions.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we come
to a place where

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:84%
we had the development
of teachers

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
that were very,
very well respected

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:90%
inside the American system.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Those were the likes of say,
US Anderson, Dale Carnegie.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:90%
This is how we think.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the power of
positive thinking.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Once the '60s came, there
was the Vietnam War.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:90%
There was the Age of Aquarius.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:90%
This is the time.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
change has come.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wanted to
change everything.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
That was the field
of information

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:90%
which was out there.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.698 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Leo generation.

00:05:00.698 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The Leo generation.
[CHUCKLES] Now, what happened--

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is, again,
an observation--

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
was the move was away from
personal responsibility

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
in your journey
of life to let me

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:84%
get an outcome with the easiest
possible path available.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So rather than
necessarily saying,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:90%
there's a law of attraction.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the law of
attraction-- which

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
became very big with "The
Secret," et cetera-- the law

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:90%
of attraction is, OK, fine.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
If I put this thought out,
I would attract to me,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:84%
and I will walk
into this reality.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But the very foundations of
what it was actually all about

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
was ripped away by the desire
and by the need, if you will,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
by some elements in
the community that

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:90%
wanted to teach this.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
To show people
you could actually

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:84%
create miracles
inside the dream.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But the real issue
is, if you create

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
an outcome inside this
dream which we live,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:90%
there are always consequences.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
There are always going
to be ramifications

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.927 align:middle line:84%
for the way in which
you use consciousness.

00:06:14.927 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And most of those miracles
that we were promised actually

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
did not manifest in
most people's lives.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, the proof is
in the pudding, as they say.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet, people would
still buy the books,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
go to the conferences,
spend millions of dollars,

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:90%
collectively.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, let me share
a lesson that I encountered

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:90%
very early in the piece.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Way back when I started
teaching these principles,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I had a gentleman
who went through.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had taught the very
foundations of consciousness,

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
as I understood it
at that time in which

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I taught it, which I'm happy
to say has considerably

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:84%
moved, and therefore,
has taught me a lesson.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But this gentleman
came in, and he

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
went through the whole
training and everything we did.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:90%
It went for five days.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty intense.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'm guessing it was
probably about six months,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:90%
a year later.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.990 align:middle line:84%
He turned up, and he
said, I've got this idea.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.602 align:middle line:90%
I thought, great.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Share it with me.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And he shared this
goal, if you will,

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that the largest piece of jade
which existed on the planet,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:84%
he was going to actually
convince the owner of this, who

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:84%
he didn't know and had
no direct connections to,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
to actually sell
it, and he would

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
make some huge sum of
commission on the sale of that.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, I
said, well, how exactly

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.911 align:middle line:90%
are you going to do that?

00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I'm visualizing.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm meditating.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm believing and I'm affirming.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:84%
You think it'll
happen, won't it?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.285 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I can't
say that that's

00:08:01.285 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:90%
the thing I would be doing.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I believe, and I'm

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:90%
going to make it happen.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Belief, desire, expectancy.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, I saw him, I guess, I'm
going to say a year later.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It might have been a
bit-- he lost everything.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:90%
He lost everything.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that
relative to myself.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
did I communicate

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
that would in any way
have led him to believe

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that all he needed to do
was go inside, visualize,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
imagine, project,
desire, believe,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.049 align:middle line:84%
and then bring this
reality to himself.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had to take stock of
my own part to play in this.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Because as a teacher-- and
this is the very essence--

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:84%
as a teacher, we are totally
responsible for everything

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:90%
we teach.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we do not accept
that responsibility,

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
my own personal
belief-- doesn't mean

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
to say it's true-- my
own personal belief is

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
we will pay a price in
our own soul's journey

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
for having misled people into
a place where they receive,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:84%
as a result of them placing
their power in our own hands,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle line:84%
which is what they
tend to do, that there

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:90%
is a price that will be paid.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, I looked at that,
and I learned a lesson.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.383 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was a blessing
to learn the lesson very early.

00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:84%
That the judgment
and guidance that

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
is given in any area
of consciousness

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
has to be from the authenticity
of your own experience.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where we go
back to the Rosicrucians.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And we go back to
the earlier teachers,

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and we go back to the
Egyptian traditions.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:90%
You go back to the Vedas.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
We must always be in that
authentic point of truth

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
in order to walk through the
door and say to somebody, let

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:90%
me tune in closely with you.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Let me become one with you,
so that when I say something

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:90%
to you, it is a truth.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Not just for me,
but it's because I

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
know exactly where you are
in your heart and your soul.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, story time.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.846 align:middle line:90%
I've got this thought going on.

00:10:05.846 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:90%
You've got to stop me.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:90%
You know I get carried away.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:07.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Tell the story.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Well, this goes back.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Neruda, who was one
of the great sages

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Brahmanic
tradition, Neruda's

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:84%
like this beautiful sage, and
he's in dialogue with the Lord.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord, by definition,
being the absolute principle.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
The Lord says to him,
Neruda, you've travelled all.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:90%
You've been everywhere.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.032 align:middle line:90%
You've seen all dimensions.

00:10:34.032 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You've seen every locale,
you've seen every universe.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:90%
You've seen everything.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So tell me, out of
everything you've seen,

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:90%
what's the greatest of all?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Is it the Earth?

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Is the water?

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Is it the fire?

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Is it the spirit?

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Air?

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.510 align:middle line:90%
He said, what is greatest?

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.625 align:middle line:84%
And Neruda says, this is
a question for the Lord,

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:90%
I better get this right.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:90%
So he thinks.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.223 align:middle line:84%
And he says, it's
got to be the Earth.

00:10:54.223 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And he says, because the Earth
is solid, and it's magnificent,

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and it's just got
so much substance.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:90%
And the Lord says, mm.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, but what
about the water?

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
He said, water covers
75% of the Earth.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.530 align:middle line:84%
He said, isn't that
something which

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:90%
would make it slightly better?

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:90%
He said, think about it.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.904 align:middle line:90%
And so Neruda goes, yeah, yeah.

00:11:16.904 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:90%
He said, you're right.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.346 align:middle line:90%
He said, I have to agree.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:84%
That which covers has
to be greater than that

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.472 align:middle line:90%
which is being covered.

00:11:22.472 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord says,
well, Neruda, he said,

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:90%
so let me ask you this.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, if that's
the case, he said,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
there was a sage that
came down to the Earth

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
when the demons hid in
the bottom of the ocean,

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many,
many moons ago.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he drank
all of the ocean.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.900 align:middle line:90%
The whole lot.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:90%
He said, so let me ask you this.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Who would be the best,
the most profound?

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Would it be the
ocean, or would it

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:84%
be the one that drinks of
the ocean, the whole lot?

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:90%
He says, no doubt.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's got to be the
one that drinks of the ocean.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And so he said,
well, the Lord says,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Neruda, let me just continue
this, if you don't mind.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, because
there was a point when

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.230 align:middle line:84%
that particular
sage took his leave,

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:90%
went back into the heavens.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:84%
He became a star, and
he filled with light.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And he says, but
he was, in the sky,

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.805 align:middle line:90%
at night time, just a tiny dot.

00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:90%
He said, so what's the biggest?

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:90%
What's the best?

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.971 align:middle line:90%
What's the most profound?

00:12:22.971 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it the sage, which is just
a tiny dot in the night sky,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
or is it the sky, which
involves everything?

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.797 align:middle line:84%
And so Neruda said, oh, he
said, Lord, you got me on this.

00:12:30.797 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:90%
He says, it's got to be the sky.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.335 align:middle line:90%
He said, very well Neruda.

00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:35.796 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case,
well, what about this?

00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when
the Lord actually

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:90%
reincarnated on the planet.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, came
down as a dwarf,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
on one foot, took over the
entire earth, water, fire,

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Covered the whole lot.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, so the
sky went with it.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:90%
So which is biggest?

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Which is best?

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Which is greatest?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.380 align:middle line:90%
He goes, all right.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:90%
Final, final answer.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, I know it's
going to be the Lord.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:84%
He said, the Lord has
to be the greatest.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that-- there's
no way out of this.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.740 align:middle line:84%
The Lord's the greatest, because
his infinite expense covers

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
The Lord looks at him and says,
but Neruda, one last question.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.280 align:middle line:90%
And he says, yes, my Lord.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, which
would be greatest?

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:84%
He said, would it be
the devotee of love that

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
holds the Lord locked,
imprisoned in his heart,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:84%
or would it be the Lord who's
in the heart, locked away,

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:90%
can't get out.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.875 align:middle line:90%
He said, you tell me.

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, then it has
to be the devotee.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And the point which
we make here is

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
that all of the mystery
traditions, every one of them,

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:90%
is about the heart.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the mind.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have a lot
to filter through then,

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
so people that are
watching this, many of whom

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:84%
have been on these paths a
long time, some who are new,

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.790 align:middle line:90%
can see themselves.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can see a
portrait of what

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:90%
we've been talked into a bit.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.095 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how else to put it.

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
But now, do you mind if we
go back in a linear-- use

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.660 align:middle line:84%
our minds and go
back in a linear way?

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.392 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
NLP in the '80s.

00:14:12.392 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
You brought that up when we
were talking on the phone

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:90%
a couple weeks ago.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did-- most people have
heard of NLP, Neuro Linguistic

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Programming.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:90%
How did that start all of this?

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.543 align:middle line:90%
What was its role to play?

00:14:23.543 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, my
understanding-- and this

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean to say it's
absolute-- my understanding is

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it came from the
work of Grinder and Bandler

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.076 align:middle line:90%
doing the research.

00:14:34.076 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of their
understandings

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:90%
came from Milton Erickson.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, Milton Erickson was one of
the truly great men and women

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
who were involved in the
research of human mind

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective of
hypnosis and getting people

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:84%
to assume a shifting
state of consciousness,

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
for purposes, primarily,
of helping that person.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Walk into a place where they
could leave behind phobias

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:90%
and any number of things.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, those two guys did an
enormous amount of work.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
They presented
phenomenal material,

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
which then literally became,
I believe, if I'm right,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:84%
it became very popular, not
only in their teachings,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
but also, I think Anthony
Robbins probably made it.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
He'd have a slightly
different turn to it.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But this, then,
everybody went out.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And every second program
was integrating NLP

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
as part of the overall training
for mind and for consciousness.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Is it wrong?

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:90%
The question becomes a game.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
What is the objective
of introducing language

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes of
accessing a change of state?

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it, and here's
the question, is it

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:84%
to help a person move into
a space of deeper truth,

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:84%
or is it to help them achieve
a goal for which they're not

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:84%
authentically aligned
in their own truth?

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is the hallmark
of a lot of New Age doctrines.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It has been.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.216 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It has been.

00:16:10.216 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is also used
to manipulate people.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go there.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Manipulation and we see it.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It's involved in political
speech all the time,

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of the mass
cultural hypnosis, which

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:84%
we spoke of last time
we were together.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But the potency and
the power of language,

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and the manner in which
it is used, is-- again,

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
a personal perception-- is
actually keeping people away

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:90%
from their heart.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Because getting into
that space of the heart

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:84%
is literally where
the entire structure,

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:84%
all the work on the
mystical tradition,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:90%
has its roots and origins.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Let me just give you-- if I
can give you an example, here.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:84%
The tradition of
Kabbalah or Kabbala--

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:84%
however people like
to pronounce it-- it's

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
been associated for
a long, long time

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
with the Jewish
mystical tradition.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
However, looking at the
principle of the word Kabbalah,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.890 align:middle line:90%
it means to receive.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.536 align:middle line:84%
It means to become open,
to become receptive to,

00:17:18.536 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:84%
to integrate and become aware
of that which who we are.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can only
receive in relationship

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:90%
to that which is projecting.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
If you look in the
Kabbalistic projections,

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
you will see that we have
this whole body of work where

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:84%
we speak of, in the
Western tradition, God,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.050 align:middle line:90%
in a masculine sense.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:90%
In a masculine sense.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons that comes out

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
is because God is
actually, by definition,

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
regardless of how we define
God, is the projecting force,

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and we, in our space,
are the receiving.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're the feminine,
and we're receiving

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.110 align:middle line:90%
this projective energy.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But then it's upon us
to become the living God

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and to project back.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So the whole concept
of understanding mind

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:84%
is to go into a space
where we can rationalize,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:84%
where we can refine, the way
in which we use our mind.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Cut away all the dross
and get to a space

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:84%
where words are meaningful,
processes are unlocking

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.790 align:middle line:84%
the heart, and where,
at the end of the day,

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that which is revealed is the
truth and the authenticity

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.247 align:middle line:84%
of who we are as a
being of pure love.

00:18:47.247 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an example
of what I mean by this.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:84%
In the blue book, in
"Power Before Thought,"

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I spoke about a term which,
if people work through those

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:84%
principles in the book, it is
to take them to a place which

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.774 align:middle line:84%
the Sanskrit tradition
calls bhava, B-H-A-V-A.

00:19:06.774 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And bhava is-- it's not
even unconditional love.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a love which is so
profound, so deep, so rich,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.795 align:middle line:84%
that if you try to express it,
you've lost it immediately.

00:19:20.795 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Let me talk about how
you recognize this.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.885 align:middle line:90%
Am I on target for where you--

00:19:26.885 --> 00:19:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:27.370 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll take you back this
other place in a bit.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But the
principle of bhava

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
is that you've done the
work through the refinement

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
of your mind by monitoring
your thoughts in such a way

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that you're heading
always into the heart.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.227 align:middle line:84%
Nothing but nothing but
nothing will ever stop you

00:19:49.227 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:90%
from getting to the heart.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way in which you'd
recognize a person who's

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:84%
reached that is that if
they're actually with somebody,

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
you will often sense, and you
will experience a rich taste

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:84%
in your mouth or a smell,
a fragrance of rose

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:90%
or gardenia or jasmine.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It is because they are
literally the nectar of love.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:84%
They have become
that nectar of love,

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and they've worked
so hard to refine

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:84%
their mind that they have
no attachments to anything.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:84%
They have no desire to
hold onto any belief.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
They will protect their
mind in no way whatsoever.

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
They work with the understanding
that everything is divine;

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:84%
the trees, the sun, the
moon, everything is divine.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, you come back to where
we started our conversation.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.982 align:middle line:84%
Our conversation is how did we
get into this New Age path--

00:20:53.982 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:84%
We have two parallel
conversations.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're going.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
where we've been.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:00.675 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:21:00.675 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:90%
So how did we get here?

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.729 align:middle line:90%
We cut ourselves off from love.

00:21:05.729 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:90%
And let's-- OK.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, can we go back
to that timeline

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:84%
of the ways in
which we did this?

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
The various ways in which the
movements we participated in,

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:84%
including yourself, did
this, so we can see, where

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:90%
did these little cuts happen?

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:10%
Another thing you were
talking about when

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:10%
we talked before was about the
self-actualization movement

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:10%
in the '90s really ended up
to be more about manipulation.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:10%
And when we look at where these
programs-- and I'm talking

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:10%
again in a broad sense--
the programs, very much,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:10%
are about personal power.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or personal gain.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Or personal gain.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
There was a point at
which people really

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:90%
moved away from that.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
When we were in the
'60s, they moved away.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to make
this the planet which

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
was one, which was joyful,
it was the Garden of Eden, et

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But the more we had a shift
into economic despair,

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
economic circumstances which
were tough or challenging,

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:84%
that's when people
found themselves

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:84%
going to these programs,
attending programs which

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:90%
were meant to be quick fixes.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.722 align:middle line:84%
Now, that meant you
could do self-hypnosis,

00:22:21.722 --> 00:22:23.930 align:middle line:84%
you could do affirmation,
you could do visualization,

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:90%
you could do all of this stuff.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:90%
You could do your NRP.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.110 align:middle line:84%
There were so many
of these programs--

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Often
for monetary gain,

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.710 align:middle line:90%
because people were frightened.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Exactly.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And people will give a lot
of money, a lot of money,

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:84%
in order to get
what they think will

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:84%
be the final outcome, which
will be they will satisfy

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.420 align:middle line:84%
their needs in such a way
that they'll be able to--

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and this is very sad--
but be able to manipulate

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
the outcomes in their
life by using their mind.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go further
down that rabbit hole.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Now, Queensland.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Queensland.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.723 align:middle line:84%
You said that's kind
of like the Bible Belt.

00:23:04.723 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about Queensland.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:90%
What was given birth to there?

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
ourself up through the time

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.595 align:middle line:90%
of the early 2000s.

00:23:11.595 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:84%
You can stop along
the '90s if you want.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And into "The Secret."

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, let's
think about some

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:84%
of the different pathways
that are involved here.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.810 align:middle line:84%
There are a few people that
have been what I would consider

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:90%
to be pioneers in the field.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of which was
going to '60s, '70s,

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
'80s, '90s, and then
on to 2000 plus.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.835 align:middle line:84%
Jose Silva-- and I knew
Jose Silva personally.

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Silva method.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.084 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: The Silva method.

00:23:42.084 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Jose was what I consider to
be a very straightforward,

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:90%
a simple man.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Not in a negative sense,
but a simple man in that he

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
saw what he was doing,
and he endeavored

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.720 align:middle line:90%
to help make the place better.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people-- his
objective was, what he said

00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:90%
was this.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:90%
This was way back in the '60s.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to make
everybody a Silva instructor.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, 7 billion or
6 billion people

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.420 align:middle line:84%
on the planet,
which means nobody

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:84%
needs to have anybody teach them
anything, because everybody is.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, from that,
many, many people

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
who are in the New Age movement
had their roots and origins.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:90%
They started there.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going
to start somewhere,

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.197 align:middle line:84%
you've got to break away
in order to be different.

00:24:26.197 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to
break away to be different,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.847 align:middle line:84%
you can't take the exact
program and copy it.

00:24:31.847 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:90%
So what happens is--

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:32.726 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:32.726 --> 00:24:33.809 align:middle line:90%
You take pieces out of it.

00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You take a piece
of this and a piece of that.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, you
get these break aways.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you go back
to the original scriptures.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:90%
The original scriptures.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Going back to say, Christ,
or going back to the Vedas,

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:84%
How many masters
have broken away

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.664 align:middle line:84%
along the path to get to
the point where you've got

00:24:54.664 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
denominations in Christianity,

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you just took, for
instance, Jose and what

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:84%
he gave, or you took the
works of Robert Monroe, who

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
was another-- what
I personally-- I

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.170 align:middle line:84%
found him to be one
of the people who

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:90%
was authentic and genuine.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to tell you why.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I sat with Robert Monroe back
in 1992, and he would have been,

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing about
79 at that point.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Close.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And he had this shine
and sparkle in his eyes

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
the moment anybody
shared anything,

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.720 align:middle line:84%
because he was learning every
single moment of his life.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And he had nothing
set rock standard.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
He wanted people
to grow and evolve.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But out of his movement came
all of the different folks

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:90%
who broke away.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, every time
there is a breakaway,

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
you've got to justify
your existence.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can justify
your existence

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.250 align:middle line:84%
if there is authenticity
in your soul

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and something is
burning through you

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:84%
that you need to present without
a desire for a huge amount

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:84%
of compensation and also
with the responsibility

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.620 align:middle line:84%
that whatever you
say to the person,

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:84%
you're going to wear
the consequences.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, that took a real dive.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Again, this is me personally.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:84%
That took a real dive
when we simplified things.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And we simplified
things in the '90s

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and into the 2000s, when we
took all of this material which

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.500 align:middle line:84%
had been available, a lot
of biblical, and a lot of it

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:90%
from way back.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And we said, guys,
there's an easy way.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:35.735 align:middle line:90%
It's all about attraction.

00:26:35.735 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we all liked
hearing that at the time.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's all about
the law of attraction.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, is there a
law of attraction?

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes there is.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know it.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:47.198 align:middle line:90%
We experience it.

00:26:47.198 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the only law.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:90%
And it is part of the journey.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But if we actually make
that the foundation stone,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.060 align:middle line:90%
we've got to build on that.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And if we haven't looked
underneath to see where

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:84%
it comes from, what
we're starting here,

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:84%
without our
foundation, to build,

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:84%
a series of principles
and techniques

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
which are only rotating
around this idea

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that put the thought out,
manifest and bring it back

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:90%
into your life.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.863 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
did that come to be?

00:27:16.863 --> 00:27:18.307 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
from your country.

00:27:18.307 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, "The Secret,"
to my knowledge,

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.350 align:middle line:84%
manifested itself
out of Queensland

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:84%
in the eastern
states of Australia.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Now, I love my country.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Australia's a beautiful country.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.302 align:middle line:84%
But Queensland has
a very strong area--

00:27:36.302 --> 00:27:37.760 align:middle line:84%
well actually, not
just Queensland.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
You come down the
South West coast.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:84%
There is a strong alternative
patch, if you will,

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.710 align:middle line:84%
of folks who are
prepared to explore,

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're prepared to
put themselves on the line.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But once something is seen--
I mean, many years ago, back

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:84%
in Australia, there
came from Queensland

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
a whole series of
movements across Australia,

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:84%
where different
classes would come

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.081 align:middle line:84%
in saying to West Australia
or South Australia.

00:28:06.081 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And what they would
be is they would

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.860 align:middle line:84%
be outgrowths of something
that had previously

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:90%
been taught by another person.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there's good marketing.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And good marketing
is literally, now,

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.509 align:middle line:84%
what a lot of the
New Agers are about.

00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And the principle
of the good marketing, it

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.990 align:middle line:84%
actually uses
manipulation to get

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
people to come on board,
to take a direction which

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
may not necessarily
be in their interest.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why was "The
Secret" such a phenomenal event

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:90%
at the time?

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.765 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Fear.

00:28:41.765 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fear.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.831 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Fear.

00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:90%
Again.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:90%
My perception.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a longing in people
to find their purpose.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:90%
To find their meaning.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.890 align:middle line:84%
To accomplish what they
came to this planet to do.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very genuine longing.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
When I say fear, it's like one
of the great mystical teachings

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:90%
says, death is initiation.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:90%
Initiation is death.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:84%
We have to walk
through our life,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and it is a pathway of
self transformation.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Self transformation comes
by confronting who we are.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:90%
What we are.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:84%
The fear of not
knowing who we are.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Having a meaningful existence.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Having a purposeful existence.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Reaching that point
where we realize

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that we've made a
difference on this planet.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:84%
As people move through life, in
the early years, in their 20s

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:90%
and maybe 30s, it's like, OK.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.270 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
change the world?

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's a mind
training program.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Let me do it.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:90%
And then they'll get results.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.470 align:middle line:90%
They'll get great results.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, as they get a little
bit older, they start to think,

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:84%
you know, but hey, I started
this 30, 40 years ago.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Mm, have I really
found out who I am?

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I know I can use my mind, and
I know I can bring results.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.695 align:middle line:84%
But does it always benefit
everybody in my life?

00:30:16.695 --> 00:30:19.752 align:middle line:84%
Have I, in my relationships,
been as positive

00:30:19.752 --> 00:30:20.960 align:middle line:90%
as I would have wanted to be?

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Why did these people
maybe move on?

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And so this self-assessment
is literally

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:90%
about self transformation.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And when people go
to the easy path,

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:84%
it is like we go back
to the Rosicrucianism,

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:90%
when we started there.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:90%
That was about the work.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The work of the
mystery schools and all

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.205 align:middle line:84%
the different traditions;
the Theosophists, of BOTA,

00:30:43.205 --> 00:30:43.830 align:middle line:90%
of Golden Door.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are years-long
training, life-long training.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.584 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Eventually,
the whole thing--

00:30:47.584 --> 00:30:50.870 align:middle line:84%
it's not a type of-- If you come
in, and you come into my class,

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I will convert your
life overnight.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is-- I
know that, because I

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.670 align:middle line:90%
confront that every day.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Because in the world in which I
live, world in which you live,

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.250 align:middle line:84%
we share the
commonality here, is

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:84%
you have to tell people,
these things you will

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.480 align:middle line:90%
get if you come into this room.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do I is I get caught.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very hard, because
I'm not prepared to say,

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
you come in here, and your world
is going to be so different.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:84%
What I am prepared to
say is, if you come in,

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.010 align:middle line:90%
we're going to do some work.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
explore some ideas.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
deep, interplaying work,

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and then, when you leave here,
your life will be different.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But I can't guarantee
when you leave here,

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.600 align:middle line:84%
your life is going
to be fantastic.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or better.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It may actually be a
lot worse because you met me.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I mean, I met
myself, and I-- but this

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:48.562 align:middle line:90%
is a possibility.

00:31:48.562 --> 00:31:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
the part of-- that's

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:90%
the point of deep exploration.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Which again, going back to the
phenomenon in the early 2000s,

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.969 align:middle line:84%
with "The Secret," there
wasn't any depth on--

00:31:59.969 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you actually look,
there is a whole movement now.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Regina-- my Regina.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.065 align:middle line:90%
My wife, Regina--

00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
your wife, Regina.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: My wife Regina--

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Two in the same room.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.918 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --made a comment
to me the other day,

00:32:13.918 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it
was very telling.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we've written
a few books at a time.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The first one was 650 pages, the
second one was about 650 pages.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.490 align:middle line:90%
The next one was 460 pages.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.749 align:middle line:84%
The last one was-- this
one was 170, and the 170--

00:32:28.749 --> 00:32:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This one's going
to be five. [CHUCKLES]

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.581 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Well, no.

00:32:31.581 --> 00:32:33.420 align:middle line:84%
What she said, she was
talking to someone,

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.350 align:middle line:90%
and she reflected back to me.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:84%
She said, have you
noticed how we've

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.740 align:middle line:90%
gone 640 all the way down?

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Then we came down to an
article of three pages.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Then we came down to a page.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.227 align:middle line:84%
Then we came down
to a paragraph.

00:32:46.227 --> 00:32:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Then we came down to a sentence.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we came down to
a few power words.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Then we came down to a key word.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Then we came down to a
hash tag and an emoticon.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:84%
She said, now, this is
how we are opening up

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.640 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.540 align:middle line:84%
She said, but what
level are we working at?

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:84%
She said, what level
are we working at

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.870 align:middle line:84%
to actually be working
with such very, very

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:90%
basic-- it's a new language.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a new language.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a new level
of consciousness,

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and it has skipped all
of the foundations.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:19.990 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All of the
foundations, yes.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:21.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So on that, one
of the modalities

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.150 align:middle line:84%
that has been used over
the last 20, 30 years,

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.400 align:middle line:84%
is the notion of-- and I'm going
to use this as an example--

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.940 align:middle line:90%
a vision board.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is really key in
"The Secret" and a lot

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.070 align:middle line:84%
of the different
courses and teachings,

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.614 align:middle line:90%
is you have your vision board.

00:33:39.614 --> 00:33:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
ways to go about that.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.095 align:middle line:84%
You choose your
images, your desires.

00:33:43.095 --> 00:33:44.470 align:middle line:84%
You put everything
on your board.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:10%
You look at it, and everything
happens, and you live in bliss.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's something
I did, I started

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.230 align:middle line:90%
doing maybe 25 years ago or so.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.355 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, this is fun.

00:33:56.355 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:90%
A vision board.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And I started watching what
happened through the years,

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:84%
because every New Year's,
I would have a vision board

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.200 align:middle line:90%
party.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So everybody would
bring their magazines,

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.228 align:middle line:84%
have a glass of
champagne, and we'd

00:34:07.228 --> 00:34:09.469 align:middle line:84%
start putting our
vision boards together.

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:11.020 align:middle line:84%
There were a couple
things about it,

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and I would like you
to key in on the "why"

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.340 align:middle line:90%
for behind what I'm saying.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:84%
One thing I would
have people say is,

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.050 align:middle line:90%
don't think about what you want.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:24.889 align:middle line:84%
Don't think about
your desires when

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.239 align:middle line:90%
you go through these images.

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Have a glass of champagne and
go lightly and quickly through.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.484 align:middle line:84%
And if your gut says
yes, just tear it.

00:34:33.484 --> 00:34:35.010 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
it is, if it's a word,

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:35.949 align:middle line:90%
or if it's an image.

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:90%
But just only listen to the gut.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Not the mind.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of it, you
end up with a portrait

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:90%
of your subconscious desire.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, when done that way, it was
pretty amazing how much of what

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:84%
was pinned onto that
board would occur in life.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.160 align:middle line:84%
When people were using
their minds to override it,

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I need more money, I want to
have a massive, big house,

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and they'd tear those
images out using their mind,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.360 align:middle line:84%
very little would
manifest on those boards.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about-- and
just using that as an example--

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.260 align:middle line:84%
the difference between listening
to a subconscious directive

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:20.550 align:middle line:84%
versus these desperate desires
or wants or what we think

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:21.350 align:middle line:90%
are needs.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that, as
you're answering that,

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.250 align:middle line:84%
tell us the story of the woman
who said she wanted $10 million

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.190 align:middle line:90%
in a couple months.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Because it gives you a lot to
work with there to explain why

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.730 align:middle line:84%
does one way of doing it
work and the other doesn't.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well
again, in a nutshell,

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:42.680 align:middle line:84%
it comes back to
authenticity of self.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It comes back to
understanding desire and what

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.690 align:middle line:84%
desires we hold, at what level
of our being we hold them,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:84%
why we are pursuing
them in the first place.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll give you a couple
of examples to try and put

00:35:58.530 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:90%
this in perspective.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:84%
My mother, and she's
passed, but bless her.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.999 align:middle line:84%
She actually had
a very good life,

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.290 align:middle line:90%
but she had a challenging life.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Because from a very,
very early age,

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.740 align:middle line:84%
she was literally
psychic in every way.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.170 align:middle line:84%
She saw, she knew,
she knew everything.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:84%
This resulted in
her having a series

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:27.060 align:middle line:84%
of breakdowns and electric shock
treatment and drug treatments.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I spent the better
part of my childhood

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.570 align:middle line:84%
going to institutions,
where I would see people

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:38.330 align:middle line:84%
having electric shock treatment
and having drug treatment.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I saw her many times
when I was a kid.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I would go every Friday
to these hospitals,

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:46.730 align:middle line:90%
where the-- what's the word?

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:47.515 align:middle line:90%
The patients.

00:36:47.515 --> 00:36:48.890 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
a better world.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But people who were
in there for reasons

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.180 align:middle line:84%
that weren't of
their own making,

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.630 align:middle line:84%
necessarily, would get together,
and they'd have a dance.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would dance
with these people.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's my mother,
lost, in a void,

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.500 align:middle line:84%
because she had
been reprogrammed

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.840 align:middle line:84%
by the use of drugs and
electroshock treatment.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason
I mention that is

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.010 align:middle line:84%
because she had a
very powerful mind,

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:17.552 align:middle line:90%
and she had a wonderful heart.

00:37:17.552 --> 00:37:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was,
she came from a base

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.610 align:middle line:84%
of fear, which is
why I mentioned fear

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:25.520 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:84%
She always had a fear
that she simply wouldn't

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.750 align:middle line:90%
have what was necessary.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And that went back to the
wartime, the childhood wartime

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and the loss of someone
she loved in the war.

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I step
forward in time,

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:84%
she ended up coming to one of
my programs in the early years.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So she's sitting
there, all proud,

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.320 align:middle line:90%
the way mothers do what they do.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And she suddenly
gets it in her mind

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.250 align:middle line:84%
that if I use what
he's saying, I might

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:90%
be able to get some results.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So she decides she's going
to work with her mind

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:01.770 align:middle line:90%
to bring about some results.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, she'd already proven that
she had a very powerful mind,

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:84%
because she took herself
down the path of great pain

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.602 align:middle line:90%
and suffering.

00:38:08.602 --> 00:38:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So one day, she
decides she's going

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.970 align:middle line:90%
to go in for a competition.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So she goes in for
this competition,

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's for a trip around
Australia on a cruise ship,

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.603 align:middle line:90%
and it's all expenses paid.

00:38:19.603 --> 00:38:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Done up.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.910 align:middle line:84%
She's in the shopping center,
this is going back to the time

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:25.160 align:middle line:84%
when you didn't have
the internet and that.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And she's right at the back.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And she's-- you've got
to be present to win.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So she's standing back, and
the guy's announcing it.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't hear anything.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So she's thinking, well, all
these people are missing out.

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't
hear, so they can't.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So she goes forward after
the second name's been drawn.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.010 align:middle line:90%
And she says, excuse me.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.270 align:middle line:84%
She said, dear, nobody
can hear what's going on.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:90%
He said, I apologize.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.495 align:middle line:84%
So as she turns around, he
goes, Mrs. Taylor of Willagee.

00:38:49.495 --> 00:38:51.599 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, oh, that's me.

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:52.390 align:middle line:90%
So she goes around.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.330 align:middle line:84%
She opens-- so she wins,
and she gets this trip.

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, wait for this.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.140 align:middle line:84%
She then proceeds to win,
because she won that one thing,

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:90%
she won the lottery.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Her name was called
out as the viewer

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:08.600 align:middle line:84%
on "The Wheel of Fortune,"
and she won $30,000 on that.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.630 align:middle line:90%
She won a caravan.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:10.960 align:middle line:90%
She won a trip to America.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.190 align:middle line:84%
She won-- and it went
from one to the other.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a sudden,
everything stopped.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.620 align:middle line:90%
And she went into a hole.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And what happened for
everything to come to a halt

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.470 align:middle line:90%
was my father got ill.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And when she thought she
was going to lose him,

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
every fear she had ever
had rose to the surface,

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and then everything she
had just left her, apart

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:44.250 align:middle line:84%
from her fear and her husband,
who was ailing at the time.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.586 align:middle line:90%
So she went through.

00:39:46.586 --> 00:39:47.960 align:middle line:84%
She did all the
different things.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.560 align:middle line:90%
She proved it could work.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But then, at the time
of the greatest need,

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.520 align:middle line:84%
the point where she was,
was the deepest issue,

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:59.120 align:middle line:84%
which was the fear of the
loss of love, rose up.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:90%
It canceled everything else out.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:03.010 align:middle line:84%
All the joy, all the
fear, of all the desires

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and all the attachments,
which she deserved.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.610 align:middle line:84%
They meant nothing, because
the one thing she really wanted

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.697 align:middle line:84%
was love, and she did
not want to lose it.

00:40:13.697 --> 00:40:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.946 align:middle line:84%
And that was the point
I was getting to,

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.600 align:middle line:90%
that authentic part of it.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Back with people putting
their images on their board.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:21.930 align:middle line:90%
There's I need this.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:22.650 align:middle line:90%
I need that.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:23.895 align:middle line:90%
Oh gosh, I need a new sink.

00:40:23.895 --> 00:40:24.395 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:24.395 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll put a sink on there.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:90%
No, need, need.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.750 align:middle line:90%
All that was fear driven.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:32.430 align:middle line:84%
These never-- and "The Secret"
didn't-- and just using "The

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:36.245 align:middle line:84%
Secret" again, it didn't
differentiate these mindsets.

00:40:36.245 --> 00:40:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.991 align:middle line:90%
Because it's the old story.

00:40:38.991 --> 00:40:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Be careful what you ask for,
because you're going to get it.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:44.234 align:middle line:84%
And what you tend
to get-- see, when

00:40:44.234 --> 00:40:46.900 align:middle line:84%
we were in our conversation, and
this is in context of where you

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:55.610 align:middle line:84%
are here, is that the principle
of working with consciousness

00:40:55.610 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:84%
is that we have moved from
a model of mechanistic,

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.450 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the
random god force, which

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:12.280 align:middle line:84%
has got no type of life in
it, into one of understanding

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.470 align:middle line:84%
the implicate order
which underlies

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:20.200 align:middle line:84%
all of the laws of
the entire cosmos.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.905 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I would
say to you is this--

00:41:22.905 --> 00:41:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Without
going all Bohm on us,

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:25.654 align:middle line:90%
just give us what you mean.

00:41:25.654 --> 00:41:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: What I
suggest to you is this.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Is that the whole of creation is
based upon a fabric of law that

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.620 align:middle line:84%
works fundamentally,
according to very, very, very

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.580 align:middle line:84%
deterministic,
deterministic principles.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.700 align:middle line:90%
We will not know the outcome.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But the outcome is
already determined,

00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:02.210 align:middle line:84%
because the
conditions of the law

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:08.670 align:middle line:84%
are such that they will always
respond in infinite ways

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:12.380 align:middle line:84%
according to the principle
of harmony and balance.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Harmony and balance is
the fundamental principle

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:84%
on which the implicate
order-- it's not chaos.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not any of this.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It's always going to
take us back to harmony.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.247 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
vision boarding,

00:42:26.247 --> 00:42:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and we would look at putting
things on the board--

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk
about the lady who

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.330 align:middle line:84%
you were talking with that
said, I want $10 million.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:31.871 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK.

00:42:31.871 --> 00:42:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So some time ago, this
lady was sitting next to me

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:90%
in a program.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.740 align:middle line:84%
I was there participating
as a speaker.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And the speaker at the
time said, would you

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.810 align:middle line:84%
share with people whatever your
goals, et cetera, would be.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know even
if I shared a goal.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason
for that, and I'll

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.810 align:middle line:90%
explain that afterwards.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:57.290 align:middle line:84%
But she turned to
me, and she said,

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to manifest $10
million by the end of the year.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:84%
That gave her around about
four months or five months.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she was
broke at the moment?

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You're coming from a
base of being basically broke.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:15.169 align:middle line:84%
Now, my feedback
after the event, this

00:43:15.169 --> 00:43:16.460 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a program I was running.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But my feedback after the event
was that she went further down

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.820 align:middle line:90%
the hole afterwards.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you see,
you can't actually

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.730 align:middle line:84%
tell some folk, honey,
bear with me on this.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:35.060 align:middle line:84%
How deeply do you understand
the principles of consciousness

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.910 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to bring this in?

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, she believed that there
was a system and a process.

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't even
a matter of belief.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:47.000 align:middle line:84%
It was that she had
grasped hold of something

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.760 align:middle line:90%
without the foundation.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And if I do this and
this, it's got to happen,

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.910 align:middle line:84%
because the law
says it will happen.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:55.250 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't happen.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.265 align:middle line:84%
And that was another
life which went off

00:43:57.265 --> 00:44:00.890 align:middle line:84%
down the track into--
well, I can't say oblivion.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.237 align:middle line:84%
But see, that's where
the lessons come in.

00:44:03.237 --> 00:44:04.570 align:middle line:90%
And this is one of the beauties.

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:06.830 align:middle line:84%
When you started
our conversation,

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:10.860 align:middle line:84%
your point was, if I
recall rightly, you said,

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.949 align:middle line:84%
all these people that
are involved in New Age,

00:44:12.949 --> 00:44:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm involved in it.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:14.960 align:middle line:90%
You're involved in it.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.630 align:middle line:84%
How come so many people's
lives are a mess?

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:18.941 align:middle line:90%
How come--

00:44:18.941 --> 00:44:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not very functional.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, not
very functional.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
is quite simply

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that we don't look at--
even by doing things.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we took everything
that's given in "The Secret"

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and in vision boarding
and at face value,

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and saying, this is
really good stuff.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.695 align:middle line:84%
Which it has got great
merit in the right context.

00:44:39.695 --> 00:44:41.280 align:middle line:90%
In the right context.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But let's say that we work
with those principles.

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:47.120 align:middle line:84%
If the principles
do not give us what

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.950 align:middle line:84%
we want, and we end up
with say, a divorce,

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:52.949 align:middle line:84%
or we end up in a car accident,
because we're so upset--

00:44:52.949 --> 00:44:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That we lose our job?

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We've lost our job,
or we got sick or something.

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the door which all of
the great mystery traditions

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.330 align:middle line:90%
said walk through.

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if you walk through that
door, that is your initiation.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:06.740 align:middle line:90%
That is your death.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
that death, that

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.462 align:middle line:84%
is when the light will come, and
then you will look at who are,

00:45:11.462 --> 00:45:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and you will realize you
didn't want any of the stuff

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.910 align:middle line:84%
you put on the board
in the first instance.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:17.980 align:middle line:84%
What you wanted, to
walk through that door.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk
through that door,

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.340 align:middle line:90%
that is exactly what you wanted.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.656 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the naivete that
made a person-- took them

00:45:23.656 --> 00:45:26.280 align:middle line:84%
down that road to show up at the
conference in the first place,

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.071 align:middle line:84%
with the idea, I
need $10 million--

00:45:28.071 --> 00:45:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make $10 million
in the next four months.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.630 align:middle line:90%
It's going to come to me.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:33.990 align:middle line:90%
That's extreme naivete.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Or, or there is
a distinct possibility,

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and I put this in context
of our first discussion,

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:45.920 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of it is the mass
cultural hypnosis of our times.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to go
into that in just a minute.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But let's say the average
person is naive enough

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.962 align:middle line:90%
to believe that, OK.

00:45:52.962 --> 00:45:54.420 align:middle line:84%
If I just think
about it every day,

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have $10 million
in four months, not knowing

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.440 align:middle line:84%
that the acquisition of money
is yet another skill set that

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.080 align:middle line:84%
has been groomed by people
that have a lot of money,

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.200 align:middle line:84%
over perhaps lifetimes, to learn
to amass that kind of money.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.675 align:middle line:84%
Without any of even those
kinds of basic underpinnings

00:46:11.675 --> 00:46:14.450 align:middle line:84%
on a karmic level,
it's native to think

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:15.710 align:middle line:90%
that's going to happen.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just--
for the most part--

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:20.060 align:middle line:84%
put it in the
category of naivete.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:23.110 align:middle line:84%
But that very naivete, as
you're saying, is the gift.

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that naivete
leads to the broken heart,

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:84%
the disappointment takes
us through the door

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.910 align:middle line:84%
to our actual growth in the
beginning of establishing what

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:35.010 align:middle line:90%
is our authentic self and path.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Know thyself.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.379 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's not wasted.

00:46:38.379 --> 00:46:38.919 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No.

00:46:38.919 --> 00:46:39.500 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unless you just
go off, and disappointed,

00:46:41.625 --> 00:46:43.010 align:middle line:90%
and do something-- nothing.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Look, look.

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if-- I'm sure
we're both the same.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.220 align:middle line:84%
We've probably explored
so many different things.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I have had teachers and teachers
and teachers and teachers,

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and I would not be
in my own position

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:59.290 align:middle line:84%
if I hadn't have had teachers
who I greatly revered

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and teachers who I
wanted to shy away from,

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.600 align:middle line:84%
because they were some
of the best teachers.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ones that in an--
and by the way, in saying this,

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting for one
second I know the answers.

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.300 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
these are observations

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.280 align:middle line:90%
that have been made.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But some of the teachers who
have told me to do things

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:24.290 align:middle line:84%
have pushed other buttons which
have forced me maybe to get

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:26.350 align:middle line:84%
upset with myself,
because I'm upset

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.710 align:middle line:90%
with what they told me to do.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And that forces me
to go somewhere else

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:31.370 align:middle line:90%
to find my answers.

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So they all, every
single one of them,

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:36.757 align:middle line:84%
serves a purpose,
and a very good one.

00:47:36.757 --> 00:47:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.931 align:middle line:84%
But now, let's go
on another track

00:47:38.931 --> 00:47:40.930 align:middle line:84%
which you just alluded
to a moment ago, the mass

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:42.690 align:middle line:90%
cultural hypnosis.

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:46.365 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there have been
movements and teachers placed,

00:47:46.365 --> 00:47:49.390 align:middle line:84%
or who have placed themselves,
or in tandem with perhaps

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.330 align:middle line:84%
shadowy organizations
and whatnot,

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:56.420 align:middle line:84%
in place to literally
distract people

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.610 align:middle line:84%
from their own
potential power in life

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:03.740 align:middle line:90%
through the New Age movement?

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I believe-- and again,
this is a perception of my own.

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:10.720 align:middle line:90%
I believe that is so.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:17.350 align:middle line:84%
That there are-- if we took
it in context of the Bible

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:20.990 align:middle line:84%
teachings, and I'm not
a biblical scholar.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.612 align:middle line:84%
But if we took it in context
of the Bible's teachings,

00:48:23.612 --> 00:48:25.820 align:middle line:84%
it's like there would be
prophets and false prophets,

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.230 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, for a lot of
folks who follow very, very

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.670 align:middle line:84%
strongly in the Christian
faith, they see,

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:37.510 align:middle line:84%
these guys are all
teaching, including me.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:41.257 align:middle line:84%
Like you'd be one of the
worst, because you've got the--

00:48:41.257 --> 00:48:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I would be.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But the
answer to that is yes.

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, even
if they are leading people

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:55.020 align:middle line:84%
down the track of
false teaching,

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:58.240 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing
is taking a mess

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.710 align:middle line:84%
down the track of
false teaching,

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:04.530 align:middle line:84%
so that the mask can go through
that portal of initiation.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.271 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As we were
speaking about a moment ago.

00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It just
means that where

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:14.470 align:middle line:84%
we are at this moment in time,
in this grand cycle, if you

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:19.940 align:middle line:84%
will, of unfolding, is
opening a door to a higher

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.120 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness
which can only

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.400 align:middle line:84%
come when enough people
walk through that portal.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So some of these teachers, some
of these relatively planted

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:36.110 align:middle line:84%
negative teachers, they're
actually serving the light.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's the
silver lining of it all.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:43.750 align:middle line:84%
How would you say we
would recognize that kind

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:45.500 align:middle line:90%
of teaching, for example?

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.550 align:middle line:84%
What would a common
thread of messages

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:50.780 align:middle line:84%
be in what you would
consider to be more a plant.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Someone who is misguiding
or misinforming us.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I guess one
of two primary options.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:02.660 align:middle line:84%
One is where there is an
excessive play on fear,

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.560 align:middle line:84%
with the potential to
resolve all issues, being

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.530 align:middle line:90%
made very clear.

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.550 align:middle line:84%
You do this, you
will get answers.

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.050 align:middle line:90%
And come with me.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And then people get caught
up in mind connectivity,

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.700 align:middle line:84%
because-- let me
give you an example,

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.155 align:middle line:84%
and I'll come to the
second one in a moment.

00:50:23.155 --> 00:50:31.620 align:middle line:84%
But by example, we have what are
called these mind vibrations,

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.010 align:middle line:84%
thought lines, if you
will, which make up part

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.860 align:middle line:90%
of who we are and what we are.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the average human
being, and I place myself

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.030 align:middle line:84%
in that area, but the
average human being

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:45.400 align:middle line:84%
has got infinite
type of receptors,

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:48.940 align:middle line:84%
if you will, out, picking up
things like anger and hurt

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and pain and
frustration, et cetera.

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.460 align:middle line:84%
The sage, the
great master being,

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.420 align:middle line:84%
the one who sits in
lava, the one who

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is that emirate, who is
the one of the heart,

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:04.250 align:middle line:84%
has spent perhaps many
lifetimes, but at least

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:09.170 align:middle line:84%
this lifetime, learning to
recognize that not one of those

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:12.770 align:middle line:84%
has any reality in
directing them in this life.

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So if a sage, for
instance, is sitting down,

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:84%
he's got his head on a
rock, and he's meditating,

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and he's completely unaffected
by the rain and the thunder

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and the lightning, and a
child comes past and says,

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.190 align:middle line:90%
look at that silly old fool.

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.050 align:middle line:90%
He can't even afford a pillow.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And if he so much as stirs,
and he sniffles or anything,

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that concentration
is such that he

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:39.550 align:middle line:84%
has realized that that
mind impression was there,

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:40.965 align:middle line:90%
and he deals with it.

00:51:40.965 --> 00:51:41.590 align:middle line:90%
He releases it.

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And he goes back, and
he says thank you.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Over here, on the other
hand, someone comes along,

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and the mind
impression-- someone

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.230 align:middle line:90%
makes you angry or something.

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, the sage is
going to get scorned.

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:53.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.221 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the lesson.

00:51:54.221 --> 00:51:56.620 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we have so
many of the impressions,

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.960 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't sought
to refine the mind.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:03.090 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we pull upon
our reserve, our resources,

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:07.290 align:middle line:84%
bring them all up, and then we
project them out to the point

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.820 align:middle line:84%
where somebody else is
then on the receiving

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:13.430 align:middle line:84%
end of our unresolved,
unrefined mind.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So when a person comes
along and says to us, OK.

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Here's all your fears,
here's the solutions.

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.699 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we've
got these thought lines--

00:52:23.699 --> 00:52:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
the answer for you.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And so what happens
is, we go there, because these

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.650 align:middle line:90%
thought lines take us there.

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:90%
We want it.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Then, once we're in there,
there are other thought lines,

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:35.750 align:middle line:90%
like, follow me.

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Hey, follow me.

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.365 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any one that let
the guru thing going on it.

00:52:38.365 --> 00:52:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.388 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's right.

00:52:39.388 --> 00:52:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, a lot of
people give themselves over.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at people
giving themselves over,

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:48.680 align:middle line:84%
what we do is we hand over
personal responsibility.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, the whole principle of
all the different traditions

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.660 align:middle line:84%
which led up to
the New Age, which

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.810 align:middle line:84%
is where it got
watered down, was

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:59.070 align:middle line:84%
you take personal responsibility
by walking through the door.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Because this is about
self transformation

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.380 align:middle line:90%
and getting to know who you are.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at the mess of
people who may have gone across

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.150 align:middle line:84%
to say, one person, one
teacher-- doesn't matter--

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:16.300 align:middle line:84%
who cannot sit in that space
like the little old sage,

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and so has got their own stuff
going on, and they give power

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.430 align:middle line:84%
over, is there any wonder, at
this moment in time on this

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:26.750 align:middle line:84%
planet, that we have people
complaining about issues which

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:29.890 align:middle line:84%
are very valid, about
vaccination, is it right,

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:31.210 align:middle line:90%
is it wrong?

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Compulsory vaccination.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:37.140 align:middle line:84%
About the control of
banks and about all

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.690 align:middle line:84%
of the different
issues where we are

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:42.490 align:middle line:84%
handing over power at a
personal level to one person.

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:47.410 align:middle line:84%
We have literally handed
over all our power,

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and these people
are our surrogates.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying
to us, I'm going

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:52.950 align:middle line:90%
to take you through the portal.

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:54.650 align:middle line:84%
If you won't go
as an individual,

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I will collectively take
this group of people

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:58.250 align:middle line:90%
through the planet.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Which brings us to all
of the great epics.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.230 align:middle line:90%
All of the great epics.

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Each one of the demons
in the great epics

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.740 align:middle line:84%
always ended up
getting rewarded.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.440 align:middle line:84%
They always ended
up getting rewarded.

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:13.355 align:middle line:84%
So these characters who
may be the dark characters

00:54:13.355 --> 00:54:16.180 align:middle line:84%
are always going to get
rewarded for their working,

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:18.330 align:middle line:90%
taking people to the light.

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So all these characters which
are on the planet today,

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't care who they are,
It's like these ones are still

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:28.990 align:middle line:90%
taking us to the light.

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:33.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why when we speak about
God, in any form, in any place,

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:36.050 align:middle line:84%
in any tradition,
it's the omniscient,

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:37.480 align:middle line:90%
omnipotent, omnipresent.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's not
that's God and this is not.

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:43.510 align:middle line:84%
These little demons
are doing their work.

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:45.010 align:middle line:90%
We've got our own demons.

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe what
has been underestimated,

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that knowingness, that
path toward refinement,

00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:53.472 align:middle line:90%
is innate within our own beings.

00:54:53.472 --> 00:54:55.430 align:middle line:84%
We're going to stumble
upon it sooner or later,

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:58.800 align:middle line:84%
even if it takes a
challenge and some rather

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.630 align:middle line:84%
destructive behavior along
the way to catapult us back

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:03.060 align:middle line:90%
into our true--

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, you hit
the nail on the head.

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Man, know thyself.

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Woman, know thyself.

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, know thyself.

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Here's a classic,
because this goes back

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.128 align:middle line:90%
to the [INAUDIBLE] tradition.

00:55:12.128 --> 00:55:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't have any graphics
here, but many of your viewers

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:20.490 align:middle line:84%
would have heard of
the tree of life.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the tree of
life is a glyph,

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:24.650 align:middle line:84%
for the want of a
better term, and it's

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:27.780 align:middle line:84%
got 10 primary what
are called sephirot.

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And these are pure
energy centers,

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and there are literally
a total of 22 paths

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:34.840 align:middle line:90%
connecting these 10 centers.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, if anyone looks
at this tree of life,

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.110 align:middle line:90%
it is not symmetrical.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:47.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the center
channel has dropped down,

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and what we've got is a series
of energy centers going up.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But there is one
hidden energy center.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And that hidden energy center
is one which is called Da'at.

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:05.340 align:middle line:84%
D-A-A-T. Da'at in
Hebrew means to know.

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's a shadow one.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we come from the very
base on the tree of life--

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:11.990 align:middle line:90%
and we are the tree of life.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:13.490 align:middle line:90%
You and I are the tree of life.

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:16.790 align:middle line:84%
This studio in Gaiam
is the tree of life.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:19.150 align:middle line:84%
The state of Colorado
is the tree of life.

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:20.820 align:middle line:84%
The United States
is the tree of life.

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And we go on.

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:23.001 align:middle line:90%
Everything is the tree of life.

00:56:23.001 --> 00:56:25.100 align:middle line:90%
The planet is the tree of life.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is, each
one of those energies

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:30.190 align:middle line:90%
is present within us.

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:31.205 align:middle line:90%
It brings us anger.

00:56:31.205 --> 00:56:31.966 align:middle line:90%
It brings us joy.

00:56:31.966 --> 00:56:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It brings us sadness.

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.520 align:middle line:90%
It brings us peace.

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So we walk this
path all the time.

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:41.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the path of
the lone warrior.

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the way to bring
ourselves back to harmony,

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:49.730 align:middle line:84%
is when we've got all of
these spheres connected,

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:51.360 align:middle line:90%
and we push this one up.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And the whole thing goes up.

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
the Christ center,

00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:00.530 align:middle line:84%
the Krishna center, the Buddha
center, right in the middle,

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:04.360 align:middle line:84%
slaps itself right over
the hidden sephirot.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And that one, which
is dark, means

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:09.420 align:middle line:90%
we know through the heart.

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.710 align:middle line:90%
So we know through the heart.

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we know
through the heart,

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:15.500 align:middle line:84%
we have literally
opened the portal

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.150 align:middle line:84%
to the greatest gift we'll
ever have, which is to become,

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:20.780 align:middle line:90%
not only knowing who we are.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.210 align:middle line:84%
We have overcome the
limitations of mind,

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.500 align:middle line:84%
because we've entered
into the heart.

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is through the
heart that we actually then

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:34.000 align:middle line:84%
are able to dismiss the control
that the mind has had over us.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
have discernment.

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And so then, if we want to start
playing with our little vision

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:41.370 align:middle line:84%
boards and so forth, it's
being done in a different way

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and in a different spirit
that may be more in alignment

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:46.540 align:middle line:84%
with our true
selves, our Dharma.

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Whatever expressions of
our truth show themselves,

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.360 align:middle line:90%
we start aligning with that.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you can have
things start very nicely

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:59.140 align:middle line:84%
manifesting in your life,
because it's in alignment.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:00.145 align:middle line:90%
You've done the work.

00:58:00.145 --> 00:58:01.020 align:middle line:90%
You know who you are.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:03.740 align:middle line:84%
It's in alignment with
who you are, your purpose.

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And then desire, nothing
wrong with desire.

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:07.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful fuel.

00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:09.354 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It's a powerful fuel.

00:58:09.354 --> 00:58:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's one--
You know, we use desire

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.282 align:middle line:84%
in order to rise
to higher levels

00:58:16.282 --> 00:58:17.490 align:middle line:90%
where we can overcome desire.

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And so desire-- people, I
mean, that's another thing.

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Desire has been put-- really
put down as a dark force.

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing
dark about desire.

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Only desire that is kind
of random for purposes

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.290 align:middle line:90%
that are driven by fear.

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:36.550 align:middle line:84%
That's not the same as
that lovely, subtle thing

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that is propelling
you toward something.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.312 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, yes.

00:58:40.312 --> 00:58:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ultimately,
desire, in the grand scheme

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:52.370 align:middle line:84%
of all of these pathways we've
addressed here, is a motive.

00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:55.000 align:middle line:90%
It is a driving energy.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But it is one that helps
us reach a place where

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:03.345 align:middle line:84%
we can rise above it and
then go to a higher desire.

00:59:03.345 --> 00:59:04.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:59:04.095 --> 00:59:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's like,
people often say to me, how

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:08.805 align:middle line:90%
do you-- do we have free will?

00:59:08.805 --> 00:59:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Do we have free will?

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.300 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.550 align:middle line:90%
How do we get there?

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, my answer
is, you absolutely

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:17.400 align:middle line:84%
have free will,
until you realize

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.010 align:middle line:90%
you don't have free will.

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the journey there
is you have got such freedom

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.310 align:middle line:84%
to do what you need
to do, to go and use

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:28.670 align:middle line:84%
the principles of "The
Secret," the law of attraction,

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:30.340 align:middle line:84%
to do yoga, to do whatever
is in your calling.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's like going
out of alignment with yourself

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.440 align:middle line:84%
both ways until you start
finding that aligned point.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And then
what happens is,

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:40.430 align:middle line:84%
the more you get to these places
and walk through this door,

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:43.000 align:middle line:84%
then what happens is, you
walk through the door,

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.230 align:middle line:90%
you're fine tuning.

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:46.640 align:middle line:84%
You're coming like this,
and then all of a sudden,

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.270 align:middle line:84%
you realize you were
never ever controlling

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:51.990 align:middle line:90%
any of those outcomes.

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:55.290 align:middle line:84%
They were being controlled by
the absolute principle, which

00:59:55.290 --> 00:59:59.850 align:middle line:90%
by all circumstances, you are.

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So the god force within
you, the highest principle,

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.660 align:middle line:90%
was always taking you there.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once
that's met, then

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.600 align:middle line:84%
you can play within
these fields we're

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.630 align:middle line:84%
talking about with ease
and with good result.

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It gets me
like a short story

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.750 align:middle line:90%
to bring that to a point.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Because on the
vision board, right?

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:23.230 align:middle line:84%
There is Sivananda, often told
this beautiful little story

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:25.600 align:middle line:84%
about a teacher
sitting in his class.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.610 align:middle line:90%
And in comes this young boy.

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher's saying,
this is mathematics.

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And the kid's distracted.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the teacher says,
Enil, what's going on there?

01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And he says, oh, sorry.

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, sir.

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.589 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm distracted.

01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:41.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, what are
you thinking about?

01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:43.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm thinking
about my bull.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.637 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, I'm sorry
you can't stay in the class

01:00:45.637 --> 01:00:46.720 align:middle line:90%
and think about your bull.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Go and sit under a tree, think
about your bull for as long

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:49.630 align:middle line:90%
as you want.

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
When you've finally got
it out of your system,

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:52.642 align:middle line:90%
then you come back.

01:00:52.642 --> 01:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And don't come back
until you've done it.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:56.131 align:middle line:84%
Seven days he's
sitting under the tree,

01:00:56.131 --> 01:00:57.130 align:middle line:90%
thinking about the bull.

01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:58.869 align:middle line:84%
At the end of seven
days, he comes back.

01:00:58.869 --> 01:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
He gets to the classroom.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:00.890 align:middle line:84%
The teacher says,
are you finished?

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:02.150 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes, I'm over it, sir.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.450 align:middle line:90%
He said, good.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, come in.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:03.888 align:middle line:90%
He said, I can't.

01:01:03.888 --> 01:01:04.610 align:middle line:90%
He said, why not?

01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
He said, I can't get my
horns through the door.

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:07.139 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

01:01:07.139 --> 01:01:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And the reason
being, he had become one

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.420 align:middle line:90%
with his point of focus.

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.890 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you get a vision
board, when you get a vision

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.830 align:middle line:10%
board, be careful,
because you're

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:18.040 align:middle line:10%
going to become one
with the point of focus.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.674 align:middle line:84%
Make sure it's true
to your intent.

01:01:20.674 --> 01:01:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Be truthful.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.630 align:middle line:90%
That is the point.

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:25.200 align:middle line:90%
And we are out of time.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been so
enjoyable, as always.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.464 align:middle line:90%
It just flies.
