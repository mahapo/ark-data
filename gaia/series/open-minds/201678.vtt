>>REGINA MEREDITH: One
of the greatest intrigues

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.660 align:middle line:10%
among our audience
here at Gaia has

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.342 align:middle line:10%
to do with Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to
take a look at what

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:84%
happened to destroy
those ancient continents,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and new information
coming from Tom Moore.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:90%
And why now?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's find out, because
some of what's happening today,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
people start likening
to some of what

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle line:84%
happened in Atlantis, because
a lot of people who incarnated

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:90%
at that time are back.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, they're
in communities together

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:90%
and recognize each other.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And we'll work our way
toward, does this overlay--

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:84%
does the picture of what
happened then overlay

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
with anything going on
today toward the end

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:90%
of our conversation.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.137 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: And let's get
into "The Gentle Way"

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
series to refresh everyone
on what your background is,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.055 align:middle line:84%
and why we're talking about
Atlantis and Lemuria today.

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.810 align:middle line:10%
Back in 2005, the very first
time that I ever communicated

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:10%
with an Indian
shaman in the 1600s

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Reveals
the Mysteries, he said,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:10%
Tom, he said, you
have incarnated again

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:10%
into the 20th and 21st
centuries to reintroduce people

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:10%
to the Gentle Way.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:10%
He gave me the name of my
first book the very first time

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:10%
I ever talked to him.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm saying, gosh,
this guy's in the 1600s.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:90%
How does the Gentle Way?

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And so this kind of gnawed
on me for a couple of years.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And finally, a couple
of years later,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I was communicating with
Theo, my guardian angel.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Theo, how
old is the Gentle Way?

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking maybe
it's 1,000 years.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, Tom, it
dates all the way back

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to your Atlantean days,
when you were inspired

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
to create the
Gentle Way, and this

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:90%
was about 12,700 years ago.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
is the Gentle Way?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: The Gentle Way is a
simple, easy method for you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:84%
to request benevolent
outcomes in your life.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And it works
absolutely perfectly

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:90%
along with your soul contract.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's
on your soul path,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:84%
if it's within those
boundaries, your request

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:90%
will be given to you.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
These guardian angels are
actually golden light beings.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And the creator of this
universe asked for volunteers

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And these golden light
beings applied, shall we say.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And they take care of thousands
and thousands of souls

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
They're immensely powerful,
much more than we can imagine.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And the creator, out
of love, gave them

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:90%
the job of looking after us.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:84%
But they are to leave
us alone unless we

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:90%
request the assistance.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And if we request
the assistance,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:84%
even if it's for just a
parking spot, or your drive

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to and from work,
they will assist you,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:90%
but you have to ask.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
you're so right on,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
on two points, both
points you made,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
which are major and
often misunderstood.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
your desire will

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
be granted when it's coming
in alignment with the soul.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a
couple conversations

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
on this subject with
guests recently,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.778 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
important, because people

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
look at their lives and say,
oh, I've tried all these other--

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I've tried all the
secrets there are,

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and they don't seem
to work for me.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So again, separating
this out into what

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:90%
is in alignment with the soul.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:84%
The soul's desire, that's
where the help comes.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the answers are
given with ease and so forth.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But one has to determine with
that soul purpose or soul

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:90%
desire is.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: And it's hard.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.234 align:middle line:90%
They don't tell you.

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:16.734 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to figure it out.

00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: But if you request--

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:84%
keep requesting what I call
MBOs, most benevolent outcomes

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
in your life, it will keep
you on your social contract.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I've given the
example before that,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
since I'm in the film
distribution business

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
normally, at one point, I
and a friend of mine in Paris

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:84%
were going to try
and put together

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
a slate of about
five films based

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
on the spy novels of a
guy by the name of Cheney

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:90%
in World War II.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:90%
And I went all over the place--

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Paris, and Budapest, and
St. Petersburg, Russia,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and all this other stuff,
trying to put together

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:90%
the money to do these films.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And each time,
something really weird

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.547 align:middle line:84%
would come up that it
wouldn't go through.

00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And finally, I asked Theo.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I said, why didn't
this go through?

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Tom, he said,
had you gone down that path,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:84%
you would never reach
the number of people

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to reach with
your books and your speaking.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And conversely, you can
stumble into something,

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.870 align:middle line:90%
you think, oh my god.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Where's this wind under
my wings coming from?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Where you can do no
wrong because you've

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:90%
touched into something.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a project,
or a relationship,

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:84%
a path of some kind, even
a passion of yours that

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
is in alignment with
what the soul came

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:90%
to express in this lifetime.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's as though
it's greased lightning.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.072 align:middle line:84%
Things come to fruition
with such grace and ease.

00:05:51.072 --> 00:05:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: As long as you keep
requesting benevolent outcomes

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:84%
in your life, you're
headed down that path.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.108 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:57.108 --> 00:05:58.025 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: No off-sides.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, along that
same line, I did not

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:90%
want to be on television.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:90%
I had no interest in television.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Super shy.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I never even raised my
hand in class growing up.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And I did it on a dare.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.073 align:middle line:84%
And it's lasted me
an entire lifetime

00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
because I was
supposed to be doing

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I'm doing now.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.223 align:middle line:84%
But along the way, there are
projects that come and go,

00:06:20.223 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and some of them, you can bang
your head against the wall,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
like you trying to distribute
this, and others where--

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:90%
there was this one--

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll just get to this
because it's kind of fun.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine was a really
superb channeler in her day.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I still think of her as
the real hallmark of it.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And friend of mine was
having a channeling from her

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and said, why don't
you sit in and listen?

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And during the middle
of this session,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
the person who was channeling,
who's very passive,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and their eyes are closed, and
they look kind of dead almost,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
her hand went up, and the
finger went over and pointed

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
where I was in the corner
of room, and randomly said,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and you do something
about the trees.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So I was supposed
to somehow use media

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to pass on information about
protecting trees, I guess.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
They never said
any more than that.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, that was weird,
and that was random, right?

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So it was about a year and a
half later, all these events

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:90%
had transpired.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I ended up doing this
amazing documentary

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:84%
on the Sierra Nevada mountain
range, and the peril that

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
was occurring to
its water and trees

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:90%
in particular, the forests.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:90%
It was all done.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:90%
It won awards.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was being taken up by
universities and all of this

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:90%
for their educational purposes.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
thought, hold on a minute.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.808 align:middle line:90%
It was all about the trees.

00:07:45.808 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: About the trees.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And everything
we needed fell in.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, and more.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing I could have
done to screw that project up.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it was
in soul alignment.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:90%
And so it's just--

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I love giving examples
here and there

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.980 align:middle line:84%
about how this stuff actually
works, because you can feel it

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.813 align:middle line:90%
when it's happening.

00:08:04.813 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You can almost-- you can't
ruin it when it's right, right?

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.515 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And all the trees on
Earth all have group souls.

00:08:12.515 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And so
I've communicated

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:84%
with pine tree soul, oak
tree soul, among others.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, redwood.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm a tree lover.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I just had never thought
of doing anything

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
about the trees with my
professional line of work.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:90%
But here you go.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So the trees actually--
whole bunch of legislation

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:84%
happened after that,
and the trees actually

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:84%
were in much better
shape for their futures

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:90%
after we did this project.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:37.980 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
We did something
about the trees.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.603 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get onto Atlantis,
because a lot of people,

00:08:43.603 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
they understand
the myth, and they

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
think of it as one golden high
culture that became corrupt,

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.720 align:middle line:90%
and boom, it was gone in a day.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, it's a
much longer, much more

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:90%
rich and complex history.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Many, many races existed
there simultaneously.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about the Atlantis

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:90%
as it was explained to you.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And first of all,
how massive it was,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:90%
and where it was located sure.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Atlantis,
the continent,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:84%
was explained to me as being 10%
larger than today's Australia.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:10%
And it was located in between
North America, and Europe,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:10%
and Africa.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:10%
It was in the shape
of a parallelogram,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:10%
and the top of it was at
about the 47th parallel,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:10%
and the bottom of
most of the continent

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:10%
was around the 30th parallel.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And it had a tail that actually
extended all the way down

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:90%
to the Bahamas.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And it was about 100 miles--

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
came down parallel
to North America

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:84%
about 100 miles off
the coast, and it

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
came within 30 miles of
the continent of Africa.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think this is
something people don't often

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
understand, is how large
this continent was.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
different cultures

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.945 align:middle line:84%
that were present,
and the time-frame.

00:10:09.945 --> 00:10:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about-- we've kind of

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
got an idea of what it was like
geographically, and landmass.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the span of
time that it existed over.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or let's say
that civilization there

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:90%
existed over.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.527 align:middle line:90%
That's a different question.

00:10:24.527 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Homo sapiens were
placed there 60,000 years ago.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:34.880 align:middle line:84%
60,000-- that's a long time
when you think how much-- where

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:84%
we've come in 6,000 or 7,000
years of recorded history.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.394 align:middle line:90%
That's all we have.

00:10:42.394 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And so here, they
were in existence

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:90%
from 60,000 years ago.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce mentioned
the first destruction.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And in my meditations, they
sort of skip over that.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
They said the continent wasn't
that peopled at that time

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:84%
period when that first
destruction happened

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:90%
when the poles reversed.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, there were
people on the coasts that died.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:90%
But they kind of go past that.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So they jump to the really,
really big destruction, which

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.275 align:middle line:90%
was about 31,000 years ago.

00:11:25.275 --> 00:11:26.075 align:middle line:90%
But in between--

00:11:26.075 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would've
been the middle destruction.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big one.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:84%
That was very
traumatic, and changed

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
the way humanity would develop
from that point forward.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So in that time period,
from 60,000 to 31,000,

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:90%
they were given free energy.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:84%
They had what were
called posers.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
These were giant crystal
towers about 25 feet tall,

00:11:55.370 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and they were magnetically
generated, activated,

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
so that they put out a
signal, like a radio signal,

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and it was limited by the
curvature of the Earth,

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
so they had to have these posers
every few miles because all

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
their airplanes, all
their buses, and trolleys,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and everything-- cars--

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
they all ran on this
broadcast energy.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:90%
So it had limits.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
The cars and all could only
travel about 65 miles an hour.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Cars were mostly used
by government people.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else used mostly
public transportation.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.720 align:middle line:90%
But they had free energy.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.700 align:middle line:90%
All their homes were lit.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything was taken care
of by this free energy.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The problem is they eventually
misused this free energy

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:90%
and developed laser weapons.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and this
is interesting because

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:84%
of all the different-- there
are so many different renderings

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.170 align:middle line:84%
from different people
that have remembrances

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:90%
of being in Atlantis.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of people
that have incarnated at this

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:90%
time-- a lot--

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
who had multiple
incarnations in Atlantis.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:90%
You have, I have.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Probably most of the people
in this studio and watching

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:84%
have had lives in
Atlantis at one time.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And it depended on where
you were in the society

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:84%
at a given time,
what your role was.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing that
everyone seems to agree on

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is that free energy was the
means of energy distribution.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:84%
When I've been back
into those lifetimes,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:84%
there was never a cable,
or a pole, or a wire.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.020 align:middle line:90%
There was none of that.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.540 align:middle line:84%
The energy is free and
present within a house.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:84%
The lighting sources
were naturally--

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be illuminated
from within, right?

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the free energy,
as we know now--

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:84%
scalar energies, scalar
waves, et cetera--

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
have the potential
to be weaponized.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, the channel I
mentioned earlier,

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
one time when she was taken back
by her husband in a past life,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:90%
was talking about--

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and I want to know what
you received on this--

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.120 align:middle line:84%
was talking about
a period of history

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:84%
where they were being
attacked from the air.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
for cover in an area

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.040 align:middle line:90%
that was very heavily forested.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
What other civilizations were
interfacing with Atlantis

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.510 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I think the person went
back to a time at Poseidia.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.555 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.555 --> 00:14:31.355 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:14:31.355 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So explain that.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.100 align:middle line:84%
31,000 years ago-- keep in
mind, the continent of Atlantis

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
was sitting right on top
of the mid-Atlantic ridge.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.700 align:middle line:84%
There was a line of
volcanoes, super volcanoes,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:84%
sitting right on top of
that mid-Atlantic ridge.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:84%
They all exploded
at the same time

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and the continent
of Atlantis sank.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exploded is
the right word, yeah.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And the continent broke
apart, and most of it

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:84%
sank, leaving islands here and
there that were still around,

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle line:84%
most of them today, except
for an island called Poseidia.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was the size of
Cuba in rounded shape.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And then 375 miles to the
south, and on a direct line

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:90%
out from Washington, DC--

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.542 align:middle line:90%
interesting--

00:15:20.542 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:90%
--was Aryan.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And Aryan was about
the size of Hispaniola.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And there were five
smaller islands

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
right below that, all
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So all the oceans
of the world went up

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.150 align:middle line:84%
160 feet because
of the displacement

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:90%
when this continent sank.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And millions of people
all over the world

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:84%
drowned when the oceans rose
160 feet and stayed there.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So we had these islands
left, and it took them

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:90%
quite a long time to recover.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you have all this
mud, which was mentioned,

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:90%
I think by Plato or someone.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
All this mud in the oceans
that stayed a long, long time.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.435 align:middle line:90%
It was un-navigable.

00:16:13.435 --> 00:16:14.235 align:middle line:90%
Navigable.

00:16:14.235 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, but finally,
it went away.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
these societies ran.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the
people that followed

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:84%
the religious beliefs, the
law of one, were on Poseidia.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And the Sons of
Belial were mostly

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.925 align:middle line:84%
on Aryan, and those
little islands below it.

00:16:39.925 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:90%
So that sets up--

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and this, again, it
goes from 31,000.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they went to
war against each other,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:90%
that was 12,500 years ago.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:54.925 align:middle line:90%
In the later stages.

00:16:54.925 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: In the later stages--

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before the
ultimate destruction.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.758 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: They were
already warring.

00:16:58.758 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
They were already sinking
ships, and yada-yada-ya.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:84%
What your friend may have seen
was that 12,500 years ago,

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
the Sons of Belial
people said, we just

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:90%
can't take these people anymore.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's wipe them off
the face of the Earth.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And so they did what I call
a Pearl Harbor attack, where

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
early in the morning, they had
about 325 of these aircraft,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and they went up with
these laser weapons

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and attacked Poseidia.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And using these laser
weapons, it could literally

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:84%
melt the ground people
stood on ground,

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:90%
and the people themselves.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
The people of Aryan thought
they knew where all the airbases

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
were on Poseidia,
but they didn't.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the Poseidians
retaliated.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And this went back and forth,
and finally, all the islands

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:90%
sank to the bottom the ocean.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:84%
The oceans rose 41
feet at that point.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the
story of Noah was created.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:84%
The story of Noah was
in all the religions,

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:84%
although the Indians
changed his name to Manu

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:90%
for Indian purposes.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
He actually did build this
ark, and it actually did float,

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
but the oceans were
only up 41 feet,

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:84%
so not all the
world was covered.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:90%
It's just people thought it was.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he did
land on the lower slopes

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
of Mount Ararat,
and one of his sons

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:84%
married a girl from a
part of the world that

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:90%
was not covered with water.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So we've covered
quite a bit there.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Sorry.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
when we're looking

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
at historical references,
as we know in modern times,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
history is written
by the victors.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's really
the collective memory

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.410 align:middle line:84%
of people like you
and me, and people

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:84%
watching this, that's
going to piece together

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.615 align:middle line:84%
when Atlantis truly was over
that long, long time-frame.

00:19:05.615 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that's not understood

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.430 align:middle line:84%
is Egypt had a very,
very ancient culture.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.760 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't 10,000,
15,000, 20,000 years.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.754 align:middle line:84%
This existed simultaneously
with Atlantis.

00:19:14.754 --> 00:19:15.554 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: 300,000.

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:15.821 align:middle line:90%
400,000.

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:16.621 align:middle line:90%
500,000.

00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, exactly.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And so there was not
just communication--

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and I think this is where a
lot of what's interesting comes

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:84%
in, is if we can simply get
comfortable with the fact,

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:84%
there has been air travel
on this planet for--

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and technology for
a very long time.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.625 align:middle line:84%
It explains a lot
about how cultures

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that shouldn't be
where they are,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:84%
languages that shouldn't
be where they are, are.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
The movements of
groups of people,

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and the re-establishment of
cultures around the planet.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, this happened in the
times of Lemuria and Atlantis,

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and in Egypt, like you say, even
to the point of devastating air

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:90%
battles.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And so then you had ships.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about them
as a seafaring culture

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:84%
as well, because they
establish connections with--

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
even up into Scandinavia
and Britain many,

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:90%
many thousands of years ago.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're already
migrating to some

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
of these areas with
some of the knowledge

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that they possessed
at that time.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some of
those migratory patterns.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, the Atlanteans
were pretty aggressive people.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So they actually conquered
most of the Mediterranean.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, they had a very
aggressive sect of people,

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.770 align:middle line:84%
but not all of them
were aggressive.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:90%
There were a lot of races there.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And some that had the
technology were more aggressive.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the one place that
they never could conquer

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:84%
was Africa, even
though the continent

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:90%
came within 30 miles of Africa.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
They tried a couple
of times, because I

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
was a soldier in
two lives in which I

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
got killed with the force
trying to invade Africa.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And they had this Achilles heel
where these aircraft could only

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:90%
operate in the daytime.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why, but--

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It probably had
something to do with the sun.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: In the daytime, yeah.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and I think
maybe in my book,

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:84%
I may have said 2,000 warriors,
but I've since been told,

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
no, Tom, you just didn't believe
there could be so many more,

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.450 align:middle line:84%
but it was actually 20,000
Masai kind of warriors

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:28.860 align:middle line:90%
would wait until darkness.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And they would come,
and they just literally

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:90%
wiped out the invading forces.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they never
could conquer Africa.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.872 align:middle line:84%
And this was something I
just came across recently I

00:21:42.872 --> 00:21:45.080 align:middle line:84%
thought was fascinating,
and I'm going to bring it up

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:90%
in another conversation.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.370 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
some of those who

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle line:84%
had emigrated from
the northern part,

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
perhaps when the very
first destruction occurred.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And this was not something
that was unknown.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It didn't happen
in a flash, per se.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.060 align:middle line:84%
There was some knowledge and
instability of the Earth.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So in the northern
part, some of the people

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
who were more aggressive
in nature, and seafaring,

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:84%
had gone to Scandinavia
and started mating

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.230 align:middle line:84%
with the indigenous
Norse people of the day,

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and created what are now known
today as the mighty Vikings.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:84%
That these were Atlantean
and Scandinavian hybrids

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:84%
from the very early
days of Atlantis.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I thought that
was fascinating.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.742 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I've
ever given consideration to.

00:22:30.742 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And I haven't asked
enough questions of that, so--

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
ask some questions

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:90%
and see what's in there.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: --I'm going to
have to ask some questions.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this
was a mighty race that

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:90%
is still known to this day.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
We're still doing
television series

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
based on the ferocity
of this race of people.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:90%
And the physicality.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The large stature and
strength of the Viking people.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So again-- so that's some
information I'd read about.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.950 align:middle line:84%
But I want to go now
to this 31,000 years

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.463 align:middle line:84%
ago middle destruction,
the second destruction,

00:23:02.463 --> 00:23:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and talk about the nature of
it, because you used the word

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.363 align:middle line:84%
explosion, and I believe that
is one of the prominent times I

00:23:09.363 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:90%
had been regressed to.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know I was going there.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.178 align:middle line:84%
Turned out that's
where I ended up,

00:23:13.178 --> 00:23:15.740 align:middle line:84%
was on one of the
destructions of Atlantis,

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.660 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't the final one.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And I had deduced by now
it was the middle one.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:84%
It's as though everything
just exploded and melted.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.290 align:middle line:90%
It was horrific.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Talk about it from
your perspective,

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and what you've
been told and know.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Oh.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we're
still traumatized by it,

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:90%
people that were around.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MOORE: I mean, when I have
people asking questions of me,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.495 align:middle line:10%
they don't understand that there
were stages of destruction.

00:23:47.495 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they don't.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: And even there was a--

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:84%
we'll eventually get to Lemuria,
where they destroyed themselves

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:84%
too, and the oceans
rose 170 feet.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So we've had three major
times in our history

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:84%
where the oceans rose 160, 41
feet, and 170 feet or more.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So it coordinates with
scientists saying,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
well, the oceans
rose 375 to 400 feet,

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:84%
but probably, it just
rose a foot every century.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that way.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:90%
It actually--

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:90%
Calamities, right.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Calamities.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about this distraction

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:84%
where things
exploded, so to speak.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I know that there were
places like Bermuda,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.265 align:middle line:90%
and the Canary Islands, and--

00:24:43.265 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Azores.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: --and the
Bahamas that were left.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.662 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they tell you
the nature of the explosions?

00:24:51.662 --> 00:24:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Only that
it was volcanic.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I can help
fill in that piece,

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:84%
because Dolores Cannon
regressed me back to that time.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I was
going there at all.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going
somewhere else entirely,

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:90%
but I ended up there.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.715 align:middle line:84%
And at that time-- and I don't
want to bore the viewers.

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:09.590 align:middle line:90%
I think I mentioned--

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I did mention this
in another show,

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:90%
but it's been a long time.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
was, there was--

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.020 align:middle line:84%
over a long period of time, this
energy had been building up.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So it was becoming unstable
for quite a long time.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be
with a group of women

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
that worked in one
particular temple,

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and our job was literally
to work telepathically

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and with our
energies, projecting

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:84%
them to try to hold the
Earth energy stable.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
But in the outside
world, there were

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:84%
those working with the
crystalline technologies

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.060 align:middle line:90%
of the day.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were amping
up the technologies--

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:84%
again, everything was trying
to stop what was inevitable.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Stop the eruption
by using force,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:90%
thinking you can control it.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:90%
We were using telepathic force.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:84%
They were using crystal
energy technology force.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It didn't work, and we all
knew that it was going to blow.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting
was that in that day--

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and this has been validated
by two other people totally

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:84%
separately from me who were
there and saw the same thing--

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.510 align:middle line:84%
there were spacecraft that were
in the near atmosphere hovering

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:90%
right above.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:90%
They too were trying to--

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I think some people
were with them.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:90%
They'd taken some people.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But they were also trying
to hold the energies to stop

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:84%
the loss of what
was going to happen,

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
because it was a pretty
advanced culture,

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.260 align:middle line:90%
and a lot was going to be lost.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But this gets back to what
you said about the ships only

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.010 align:middle line:90%
working in the daytime.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So what I kept saying
in this regression was,

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.933 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, we've
ruined everything.

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought the guys
with the crystalline technology

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:90%
were ruining things.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:90%
They were trying to help.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't know.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I was cloistered.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, we've ruined everything.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:84%
We have the most delicate,
perfect, matrix with the sun

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have developed in
relationship to the sun.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So there was something
about the sun--

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and I could see it
as a lattice work--

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and the technologies
we were working

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.320 align:middle line:90%
with that worked together.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
beautifully developed.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we're
going to lose it now,

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be a long
time before we wake up

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.330 align:middle line:90%
and remember this again.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.425 align:middle line:84%
So that might have
something to do--

00:27:16.425 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
the nature of it

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.500 align:middle line:84%
anymore than just that, because
this happened very quickly,

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:84%
that the sun and the
crystalline energy technologies

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:90%
were dependent on each other.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.325 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Obviously,
I have more to ask.

00:27:24.325 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huh?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Obviously,
I have more to ask.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, ask
more about all that,

00:27:27.647 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
because I need to ask pieces
you have and vice versa.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So now we have this culture, and
some of these aggressive folks

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:90%
have gone off.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about all the
places that the Atlanteans had

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:84%
emigrated to over time, and
where their culture affected

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.628 align:middle line:90%
other peoples in other lands.

00:27:44.628 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Well, are we talking
about the aggressors where they

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.052 align:middle line:90%
went and conquered--

00:27:48.052 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
there are also those who were

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:84%
poets, and mathematicians, and
such that went to other areas.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Yeah, but this
was all before the 31,000.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Because once that destruction
happened, everything--

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:90%
everyone came back.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.390 align:middle line:90%
They left these places.

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But they also left
their history.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So as an example, when I got
down to about 12,700 years

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:20.270 align:middle line:84%
ago, where I had
created the Gentle Way,

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and I had about a
million people that

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.870 align:middle line:84%
were requesting benevolent
outcomes in their lives.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But then I was told
by off-world people,

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and even flown in a
spaceship over to Egypt,

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:45.280 align:middle line:90%
that this is going to go badly.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
destroy themselves,

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.840 align:middle line:90%
and you need to emigrate.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And so with 25,000
people, we immigrated

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:59.650 align:middle line:84%
through Spain, and
France, what have you.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And we all finally
made it over to Egypt.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, Edgar Cayce
mentions that he

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:84%
had a life as Ra Ta, who was
banished to some outer place.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And they brought him back
to deal with the Atlanteans.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And that was my group.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.083 align:middle line:84%
Because they thought,
gosh, here's 25,000.

00:29:25.083 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
conquer us again,

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.860 align:middle line:84%
because they had all these old
records of being conquered.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And we had to explain to them
that we were gentle people,

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and we were not there
to conquer anybody.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
Egyptian princess that

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:90%
helped us in our resettlement.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's my wife today.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, in her next life,
it'll be 12,500 years ago,

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:84%
approximately, and
she's going to be a he,

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to be a
major leader of his people,

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
be his assistant.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:06.090 align:middle line:84%
But that's a past life for
me and my wife's future life,

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:90%
her next life.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, understanding
that time is not linear.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: You can have lives
going on at the same time

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.290 align:middle line:90%
as you have other lives.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And it just all depends of what
your soul needs for growth.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So now we're talking
about the people

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
through these various
destructions who

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.690 align:middle line:84%
have then left and have
influenced others who made it

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
through, whether they were
taken out in an aircraft,

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.360 align:middle line:84%
or whether they found their
way via some kind of seafaring

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:90%
vessel, made their way.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:45.155 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding is to
the north, a lot of what we--

00:30:45.155 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:84%
we don't see it as
it originally was,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:54.650 align:middle line:84%
but the druidic culture from
Ireland and throughout Britain

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:84%
was really a result of knowledge
that had been brought over

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:90%
in the higher days of Atlantis.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And that a lot of that was
then inculcated, and then

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.680 align:middle line:90%
kept among the druids.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And still today, what's
remaining of the druids,

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
they still have some of
that original knowledge,

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.820 align:middle line:90%
but it was kept.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was primarily
an oral history.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But also written,
but in a way that's

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.670 align:middle line:84%
coded that we
wouldn't understand.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.550 align:middle line:84%
The alphabetic
letters, for example,

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.580 align:middle line:90%
each represented a tree.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So very interesting
intelligent encoding.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So here, you have
this wonderful group

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
of people holding onto the
higher esoteric knowledge.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Way up north in the
very early days,

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.610 align:middle line:84%
you have some barbaric
behavior, really,

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.200 align:middle line:90%
in conquering other areas.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about what happened.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Oh, last year at this time,
we were in Sardinia shooting.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that the
Sardinians were talking about

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:84%
is they have a history
of a race of giants.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They believe they're
descendants of the Atlanteans,

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.870 align:middle line:84%
or that Atlanteans certainly
were present there.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're afraid
of these tidal waves.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.223 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of the sea shore.

00:31:57.223 --> 00:31:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I said,
well, do you swim?

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.473 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, no, we
don't go near the sea.

00:32:00.473 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:84%
There's this deep
cultural memory

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:84%
of being inundated with
water, which would go

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:90%
with what you're saying, right?

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.188 align:middle line:84%
And this is throughout-- so
that's the Mediterranean.

00:32:12.188 --> 00:32:13.040 align:middle line:90%
That's one part.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And this exists in a lot
of different cultures,

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.568 align:middle line:84%
these same thoughts,
remembrances, and fears.

00:32:18.568 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: A lot of
people have fears--

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's go west.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:84%
What happened-- North
America bordered it too.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that far away.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the influences there.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: One of the things that
happened after this destruction

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.400 align:middle line:84%
31,000 years ago
was that they had

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:84%
the find crystals to
replace the ones that

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.680 align:middle line:90%
were lost in the destruction.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So they wound up
going to an area

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.560 align:middle line:90%
near Hot Springs, Arkansas.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say, yeah.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And they actually
would have mining towns.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And a mining town would be there
with maybe 125 or 150 people.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And they would mine
out a certain area.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:84%
They had devices that would
find these large crystals.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
They weren't quite as
good as maybe the ones

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that they had because of
all the volcanic activity

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
on the Atlantean
continent, but they were

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.900 align:middle line:90%
able to find large crystals.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And so they'd mine an area.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Then they'd move the
whole town to another area

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.570 align:middle line:84%
not too far away,
and another area.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And they would
actually fly these--

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:90%
I think they flew them--

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:84%
these crystals
back to the coast,

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and then transport
them back over to--

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The islands
that were still remaining.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.050 align:middle line:90%
And this worked for a long time.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.720 align:middle line:84%
There really was
this transportation

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.520 align:middle line:90%
of these crystals.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've been told that
even some of the people--

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:84%
the farmers that live to
the west of Hot Springs

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.710 align:middle line:90%
have found tunnels.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.317 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want
anyone on their property,

00:34:04.317 --> 00:34:05.900 align:middle line:84%
so they don't tell
anybody about them.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.793 align:middle line:84%
So once the final
destruction occurred,

00:34:11.793 --> 00:34:13.460 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
factors at play here.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.670 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about, it seems
a lowering of consciousness

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that was occurring from
the very early days on.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
re-establishment

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:23.659 align:middle line:84%
of certain practices
and understandings

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt and throughout
the world, right?

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And by
the way, with me, I

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.409 align:middle line:84%
took a couple of
healing instruments.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.219 align:middle line:84%
And one was like a healing
bowl, and supposedly, it's

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:42.530 align:middle line:84%
in a museum somewhere, and
nobody knows what it does.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So I smuggled these
out of Atlantis

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't supposed
to take them with you.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:53.389 align:middle line:90%
And I did healings in Egypt.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:35:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I was called a priest,
but they were very limited

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:90%
on their vocabulary.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.760 align:middle line:84%
This was really a
third world country.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.395 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody
was called priest.

00:35:09.395 --> 00:35:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of like
a healing priest.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you had any
knowledge, you were a priest.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:14.753 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Probably, yes.

00:35:14.753 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So have you figured
out where that is yet?

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Are you going on a treasure
hunt to find the bowl?

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: No.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.597 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:35:20.597 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let it go.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Let it go until next time.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So the final destruction
has occurred.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, we already know that
people like yourself and others

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.600 align:middle line:84%
had already made
their way to Egypt

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and taken whatever knowledge
they had with them.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:38.590 align:middle line:90%
So you--

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.585 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And other
people went to Yucatan.

00:35:40.585 --> 00:35:42.627 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, into
Yucatan as well, absolutely.

00:35:42.627 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: And Guatemala.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So we weren't the only
group that was escaping.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.128 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, we were
one of the larger groups.

00:35:50.128 --> 00:35:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
even another guy--

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and I can't remember his name--

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that brought a separate
group of people.

00:35:56.290 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was out to be a leader
in Egypt, and I wasn't.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to take
care of my group.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.890 align:middle line:90%
I was a religious leader.

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I was not-- per se,
I was simply having

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:12.910 align:middle line:90%
people follow the Gentle Way.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
some thought, then,

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:19.120 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking
about going west,

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.260 align:middle line:84%
that the Mayan culture was
established also based on--

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:84%
that was originally part of
a remnant of the Atlantean

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:84%
culture, were the Mayans with
their advanced understandings

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.180 align:middle line:84%
of mathematics, and these
beautiful cities that

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:84%
were established in South
America, and such, and Central

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.440 align:middle line:84%
America, that this was also a
remnant of Atlantean knowledge

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.910 align:middle line:90%
and culture.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Most of it which has
been lost to time,

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:46.040 align:middle line:84%
is buried underneath jungles,
and is now being rediscovered.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow, how did you
have such technology in the day?

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is fascinating
on so many levels.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hancock's work has looked
at going into South America,

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.110 align:middle line:84%
into the Amazon,
and looking at some

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.420 align:middle line:84%
of the remnants of these
amazing cities that

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.360 align:middle line:84%
had to have been after the
destruction of Atlantis.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a really popular
subject right now.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go back
further to Lemuria,

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:84%
because my understanding is
Lemuria and Atlantis also

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.870 align:middle line:84%
were culturally somewhat
concurrent with each other.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to Lemuria, which
preceded it, but ended up

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:22.730 align:middle line:90%
overlapping with Atlantis.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:29.920 align:middle line:84%
So I was told that I've had,
between Atlantis and Lemuria,

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.250 align:middle line:90%
somewhere around 180 lives.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:37.404 align:middle line:84%
And I was told
that I'm probably--

00:37:37.404 --> 00:37:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only person
on Earth that

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:84%
has had that many lives
on both continents.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So when I ask about
Lemuria, I was told 65.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why so few?

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:10%
And I was told that Lemuria,
for thousands of years--

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:10%
and they were populated
at the same time Atlantis,

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.950 align:middle line:10%
the Atlantean continent
was 60,000 years ago

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:01.490 align:middle line:10%
with Homo sapiens.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So for thousands of years, they
had a very idyllic society.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Very easygoing.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't need as many
lives there due to the fact

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:21.490 align:middle line:84%
that they were much different
than the Atlantean people were.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.360 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot of
things going on.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were living
in more close companionship

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:90%
throughout with nature.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Nature spirits, the
spiritual world in general.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.745 align:middle line:90%
So it was a more gentle reality.

00:38:31.745 --> 00:38:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: A gentle reality.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And actually,
until the big destruction

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlantean continent,
when the seas rose 170 feet,

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.260 align:middle line:84%
they were actually
connected to Japan.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And so this continent was 12%
larger than Australia is today.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And it extended within
100 miles of Hawaii.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And for thousands of years, the
Lemurians vacationed on Hawaii.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why you
can feel this Lemurian

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.880 align:middle line:90%
energy when you go to Hawaii.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very gentle.

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And even-- and this gentleness
extended all the way down

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.820 align:middle line:84%
to within about 1,000 years
before their destruction,

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:90%
which was 7,500 years ago.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.490 align:middle line:84%
As things picked up, and they
started being more warlike,

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.830 align:middle line:84%
there were five
countries that inhabited

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.510 align:middle line:90%
the continent of Lemuria.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:37.180 align:middle line:84%
They were divided like Europe
is today by mountains, rivers,

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.020 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.880 align:middle line:90%
So there were five countries.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they continued
to vacation in Hawaii,

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:84%
but each country would
have their own beach.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And so some beaches
would be inhabited

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.110 align:middle line:84%
by people that would
be very clothed,

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and other people might look
like the French on a beach.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.440 align:middle line:90%
So that's how they handled it.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.630 align:middle line:84%
They continued to
vacation on Hawaii.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.620 align:middle line:90%
So I've told people--

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm asked, well, how can I
feel the Lemurian energy again?

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:13.642 align:middle line:84%
Go to Hawaii, and you
can feel that energy.

00:40:13.642 --> 00:40:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
have their own legends

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:90%
about that in Hawaii.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the people of Mu were
considered a more gentle

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.280 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:90%
A people that were peaceful.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Peaceful at heart.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Not technologically driven.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And again, there are
so many remembrances

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.070 align:middle line:84%
of what life was
like on Lemuria.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, where does, say, Polynesia,
Chile, New Zealand, California,

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.605 align:middle line:90%
even, come into the story?

00:40:37.605 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:42.470 align:middle line:84%
In that last 1,000
years, their technology

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.490 align:middle line:90%
was really picking up.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.700 align:middle line:90%
They became more warlike.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my case, I
was asking one day,

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, did I ever
have a life on Lemuria?

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.740 align:middle line:90%
And Theo said, ah, Tom.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And when he says that, I'm
going to hear something.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, you helped
destroy the continent.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So it turned out that I was
a religious leader in one

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.080 align:middle line:90%
of the five countries.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And we really were
getting warlike.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And we had developed
the equivalent

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:90%
of the hydrogen bombs.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we didn't think
these other two countries

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:31.760 align:middle line:90%
had developed hydrogen bombs.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I encouraged them,
oh, yeah, let's go ahead

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.010 align:middle line:90%
and attack them.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:90%
And so we did.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:90%
But they did have.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And they retaliated with
their own hydrogen bombs.

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's what brought
that continent up.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well--

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And it took me 85 or
87 lives to balance that one--

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I consider it my
worst life on Earth.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, we all have screw-ups.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.380 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Oh, that
was a major one.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.768 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
saying 7,500 years ago,

00:42:04.768 --> 00:42:05.810 align:middle line:90%
this would have occurred.

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if
you're saying, then,

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.170 align:middle line:84%
what would the implication
have been with 170-foot tidal--

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:84%
essentially rise of
sea level at that time?

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Again-- and this
is why-- people say, well,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.230 align:middle line:84%
why don't we have
records of all this?

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:27.950 align:middle line:84%
It's because we've had three
times in our history, 160, 41,

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and 170 feet where the oceans
rose and drowned people

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.200 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
wiped out cities--

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:84%
all the cities, towns,
villages that were

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.960 align:middle line:84%
on the coasts of the world,
and all their records

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and everything were
all completely--

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Buried in mud.

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: --completely
wiped away.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So you start hearing
a common theme here,

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:54.650 align:middle line:84%
which is exhibiting
itself today.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Interests that are vested in, in
our case, in the profit of war,

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:00.965 align:middle line:90%
and the profit of disease.

00:43:00.965 --> 00:43:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Absolutely.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything that is
anti-life seems to be where

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.450 align:middle line:90%
the big money follows and goes.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:09.340 align:middle line:90%
So now, what--

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: So I'll tell you
something that's coming that

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I've been told--

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:17.720 align:middle line:84%
within the next year or so,
there's going to be someone--

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and it won't be someone,
it'll be like a corporation--

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:25.510 align:middle line:84%
that is going to give to the
world a free energy machine.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wouldn't
be surprised at that.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.385 align:middle line:84%
We've been sitting on the
precipice of it for ages.

00:43:29.385 --> 00:43:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that there
had been free energy machines

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:38.900 align:middle line:84%
before that were bought up by
the oil companies and buried.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But this one is
going to be given

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:44.390 align:middle line:84%
to the world with no
patent, so to speak.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And it will change
the world, because

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.760 align:middle line:84%
every single little
village in the world

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.747 align:middle line:84%
will be able to
have electricity.

00:43:54.747 --> 00:43:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's been what Steven
Greer and the Disclosure

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Project has talked about,
and a lot of people

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:04.190 align:middle line:84%
have talked about, that
really all of this--

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:84%
the game we're playing
right now comes to a close

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.280 align:middle line:84%
once free energy is
reintroduced to the planet.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And there are many, many
entities, people, even

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.350 align:middle line:84%
now corporations who are
vying with each other

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.510 align:middle line:90%
to be the first to introduce it.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But again, when you're
trying to corner a market,

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.930 align:middle line:84%
when you're trying to make
gajillions of dollars off of it

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:26.013 align:middle line:84%
as the first to market,
and patents and so forth--

00:44:26.013 --> 00:44:27.763 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: But they're
not going to do that.

00:44:27.763 --> 00:44:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --it doesn't happen.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.560 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't made it out.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you say someone's
going to freely offer it,

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.830 align:middle line:90%
now that's a game changer.

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: That's
the game changer.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
would be really exciting.

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: And it'll be like--

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I won't say it will
be a Bill Gates,

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:43.880 align:middle line:84%
but it might be someone
like that that will say,

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.180 align:middle line:84%
this is my gift, or this
is our gift to the planet.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all we can
do now is wait and see

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.650 align:middle line:90%
and hope that that is true.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And request
a benevolent outcome--

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:53.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And request
a benevolent outcome.

00:44:53.555 --> 00:44:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: --that it
comes even sooner

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:56.375 align:middle line:90%
than we can hope or expect.

00:44:56.375 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about, then,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.930 align:middle line:84%
just in wrapping things up
here, the relevance of talking

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:02.730 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and we can kind of see
it from what you just

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:08.030 align:middle line:84%
said-- the relevance of having
some knowledge about Lemuria,

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:12.560 align:middle line:84%
or even checking into our own
deep past with life on Lemuria,

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and life in Atlantis,
and where we are today.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.630 align:middle line:84%
How would you talk
about that in summary?

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.450 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I
was told that it's

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:27.630 align:middle line:84%
time to reveal all this
again, because we have reached

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:32.660 align:middle line:84%
a vibrational level at that
harmonic convergence of 1987

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.260 align:middle line:84%
where we reached a vibrational
level where we will never

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.390 align:middle line:90%
destroy ourselves again.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's excellent news.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
the next 100 years,

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.710 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see conflicts
slowly go down to the point

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:51.380 align:middle line:84%
where there'll be almost no
conflicts 100 years from now.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And that might be
kind of hard for--

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.170 align:middle line:84%
because everybody lives
in fear in some ways.

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.310 align:middle line:90%
But that's not going to happen.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:02.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going-- 100
years from now,

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm told that people will
look back at this time period,

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's like what we
look back at that 1917,

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.720 align:middle line:90%
'18, '19 period that was so--

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.725 align:middle line:84%
to us-- fundamental,
or basic, that they're

00:46:18.725 --> 00:46:20.540 align:middle line:84%
going to look back
at our time period,

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:23.330 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
that much progress

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:25.502 align:middle line:90%
in the next 95 to 100 years.

00:46:25.502 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I believe
that, because I

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.585 align:middle line:84%
think most of the
people on this Earth,

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:32.030 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter where you come
from, understand that war now

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:33.590 align:middle line:90%
is barbaric.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And there's no place for it.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:37.010 align:middle line:90%
There's no place for it anymore.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.550 align:middle line:90%
You can't defend it.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the beauties
of what's happened with media,

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.470 align:middle line:84%
as much as you have crazy
information and disinformation

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and such all jumbled
together out there,

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:51.650 align:middle line:84%
is there is enough that
has happened to show

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:53.930 align:middle line:90%
how wars actually occur.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:56.570 align:middle line:84%
That they only serve a
handful of people generally.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: As the industrial--

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.955 align:middle line:84%
what is it, industrial
military intelligence complex,

00:47:02.955 --> 00:47:03.830 align:middle line:90%
whatever it's called.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:09.540 align:middle line:84%
It serves this handful to
keep them in power in the ways

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.790 align:middle line:90%
that they like to be in power.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:13.440 align:middle line:84%
But that has nothing to do
with the rest of humanity.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's really irrelevant now.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:90%
War doesn't work any longer.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:19.737 align:middle line:84%
I think most people
have televisions.

00:47:19.737 --> 00:47:20.570 align:middle line:90%
They have computers.

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.090 align:middle line:84%
They have enough that they've
learned, wait a minute,

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.590 align:middle line:84%
there's some pretty
shadowy things

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.200 align:middle line:84%
going on behind every
single one of these wars.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to participate.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, the
younger generations

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.815 align:middle line:84%
are more and more savvy that
there's no place for war

00:47:34.815 --> 00:47:35.615 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:47:35.615 --> 00:47:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Hell, no, we won't go.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, in
draining our resources.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: As the old saying went.

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, in the
hippie generation, yeah.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the Vietnam War.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.900 align:middle line:90%
So no, this is good.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I can definitely see what
you're talking about,

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.910 align:middle line:90%
where war will become extinct.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and over time,
if we have clean energy,

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:55.250 align:middle line:84%
we won't have to go
through the processes

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that we are now of damaging
and polluting the planet.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So free energy coming in
is definitely good news.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, these
are good messages.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, Tom, thank you so much.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Any final things you would like
to say before we sign off here?

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:12.857 align:middle line:10%
>>MOORE: Just like to mention
that "The Gentle Way" book 1,

00:48:12.857 --> 00:48:14.690 align:middle line:10%
"The Gentle Way: A
Self-Help Guide for Those

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:17.310 align:middle line:10%
Who Believe in Angels,"
is in audio form now.

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:18.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, good.

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:21.950 align:middle line:10%
>>MOORE: And it's also
in Greek, and German,

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:25.040 align:middle line:10%
and Spanish, and in
case people would

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:29.750 align:middle line:10%
like to check it out, and check
out my "Atlantis and Lemuria:

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.260 align:middle line:10%
The Lost Continents Revealed."

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:31.520 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:33.590 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.630 align:middle line:10%
Always a fascinating
conversation, and also

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:38.540 align:middle line:10%
a reminder that things
change, but we're still here.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can go to
"The Gentle Way"

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.080 align:middle line:84%
book to learn more
about Tom's work

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.643 align:middle line:90%
and order a copy of his book.

00:48:43.643 --> 00:48:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.360 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
