that few people know--

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Robert Oppenheimer, the lead
developer of the atomic bomb,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:84%
had regrets at what he
had participated in.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's common knowledge,
but what we didn't know

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:84%
is that he and Albert
Einstein reached out

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to then-President
Truman suggesting

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that the bomb brought on
heavy ET surveillance of Earth

for colonization.

This is not well known.

00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:44.130 align:middle line:90%
This should be very well known.

it's good to be here,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.725 align:middle line:10%
and it's certainly good to have
this discussion because I think

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:10%
it's very appropriate,
especially since the film

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.265 align:middle line:10%
"Oppenheimer" came out--

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:56.065 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: --which kind of
dovetails with Jacques VallÃ©e

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:10%
in my book, "Trinity," because
we had spent a lot of time

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:10%
in New Mexico, and the shadow of
Oppenheimer is there every time

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:10%
we walked into the
Owl Bar and Cafe.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:10%
And then the houses they used
were right behind the Owl

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:10%
Bar and Cafe.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:10%
And so if you just imagine
the planning during this,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.408 align:middle line:10%
I think this is history.

00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, it's huge.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.492 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge part of history
and also because it's

00:01:25.492 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
two such renowned
and highly respected

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.455 align:middle line:84%
scientists who had very,
very high clearance talking--

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle line:90%
because they had clearance.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:84%
They knew about
our participation

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and the visitations from ETs and
craft and even back engineered

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:90%
technology, to an extent.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So they're commenting
on this in a way,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:84%
pleading with the president
to take into consideration

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
we have to find a
global way to start

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with these
visiting ET civilizations.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get to the
actual letter itself in a bit.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:90%
But first, let's set the stage.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
Oppenheimer when

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:10%
they were developing
the bomb, when

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:10%
they were out there near
Trinity at the Owl what?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Owl Bar.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Owl Bar and Cafe.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.900 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: And it's still there.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.622 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: And it's still there.

00:02:10.622 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:10%
It's been built up.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:10%
But the people that own it
are still the same people.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:10%
For us investigative
journalists,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.055 align:middle line:10%
it's easy to go and talk
to the owner and say,

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:10%
do you remember those
guys that came in here?

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:10%
And she said to me--

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:10%
she said, well, we thought
they were traveling salesmen

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:10%
because they had these--

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: They had briefcases.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.055 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: They had briefcases,
and that's what traveling

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:90%
salesmen had.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:10%
And that bar is
located at the juncture

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:10%
of the Pan-American Highway,
which was very, very traveled,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.258 align:middle line:10%
and it's like just one
street in San Antonio.

00:02:46.258 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And in fact,
they were some of the top

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:90%
physicists--

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:84%
nuclear physicists
and scientists

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
in the world gathering
out in the desert

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
preparing for this,
quote, "test," which

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.727 align:middle line:90%
we'll talk about in a moment.

00:02:57.727 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you wrote
the book "Trinity,"

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.020 align:middle line:84%
you interviewed
some of the people

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:84%
who were alive in the day, the
young boys that had witnessed

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and actually interfaced with
some of the stuff on board

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.595 align:middle line:84%
a craft that visited the area
after the Trinity explosion.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: One
month after, yeah.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.012 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And which is--

00:03:16.012 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
the timing on all of this,
this letter and everything,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
is extremely important
because it was very clear

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
that our entrance
into the atomic age

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:84%
was of dire concern
for many ET species

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.458 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Well, it would be.

00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just logical.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, here we are,
this civilization

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.960 align:middle line:10%
that seems to be
nonthreatening, and then

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:10%
all at once what we do.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.475 align:middle line:10%
And we made it clear--

00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:10%
in fact, Jacques made it
clear that was not a test.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:10%
That was an actual bomb.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that wasn't a test.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: That was no test--

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
to test about it?

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: --that--
there's no testing that.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:10%
And they learned from
that, too, though,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:10%
that if you did explode
it from the air,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:10%
it did less damage
than the ground.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:10%
So you can imagine that the
fallout was 150-mile radius,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:10%
and the actual Trinity
site that we covered

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:10%
is 13 miles away
from ground zero.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: And the actual Owl
Bar and Cafe is 4 miles away,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:10%
so you think that Oppenheimer
wouldn't know if he's lodging

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:10%
there?

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:10%
They also told me that was
the only place they could

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:10%
buy groceries and the
only place in town--

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:10%
the only watering hole in town.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:10%
And in those days, they had--

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if people remember,
but they had soda fountains.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And so the young guys
that were part of the Trinity--

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
or the Manhattan Project would
go in there to see the girls

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
because that's the only place
you met somebody in the 1940s

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:90%
and '50s--

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Over a root
beer float or something--

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.232 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: --was the
soda-- right, exactly.

00:04:48.232 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
left it uncovered

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
when the boys were there to
go see the girls at the Owl

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Bar and Cafe.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:10%
And the little kids
told me that they

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:10%
hung out there because that
was where all the action was,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:10%
at the soda fountain.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.425 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, these are
people who are now old men.

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When they
were little kids,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:90%
they were hanging out there.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: They were 9 and
7, and they were hanging out

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:84%
there, and now they're in
their 80s and one is deceased.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But when you do a
story like this--

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and I already knew
about this letter

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:84%
because I had looked at
it at least 10 years ago.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm friends with
Bob and Ryan Wood

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:90%
because I had asked them--

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I said, this letter
is extraordinary.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Is it real?

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Because it's part of
the MJ-12 documents.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.967 align:middle line:90%
But you did more work on it.

00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I mean,
I just followed up.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
You're the one that
gave me the push on it.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
You gave me the
letter, a copy of it,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
so I just followed
up with Bob Wood.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, where did
you get this information?

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So he told me what his
source was, who was--

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
their father was
highly entrenched

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.380 align:middle line:84%
at a high level in the
government at that time.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
So he was able to--

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how he was
able to take a copy of it,

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.690 align:middle line:90%
but he did, right?

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Because they made
everything in carbon copies.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The carbon-- yeah.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, not only that.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:90%
That's typewritten, so--

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it was Timothy
Cooper was the man that gave

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Bob Wood--

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
explain who Bob Wood is
so everyone understands,

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.598 align:middle line:90%
it has some context.

00:06:13.598 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, Bob Wood
worked for McDonnell Douglas,

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:90%
and I love the man.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:90%
He's in his 90s now.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:10%
But he's such a treasure
trove of real history

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:10%
because he and Ryan
not only worked

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:10%
with the MJ-12 documents--
they did so much UFO research.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.942 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, he's
famous in the field.

00:06:31.942 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: He's famous.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he's
a credible player.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: And he is.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, he worked for--

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.195 align:middle line:90%
and he's a scientist.

00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:10%
He worked for McDonnell Douglas.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is
that with Bob, they

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:10%
were able to put together
the history of this

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:10%
because this is not
2023, just the government

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:10%
releasing what it--

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we're going
back to 1945 here.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.105 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, this
is serious stuff.

00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: So if you do your
homework you realize that these

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
documents are going around, that
with the Freedom of Information

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Act we have even more documents.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.210 align:middle line:10%
And of course I have
my own archive--

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right, huge.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: --my own
archive of documents.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.158 align:middle line:10%
And I always kid around,
but I have 300 books,

00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:10%
and I've read all
my colleagues work.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, how could I
have put this together?

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:10%
One of the things I saw in
that document right off the bat

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.825 align:middle line:10%
was the way it was written.

00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is really--

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
we'll get to this
in just a moment.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:90%
So we're setting the stage here.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.767 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we've
had the, quote, "test,"

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:34.975 align:middle line:90%
in other words, the bombing--

00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: The actual bombing.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --at Trinity, which
had huge fallout and health

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:84%
consequences for
little Remy, Baucus,

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and the other people
that were living there.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:84%
The native population
wasn't even warned.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:90%
And here you have--

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ignorance--
it was ignorance.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't
know in the day.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
When you see the
film "Oppenheimer,"

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
which was so beautifully
done, and they're

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
getting ready for
the blast, people

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:84%
are putting grease
paint on their face

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and sitting in
lawn chairs [LAUGH]

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
waiting to watch
this detonation.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: They didn't know,
but what was very bad--

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:10%
and I think there's a lawsuit
or something around it--

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.417 align:middle line:10%
is that the repercussions
were terrible.

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Cancers--

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Cancers.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --blown-out
eardrums, eyesight-- blindness.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: In fact, Jose
Padilla's mother at 5

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:10%
o'clock in the morning is
packing lunch for his father,

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:10%
who's going to work.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:10%
And she opens the
door, and she says

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.644 align:middle line:10%
it was like the light
of a thousand suns.

00:08:32.644 --> 00:08:33.658 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: I can imagine the
sun being a thousand times more.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:10%
But she was blinded in one eye.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.309 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: And as a result--

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:41.735 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But they didn't warn
any of the native population--

00:08:41.735 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: No, they couldn't.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --that this
was going to happen.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Well, they couldn't.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how you
work around this.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:10%
I was looking at all the
ways they could have done it.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.227 align:middle line:10%
But no, later on
they all gathered,

00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:10%
and they said that
they had blown up--

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.727 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Stay indoors
and under your covers.

00:08:54.727 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:10%
Don't look outside, anything.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.148 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: They said they
blew up an ammunition dump.

00:08:58.148 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:90%
That was the official--

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: --the
official-official--

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.133 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it
had repercussions,

00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and it was filmed, and
it was also photographed.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get to
a very unusual photograph

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:15.268 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit because it's all
tying back to the same subject.

00:09:15.268 --> 00:09:19.020 align:middle line:10%
This development in humanity,
using this technology,

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.480 align:middle line:10%
it did bring great
surveillance and great concern

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:10%
that exists to this day.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:10%
We've had intervention
through the years, it appears,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:10%
from ETs-- we're going to talk
about one of them in a little

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:10%
bit--

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.290 align:middle line:10%
to stop us from ever conducting
this kind of experiment

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:10%
on Earth again because
of the damaging effects

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:10%
not only to Earth but even
to the other dimensions

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:10%
surrounding Earth--

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Other dimensions,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.955 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: --that
ripple out into--

00:09:41.955 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Exactly.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --the domain
of other planets.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:90%
We don't think about that.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: If people do their
history homework on this,

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:10%
the whole Space
Brother movement,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:10%
all the messages from
the so-called Venusians,

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:10%
and all the messages
were, stop the nuclear.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:10%
Stop the nuclear.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.908 align:middle line:10%
You're going to
destroy yourselves.

00:09:58.908 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:10%
It was mainly nuclear.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Today we have climate
change and other things.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: But in those
days, it was about,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:10%
you people have opened
a Pandora's box,

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:10%
so would you please make
that the one and only?

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: But the problem with
that is then you have an arms

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:84%
race, and then we're
playing a chess game.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that
you can win is stalemate.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sadly, because of the
ego structure of human beings.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: There's
no way of winning a--

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.473 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: --nuclear war--

00:10:26.473 --> 00:10:27.273 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:10:27.273 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: --against each other.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:10%
You can checkmate.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can checkmate--

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:90%
I have them.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:90%
You have them.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:90%
I have them.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.493 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is where
we've been for 70 years.

00:10:35.493 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: And today, in 2023,
we need to look at what this

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:10%
means.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We do.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:90%
So the blast happened.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Then we did it for real, OK,
the atomic bomb over Hiroshima,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
hydrogen bomb over
Nagasaki-- competing forces

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
in the world of science
wanting to show their prowess.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Great rewards were given.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:90%
But behind the scenes--

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Oppenheimer, there's that
very famous clip from him

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that states that he
has become a destroyer.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:90%
I am become the destroyer.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Of worlds.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of worlds--
from the Bhagavad Gita.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.785 align:middle line:10%
It was a quote from the
excerpt from the Bhagavad Gita.

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Right.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But nonetheless,
that's how he felt inside his

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:90%
own soul on this.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But the part extending
from that now, what

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:84%
happens in the interim, from
the time of Hiroshima-Nagasaki

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.910 align:middle line:84%
until the time they issued
this letter to Truman?

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about August 6--

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:90%
August of 1945 to June of 1947.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.970 align:middle line:84%
What happens in the interim
regarding visitations

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, et cetera?

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Well, first
of all, at that time--

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:10%
and I have to talk about
Trinity in this-- they didn't--

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm guessing they brought
the craft to Los Alamos.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:10%
And since there is no
Blue Book, and there's

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:10%
no Air Force and
Army separately--

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:10%
because they joined later on.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the Army Air Force
to clean that up--

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:90%
they weren't sure what they had.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you get Kenneth
Arnold, who's in 1947.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:84%
That gets even
trickier because he's

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
the one that coined the
phrase "flying saucer."

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
Roswell in July of 1947.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:10%
So 1947 has become the
year that supposedly marks

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:10%
the beginning of the UFO era.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Also the
intelligence era--

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
there was an intelligence
gathering operation.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It changed names from one
thing to another at that time.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:90%
What was it, again?

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: You mean the CIA?

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah-- yeah.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, Colonel Corso
talked about that in his book,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.372 align:middle line:10%
the intelligence--

00:12:46.372 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: A lot of the
intelligence gathering really

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:10%
was centered around what
happened as a result

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:10%
of the atomic explosions.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.482 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And ET--

00:12:55.482 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Visitations.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.482 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --visitations.

00:12:57.482 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Well,
the ET visitations,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't take a rocket
scientist to figure out that

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:10%
if we are being visited,
we have caused attention

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:10%
in the universe.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.960 align:middle line:10%
And then if you start
following the UFOs

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:10%
over nuclear facilities and look
at the Malmstrom Air Force Base

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:10%
1969 event--

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:10%
and it was two
events, Oscar and Echo

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:10%
events where they shut down the
missiles one by one by one--

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.420 align:middle line:10%
then somebody is
interested in the--

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.502 align:middle line:10%
someone is interested in our
ability to destroy ourselves.

00:13:29.502 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
make comments around

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that because some people look
at that as an act of war,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.305 align:middle line:84%
and some people look at
that as an act of peace.

00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I see it
as an act of peace.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:84%
If we're not smart enough
to disinvolve ourselves

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:90%
with that, at least someone is.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So I don't mind a
little helping hand

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.470 align:middle line:84%
if it's going to keep us
from blowing each other up.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:10%
Personally, I'm OK with that.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: I agree, but, see--

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But let's talk
about Malmstrom for a moment

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:10%
for people that don't
know about that event.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Salas talks
about this a great deal.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
happened that day

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:84%
because it scared the
poo out of everybody.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: In Montana, I
interviewed Robert Salas.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:10%
He basically said he was in
a bunker under the facility,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.848 align:middle line:10%
and there were 10
missiles pointed--

00:14:10.848 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:10%
and we were pointing--
it was the Cold War,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:10%
so we're pointing
missiles at Russia,

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:10%
and Russia is pointing
missiles at us.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.322 align:middle line:10%
And you hope
there's no mistakes.

00:14:19.322 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:10%
So all at once, this big red
fireball came across the area.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.590 align:middle line:10%
And he said everybody that
was on the surface, all

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.200 align:middle line:10%
the military guys that were on
the surface with the rifles,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:10%
they just freaked
themselves out because it

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:10%
was over the missile silos,
the nuclear missile silos.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, this big
thing was hovering there.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's scared.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.957 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: And then everything
went down one at a time.

00:14:47.957 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Each
missile was shut down.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, one at a time,
and then within a week they

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:90%
were back up.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.983 align:middle line:10%
So this is why it's
not an act of war.

00:14:54.983 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:10%
If they wanted to, they would
have destroyed the missiles.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:10%
However, what was interesting--

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:10%
I've asked Robert
in the later years.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:10%
I said, did you get any message?

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:08.912 align:middle line:84%
And he said in my head, they
said, "We can shut you down."

00:15:08.912 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I said you heard
that in your head?

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:10%
And of course,
Robert did a lot of--

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:10%
this is what I don't understand.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:10%
He did a lot of disclosure.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was very,
very interesting

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.080 align:middle line:84%
because he was at the citizen
hearing and talked about this.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.723 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: He was in Washington.

00:15:26.723 --> 00:15:28.098 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I
remember that, yeah.

00:15:28.098 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:84%
He was at the original
disclosure in DC.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, so
we've had disclosure.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That would
have been a long time ago.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.925 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: It
happened a while ago--

00:15:34.925 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: --in the 2000s.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that was real.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.520 align:middle line:10%
That wasn't just a simple thing.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So looking at this
and then the fact

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that they activated
the codes in Russia,

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:90%
and that must have been scary.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And they have
also appeared over nuclear

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:90%
facilities.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: I interviewed
Jean-Charles Duboc,

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:10%
who's a French pilot
with Air France.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:10%
In Europe, I interviewed
him, and he told me that

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:10%
in his Air France airplane that
all the people saw the UFO.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:10%
And I said where was it?

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:10%
And he said it was over
a nuclear facility.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.762 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Because I don't
think it's just hanging out.

00:16:14.762 --> 00:16:15.562 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:15.562 --> 00:16:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And so if you start
doing where a lot of these

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:84%
sites-- even Stephenville,
there's a nuclear facility

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:90%
in Texas.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: So if you
start putting together,

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.143 align:middle line:10%
connecting the dots--

00:16:25.143 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You see they hang
out around nuclear facilities

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:10%
and military bases where
development's going on.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Right, so I mean,
what's surprising about this?

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, there shouldn't
be anything surprising about it

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.563 align:middle line:84%
except for people who
still think we're the only

00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
intelligent--
quote, "intelligent"

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:90%
species in the universe.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we need to
argue that one too much,

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:84%
but so the point being
that they have come,

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and there have been
also stories that there

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
were some kind of errant shots
fired across the bow that

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:90%
were essentially neutralized.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we have that one
out of Vandenberg Air Force

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Base that shot to the moon.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Right.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that
was captured on film.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Right.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I've seen the film.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I saw that originally
at disclosure.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.887 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: I know Robert
Hastings did a lot on that.

00:17:08.887 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He did, but wasn't
that film the one that was

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:84%
actually used in
"Project Blue Book"

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
on the History Channel in the
slightly fictionalized version

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:90%
of all this?

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:90%
They showed that.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:10%
I think that was
the original film.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Well, the
original film is out there.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: And the thing
is that there, again,

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:10%
it's in your interpretation.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.660 align:middle line:10%
So the military are
looking at it as hostile.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And I'm
saying, yay, good for you.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:90%
They had a warhead on it.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.367 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to shoot
a warhead to the moon.

00:17:36.367 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.158 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's hostile--
no, that's hostile.

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:90%
That's us.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.092 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: No, that's us.

00:17:41.092 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:10%
And then Project Horizon and
the day after Roswell, Colonel

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:10%
Corso talks about the testing
of an atom bomb on the moon.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going, are we crazy?

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what happened was
I think it was either 14,000

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.230 align:middle line:84%
or 16,000 miles an hour, they
could see after they shot this

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
off and everybody's at
command central watching,

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:90%
and it's like, what?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.520 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And some object
comes up keeping pace

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.710 align:middle line:84%
with the missile, which
was at that speed by then,

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and it shows it going around
it-- boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.120 align:middle line:90%
[WISP] Gone.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Neutralized.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It never made its
destination to the moon.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: But one of the things
that I wonder about is these

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:10%
are obvious messages, Regina.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:10%
OK, so-- and we're not
listening, obviously,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.660 align:middle line:10%
because look where we are today.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:10%
Are they ever going
to let one go through,

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:10%
just to teach us a lesson?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: [SIGH]

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: I'm wondering about
this just on a personal level

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:10%
because we're talking
about some of the cases,

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:10%
but there's a lot more that
we're not talking about here

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.115 align:middle line:10%
of warnings about
what we're doing.

00:18:40.115 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This
stuff is serious,

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and I want to bring
it back to you.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we will
eventually get to what

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:50.316 align:middle line:84%
Einstein and Oppenheimer
wrote here, but there was--

00:18:50.316 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:90%
this was really scary stuff.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:90%
You were in Rome.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm referring to
the-- what was he--

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Guy Andronik?

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Guy Andronik--

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to
pronounce his name.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:84%
What happened with you regarding
documents on the H-bomb?

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.293 align:middle line:84%
OK, tell us what
happened to you.

00:19:05.293 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Well, first of all,
if you remember Oppenheimer

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.230 align:middle line:10%
for the people, Teller was
arguing with Oppenheimer that

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:10%
the bomb wasn't strong enough,
so he was going to go off

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:10%
and do the H-bomb--

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: --the
thermonuclear bomb.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:10%
And so what happened is when
I happened to be in Italy--

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.410 align:middle line:10%
and I lived there
from '94 to 2007--

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:10%
I saw one of the witnesses
at our local UFO meeting,

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:10%
Guy Andronik, who was on
the island of Fangataufa

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:10%
in the Pacific.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:84%
He was on the island
of Fangataufa,

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and he was part of H-bomb
tests, which are much more

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:90%
powerful than the atomic bomb.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.443 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this stuff's
being shot off on these tiny

00:19:41.443 --> 00:19:42.500 align:middle line:90%
islands and in the ocean.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: In the ocean.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:43.830 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Our oceans.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.747 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Our oceans.

00:19:44.747 --> 00:19:47.190 align:middle line:10%
And he came-- he
was testifying--

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:10%
and he's very brave--

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:10%
that he was present
on two occasions

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:10%
because he said France did 800
H-bomb tests in the Pacific.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going,
that's just France.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:10%
How many did we do?

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:10%
And India I know did a few.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:10%
And he said there were 3 feet
of dead fish on the runway

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:10%
every time they'd do
it, and they killed

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:10%
the coral until Greenpeace
came along with their boats

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:10%
and stopped--

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.600 align:middle line:10%
you know, and protested that.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:10%
He said on two occasions,
UFOs flew over the runways--

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:10%
three green balls of light.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:10%
He said he jumped on an airplane
with the other military people.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:10%
They followed them, and all
the equipment on the airplane

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:10%
froze.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were
afraid for a minute,

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:84%
but when the UFOs
went over the horizon,

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:84%
they regained their power
and were able to land.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:10%
Now, if these UFOs
that are flying over

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:10%
the H-bomb testing are
giving us a message,

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.913 align:middle line:10%
and they're not
shooting us and saying,

00:20:49.913 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:10%
what are you doing
to your oceans,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:10%
and are you are
you people crazy?

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.150 align:middle line:10%
Then people need to look at
that because he protested.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:10%
He came up because he had a
daughter that was deformed,

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:10%
and he had a lawsuit.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.330 align:middle line:10%
And so I got him to
come to my house.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:10%
And I said, Guy, you
need to tell the world.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:10%
This is H-bomb, and you were
present, and UFOs flew over,

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:10%
and they didn't do anything.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:10%
On two occasions, you saw them.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're
having some damage to DNA

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:17.973 align:middle line:90%
in your family.

00:21:17.973 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Oh, absolutely--
that's why he was angry.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:90%
That's why he was angry.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:10%
So what happened was
while I was filming him--

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:10%
and I was a little
nervous at the time,

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:10%
so I called a friend of mine
who worked for customs agents

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:10%
in Italy.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:10%
And he came to--

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:10%
he was like my Mulder,
and I was like the Scully.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:10%
And then we finished
the taping, and then we

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:10%
went to have pizza in a
restaurant with his wife--

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.700 align:middle line:10%
with Guy's wife.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:10%
We came back.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:10%
They had gone home.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:10%
I saw the door of
my apartment open.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:54.040 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the guy,
Antonello that worked with me

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.697 align:middle line:10%
had a gun because he was a
policeman for the customs.

00:21:57.697 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And he pulled out the gun.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And he says, is somebody
in your apartment?

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if he's
going to shoot somebody,

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.650 align:middle line:84%
let me knock on all the
doors because we're not just

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.140 align:middle line:90%
doing it at random.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:90%
My door is open.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.380 align:middle line:10%
And I knocked on the
doors and said, look,

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:10%
I've been broken into.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:10%
Please be witness
to what happens.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:10%
They had jumped over the
balconies in my apartment.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: I was on
the seventh floor.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:90%
That's how they got in.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: They
left the door open,

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:90%
but they took the film footage.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:10%
They took his computer,
my computer, all--

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:10%
I have three digital
cameras at the time,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.660 align:middle line:10%
but they also took
my mother's fur coat,

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:10%
jewelry, and so forth.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:10%
It was 20,000 euros worth
of material that they stole.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And somebody didn't
want us to film that--

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Talking about this.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: --and
this is in Rome--

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and talk about it because if
you really sit down and look at,

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:90%
this is darn serious.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Was there
another instance, too,

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:84%
as I recall where there was
some kind of blast in front

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:90%
of your apartment?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Oh, when I was
doing the Michael Wolf case,

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:10%
I had my car bombs go off in
front of my apartment on two

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:10%
separate occasions.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:10%
And he worked-- the Michael Wolf
case is extremely interesting.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:10%
He was a remote viewer
with a Stubblebine group,

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:10%
had done the Achille Lauro case,
and a lot of the Red Brigade

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.120 align:middle line:10%
cases he had remote viewed.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:10%
And I had been one of
the only journalists that

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:10%
covered that case.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.620 align:middle line:10%
But evidently, when
you're doing something

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:29.390 align:middle line:10%
that disrupts the
status quo, especially

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:10%
with intelligence people--

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.730 align:middle line:10%
Michael had worked for the
CIA and had been an agent.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:10%
And when you're
working with this--

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:10%
and it was very important
for me to go to the source,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.200 align:middle line:10%
like a Guy Andronik
that worked with H-bomb.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.530 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: But I
didn't realize--

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.110 align:middle line:10%
I think I didn't realize
until I saw the movie

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:10%
"Oppenheimer" that the
mentality here is, yeah,

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.180 align:middle line:10%
we made an A-bomb.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:10%
Let's make something stronger.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: So now
where are we today?

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
was a competition.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, but
where are we today?

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:90%
What's stronger than the H-bomb?

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.570 align:middle line:10%
Like, is this thinking
still on Earth?

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:06.372 align:middle line:90%
There's the H-bomb.

00:24:06.372 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Like, what else are we doing?

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, the people
in certain countries still

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.810 align:middle line:90%
threaten to go nuclear.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is such
a worn-out old story

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:middle line:84%
that should have
been put to rest

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
the day of the original
blasts in 1945.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We should have never, ever
considered this technology

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:26.750 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But you still have
all of these silos,

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:90%
all of these capabilities.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Drones can drop them,
for heaven's sakes.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:10%
You know--

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, we actually
what I call shot ourselves

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:10%
in the foot because there's
no getting off this.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if people start--

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:10%
if everybody's
having a competition

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:10%
for nuclear or other
exotic weapons,

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:10%
then how do we get off
this race, this arms race

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:10%
or whatever?

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But the thinking
of the scientists

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:84%
in that film, the sitting
down and dialoguing

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that they did really interested
me because I had covered--

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Me too, yeah.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: --I had
covered the Oppenheimer--

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and Einstein was
in the film, too.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was quite
prominent as an advisor

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.268 align:middle line:90%
and friend to Oppenheimer.

00:25:13.268 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Absolutely,
at Princeton--

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.563 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: You have to remember.

00:25:16.563 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And so what secret stuff is
going on that's dangerous?

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:10%
And don't we look at
the repercussions?

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't think Oppenheimer
was really happy

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:30.710 align:middle line:10%
that it was tested on-- and it
wasn't tested-- on two cities.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:10%
He thought one would
have been enough.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this kind of
thinking is crazy.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, so he
and Albert were concerned.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And so here we are.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is about roughly
a month before Roswell, OK?

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And you've done a tremendous
amount of research.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:84%
You did a companion to
"Day after Roswell,"

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Philip Corso's book, right?

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.635 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, actually, it
was his original manuscript.

00:25:55.635 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Dawning of a New Age."

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.093 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: "The Dawning
of a New Age," yeah.

00:25:59.093 --> 00:26:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: --because "The Day
after Roswell" is co-written.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:10%
It's got a co-author.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:10%
And so when he came
to Italy, Corso

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:10%
wanted the original manuscript
that we would print.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:10%
And people can have
access to that.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and I highly
recommend that people read both

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:90%
of those books.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I found them both
fascinating in terms

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
of what kind of technology was
seeded, at least in America.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
We also had Germany
and other places

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:84%
around the planet where
this technology was

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:90%
seeded through crashes.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So here it is a month
before the Roswell crash

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:84%
but well after the
events of World War II.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:90%
And so this letter is written.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.750 align:middle line:84%
It says "top secret"
across the top.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:84%
The name of the document
is called "Relationships

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:84%
with inhabitants of
celestrial bodies"--

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:90%
they call them celestrial.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.158 align:middle line:84%
And you go through,
and they set up

00:26:57.158 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:90%
why they're writing the letter.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But there's much in
this that's fascinating.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Can people find it on your site?

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Where do they find it?

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:90%
They have to go to Bob Wood.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: No, MJ-12--

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: MJ-12.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Ryan
Wood's site has it,

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:10%
but if they want to email me,
I'll be glad to give it to them

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:10%
because I think it puts it
in a context of history.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:10%
And the fact that it's written
in July before Roswell--

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:10%
I mean in June--

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:20.470 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: June.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.960 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: --in June before
Roswell means what it means,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:10%
is there were other
crashes before that.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and
you're aware of those.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And they're
having a problem.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You study them.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And they're having
a problem trying to decide what

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this was
one of the suggestions.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Another possibility-- they've
gone through some possibilities

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
if peaceful cooperation
isn't an issue.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.350 align:middle line:84%
"Another possibility may exist
that a species of Homo sapiens

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:84%
might have
established themselves

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:84%
as an independent nation
on another celestrial body

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.300 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system
and evolved culturally

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.400 align:middle line:90%
independently from ours.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this possibility
depends on many circumstances

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.210 align:middle line:84%
whose conditions
cannot yet be foreseen.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.410 align:middle line:84%
However, we can make a study on
the basis of which such a thing

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:90%
might have occurred."

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So looking at some evolved
humans from elsewhere

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:90%
that come back here--

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Come back
and say, don't do this.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --and are concerned.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Don't do this.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Don't do this.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:18.053 align:middle line:90%
What are you people doing?

00:28:18.053 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:90%
It's going to get worse.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:10%
And OK, now we continue down
page 2 a little further,

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:10%
and the top of this
part says, "Now we

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:10%
come to the problem
of determining

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:10%
what to do if the inhabitants
of celestrial bodies

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.550 align:middle line:10%
or extraterrestrial
biological entities

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:10%
desire to settle here."

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.832 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: [LAUGH]
That's a problem.

00:28:38.832 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
they're saying, hey,

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:90%
we brought this on ourselves.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
We drew this
attention to ourselves

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:84%
by creating this destructive,
reckless technology.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Now we're having to live with
it, so let's make a plan.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Here it says, "A superior
form of colonizing

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.610 align:middle line:84%
will have to be conceived that
could be a kind of tutelage,

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.605 align:middle line:84%
possibly through the tacit
approval of the United

00:29:01.605 --> 00:29:02.405 align:middle line:90%
Nations"--

00:29:02.405 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Nations.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.830 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:84%
"But would the United
Nations legally

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.440 align:middle line:84%
have the right of allowing
such tutelage over us

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.070 align:middle line:90%
in such a fashion?"

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So here they're talking
about overt colonization

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of wiser species, and how do we
welcome them, learn from them,

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and live alongside them
until we can get our

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.633 align:middle line:90%
you know what together.

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, yeah, these
are two scientists, remember,

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:90%
that are--

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
Oppenheimer and Einstein--

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: And Einstein, yeah.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --writing
to President Truman.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.022 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: These are two
scientists who are using

00:29:36.022 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:90%
logic-- thank God.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, OK, well,
we got to deal with this.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:10%
And then part of
that also says we

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.180 align:middle line:10%
have to create another United
Nations called a Supra--

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.180 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: A Supra
United Nations.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm looking at the
United Nations today,

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:51.830 align:middle line:10%
and I'm looking--

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:52.860 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: How they
would handle this?

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.027 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: How they handle--

00:29:54.027 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
how do they handle what's
happening right now?

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.605 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah-- not well.

00:29:57.605 --> 00:29:59.938 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: And then we're
going to have ETs coming down,

00:29:59.938 --> 00:30:01.580 align:middle line:10%
and then they have
to handle that, too?

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:10%
And there is no structure or a
way of dealing with this that--

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.623 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you could create a
Supra United Nations, but--

00:30:11.623 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: We don't have
the maturity to even choose

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.870 align:middle line:10%
the players.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:17.355 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: And not only that--
we just had disclosure with

00:30:17.355 --> 00:30:18.230 align:middle line:10%
"The New York Times."

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:10%
It just came out
that this is real.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, it's all been
science fiction up until now.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.380 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So here we have these--
so they're really, truly,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:84%
earnestly thinking they have
enough clout, enough position

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:84%
that it will make it
before President Truman.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.580 align:middle line:10%
So what happens then?

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.200 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Well, they're very
logical about delineating all

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:10%
the problems.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.610 align:middle line:10%
And they actually
say, this came out

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:10%
of our testing of
the atomic bomb.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.627 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes, they
were very clear about it.

00:30:44.627 --> 00:30:46.730 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: They're very
clear that they were being

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:10%
surveilled.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And there are
other photos of there.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
they had clearance.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:90%
They knew this.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, and
they have other photos.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:10%
Regina, there's photos out
there of ships over that area

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.460 align:middle line:10%
right around this time,
apart from the one

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to show.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:08.390 align:middle line:10%
But this was concerning
them because they were

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:10%
looking at it as inclusive.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.510 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same
problem we have

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.190 align:middle line:10%
today with the
Congressional hearings

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.050 align:middle line:10%
because they're looking at--

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:10%
how are they looking at it,
as a national security issue?

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Do we have to develop exotic
weapons to go after them?

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's more
money, more weapons.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Or all that stuff.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.910 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: So the problem
that we're having today with

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.930 align:middle line:10%
the discussions relate to
the problem that Einstein

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.368 align:middle line:10%
and Oppenheimer are talking
about in this letter in 1947.

00:31:35.368 --> 00:31:37.910 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Let's go to the photo
you just mentioned because I

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.368 align:middle line:10%
meant to go to it
a little bit ago.

00:31:39.368 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:10%
This is very interesting.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:10%
Who was this photo--

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:10%
who took this series of photos?

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.157 align:middle line:10%
Because I understand there
were several cameras--

00:31:49.157 --> 00:31:50.490 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Right, seven cameras.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.365 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And this
only came up on one--

00:31:52.365 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: One.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: --of the cameras.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Right.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.060 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And first of all,
it's a very different kind

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.930 align:middle line:10%
of photography that's almost
photographing in nanoseconds.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Exactly.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's why they
brought it in for this blast,

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:84%
to see nanosecond by
nanosecond how it was building.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.550 align:middle line:10%
And so I don't know how
many frames this was in,

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:18.300 align:middle line:10%
but you see here on the lower
left, there is this kind of--

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.692 align:middle line:10%
it looks like Bell Rock
in Sedona, actually.

00:32:20.692 --> 00:32:21.900 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: It's a bell craft.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.108 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's a bell craft.

00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:26.335 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: It's very much like
the Adamski craft with the--

00:32:26.335 --> 00:32:28.710 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That was visiting
regularly, speaking of this.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: --in 1953 because
that was when he was cautioned

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.200 align:middle line:10%
by Orthon to stop the nuclear
and to be an ambassador and go

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.320 align:middle line:10%
to the kings and queens and
everybody and say, stop this.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.640 align:middle line:10%
But this looks like the
Adamski craft, the bell craft.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's just
sitting there and--

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.462 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Watching
the atomic blast.

00:32:48.462 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: --the atomic
blast, which is a little part

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:10%
on the bottom, but all of the
repercussions or what happened

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.130 align:middle line:10%
in the atmosphere
is that big circle.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it was just--

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.080 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: So it's huge.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.755 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: --it's shocking.

00:32:59.755 --> 00:33:00.390 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, it's huge.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:01.590 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:10%
I have another
document that tells

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.610 align:middle line:10%
about the name of
that kind of camera,

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:08.500 align:middle line:10%
which I don't have on me
right now, but people can--

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.750 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: It's a real camera.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.650 align:middle line:10%
It's a real photo.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:10%
And it comes out of Europe.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.120 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.920 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: And it
came to the offices--

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.170 align:middle line:10%
and I know who sent it to
because I know the researchers

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:10%
in Europe that found it.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:10%
And they did incredible
research on the atomic--

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.460 align:middle line:10%
maybe because of the
movie or so forth.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And it came out of the
offices of Jaime Maussan

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.180 align:middle line:90%
when I was down there.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.390 align:middle line:10%
And he said, you want
to see this picture that

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.540 align:middle line:10%
came from these people that
I know very well in Europe?

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's one of seven
cameras that were on the--

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's very obvious that
it's a bell-shaped craft that's

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.430 align:middle line:90%
sitting there watching.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and it's
not in any of the other--

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.535 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: No, it's not
in any of the other--

00:33:48.535 --> 00:33:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Shots.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: --shots.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It just was there-- it
blinked in and blinked out.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:53.893 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Right, exactly.

00:33:53.893 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's
just we're assuming.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:90%
We're making an assumption.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.680 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of exactly
what we're talking about.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.300 align:middle line:84%
They're very
concerned, and they're

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.970 align:middle line:90%
watching this blast at Trinity.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yes, and
I think whoever--

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and there's a website
around these cameras--

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.679 align:middle line:84%
whoever was looking
at this image

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
must have had some kind of
discussion apart from the fact

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that there are
other photos of UFOs

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.108 align:middle line:84%
over the blast that Einstein
and Oppenheimer knew about.

00:34:20.108 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, they had
that kind of clearance.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:22.690 align:middle line:90%
They would have known.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:23.679 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah,
they would know.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, of course they knew.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:10%
They knew everything that
happened in that area.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:10%
And if Trinity happened,
it happened one month later

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:10%
when some of the Manhattan--

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:34.150 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's like 4 miles away
from the Owl Bar and Cafe.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.120 align:middle line:90%
How could Oppenheimer not know?

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, so we
have this bit of evidence

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that's obscure and interesting,
and if people contact you,

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.110 align:middle line:90%
you can give them--

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:47.409 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Oh, yeah,

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.449 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --the documents,
the name of the photographer,

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:50.160 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now we get back
to this document that goes

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.340 align:middle line:90%
on and on.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It's six pages of all
these different scenarios

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:84%
about humanity
ultimately is probably

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:02.470 align:middle line:84%
going to need to have relations
with extraterrestrials

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.855 align:middle line:90%
in an open, collaborative way.

00:35:04.855 --> 00:35:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Eventually, yes.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Eventually, and
we would be the students.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.620 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Well, that's
how they phrased it, yeah.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.340 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes, and
so here it says,

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.710 align:middle line:10%
"Myself and general
Marshall have read this,

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.590 align:middle line:10%
and I must admit
there is some logic.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.640 align:middle line:10%
But I hardly think the
president will consider it

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:10%
for the obvious reasons.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.490 align:middle line:10%
I understand Oppenheimer
approached Marshall

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:33.550 align:middle line:10%
while they attended"-- it's
hard to read, something at--

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.860 align:middle line:10%
"As I understand it,
Marshall rebuffed

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.710 align:middle line:10%
the idea of Oppenheimer
discussing this

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:10%
with the president."

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:40.750 align:middle line:90%
OK--

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:43.345 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: It's signed
by Vannevar Bush.

00:35:43.345 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, you can
understand why-- now,

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:90%
think about this.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:47.830 align:middle line:90%
So what follows, OK?

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.990 align:middle line:90%
So the next president we have--

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.168 align:middle line:90%
right-- is Eisenhower.

00:35:51.168 --> 00:35:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Is Eisenhower.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And who is warning
of the military-industrial--

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:54.580 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Industrial complex.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --complex.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:00.670 align:middle line:84%
This is military, and military
is saying, what a stupid idea.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:84%
We need to stay in competition
and keep developing our warring

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.850 align:middle line:84%
methods and
technologies, and it's

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:84%
keeping the military-industrial
complex going.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Comments on that because
by rejecting this-- now,

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.100 align:middle line:84%
who knows what Truman
would have said?

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, they
didn't even let him see it.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: No, they
didn't let him see it.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:10%
But it's very hard for
even the military, anybody

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.320 align:middle line:10%
to wrap their mind around it.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.320 align:middle line:10%
Right now, even with what
we've got as disclosure,

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.530 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about Tic Tacs,
and we're talking about craft.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has opened the door--

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.500 align:middle line:84%
except now, during the
hearings-- about what's inside

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.790 align:middle line:90%
or who's inside.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:84%
It's easier for them to talk
about the actual machinery

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and everything than
what is inside.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And whether it'd be an
artificial intelligence,

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.530 align:middle line:84%
a drone, or some kind of
being from another planet--

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:53.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's all the above.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It's-- we don't touch that.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.890 align:middle line:84%
It's funny that Oppenheimer
and Einstein touched that--

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They were
philosophers, though.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.390 align:middle line:90%
These men--

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: They touched that.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.285 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --had
deeply philosophical--

00:37:04.285 --> 00:37:07.310 align:middle line:84%
they were scientists with deeply
philosophical minds and were

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.670 align:middle line:84%
concerned with the philosophical
implications for the future

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:11.820 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it was very intelligently
and thoughtfully written

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.270 align:middle line:84%
because these are
the kind of people

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:90%
we need to be listening to--

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:84%
philosophers that can
see the repercussions,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.150 align:middle line:90%
extension of our actions.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, they're
physicists and scientists.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.350 align:middle line:90%
They're not military guys.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're
not military guys.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: No.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.705 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So now we go on.

00:37:29.705 --> 00:37:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Truman's out, right,
and Eisenhower's in.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Now Eisenhower is on his way
out, saying, holy cow, people.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Beware of the
military-industrial complex

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.030 align:middle line:84%
because they're
running the whole show.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: But I also think
that Eisenhower had a meeting

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:45.750 align:middle line:90%
at Holloman.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I do--

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, talk about
this because I know.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: I interviewed--
well, my book--

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Talk about--

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.947 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS:
--"Connecting the Dots"

00:37:51.947 --> 00:37:58.970 align:middle line:84%
has the exact testimony of
Kirkland, who was there.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And he--

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Say where.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to create
a frame around this.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.875 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: He was at
Holloman Air Force Base.

00:38:03.875 --> 00:38:04.880 align:middle line:90%
He was called in.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.480 align:middle line:10%
He said that Eisenhower--

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.700 align:middle line:10%
evidently he
disappeared, and they

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.910 align:middle line:10%
said he had gone to a dentist
to take care of his teeth.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you watch the
Emenegger movie, "UFOs--

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Past, Present, and
Future," Robert Emenegger

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.780 align:middle line:84%
said that-- this
is a long story--

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that they were promised footage
to do a disclosure documentary.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:37.310 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen the
documentary, and I saw it

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:39.870 align:middle line:84%
when it had the
title "It Has Begun."

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:10%
And in the documentary,
there's Rod Serling

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:10%
with Jacques VallÃ©e,
Burgess Meredith,

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.720 align:middle line:10%
and they're talking about
a hypothetical meeting

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:10%
of Eisenhower with these beings.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:59.420 align:middle line:10%
But they have an 8-second piece
of film that's real of a craft

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.300 align:middle line:10%
coming down at Holloman,
which is in New Mexico.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And was Eisenhower
said to have been there at that

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:90%
moment?

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yes, and Kirkland
told me he was there,

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that they had been pulled
into the cafeteria--

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which considering
everything that would be going

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.430 align:middle line:84%
on, of course, that would
not be out of the question--

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.610 align:middle line:84%
for other species to want to
connect with the more powerful

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:18.710 align:middle line:90%
people in the world.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's say give them
the benefit of the doubt.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:22.670 align:middle line:90%
What if he had met with them?

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.980 align:middle line:84%
What was this speech
that has become

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:29.210 align:middle line:84%
so famous about beware of the
military-industrial complex?

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, when you
have a crash of any kind,

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.490 align:middle line:84%
you have technology, and
you're not going to throw it

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:35.290 align:middle line:90%
in the trash.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:84%
You're going to try to figure
out how you can copy it or back

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.380 align:middle line:90%
engineer it and so forth.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: "The Day after
Roswell," Corso's book, yeah.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.662 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, I
mean it's logical.

00:39:42.662 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, Corso's Army, but
Air Force started way back

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.480 align:middle line:10%
before the Army, and the
Navy is in charge of UFOs.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:55.060 align:middle line:10%
So the thing that we have is
a very interesting scenario,

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.980 align:middle line:10%
where--

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.710 align:middle line:10%
and I have to follow
Eisenhower too

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.660 align:middle line:10%
because Eisenhower
wrote a letter to one

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.030 align:middle line:10%
of our contactees, our Adamski.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.140 align:middle line:90%
And I have that letter.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.440 align:middle line:90%
They gave it to me.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.140 align:middle line:90%
His name was Genio Siracusa.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.560 align:middle line:10%
He was on the island of Sicily.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:90%
And he was our Adamski.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The Italian Adamski.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yes because he met
with people from Venus who had

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:17.190 align:middle line:90%
the same message.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, first we have
to say Adamski is said to have

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.860 align:middle line:84%
been taken by beings
from Venus up in ships,

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.270 align:middle line:84%
shown a lot about the nature
of how space travel works,

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.760 align:middle line:84%
the future, what's
happening on Earth,

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.990 align:middle line:90%
what we're evolving into.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.320 align:middle line:90%
He was shown a great deal.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are books
written by Adamski.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.332 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Oh, yeah, no--

00:40:36.332 --> 00:40:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Adamski, when he had his meeting
with Orthon at Desert Center,

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.020 align:middle line:90%
he was with five people.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but now it's
coming out that there's even

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.600 align:middle line:90%
a photograph of Orthon.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.583 align:middle line:90%
There's a new book out.

00:40:49.583 --> 00:40:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, so he was
getting all of this from

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Venusians.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Venusians,
and so was--

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So your
guy in Italy--

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: It was
from Venusians.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Now, whether
they came from Venus or not,

00:40:58.650 --> 00:40:59.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to even go there.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.778 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, but
that's what they claimed.

00:41:01.778 --> 00:41:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: But they
looked the same.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:90%
The message was the same.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:10.560 align:middle line:10%
And President Eisenhower
wrote to Siracusa and said--

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.880 align:middle line:10%
and it's got his name.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.350 align:middle line:90%
It's got his signature.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And it said, Mrs.
Eisenhower and I

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:25.110 align:middle line:84%
will try our best to try to work
with this situation of peace.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.940 align:middle line:10%
And I'm wondering,
why would he write

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.390 align:middle line:10%
to an Italian contactee
who doesn't even

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:34.830 align:middle line:10%
speak English, probably, who did
the very same thing as Adamski?

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.350 align:middle line:10%
He went to all the
leaders of Europe

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.630 align:middle line:10%
at that time with the warnings.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.270 align:middle line:10%
So in the 1950s--

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:46.660 align:middle line:10%
1953 to '60s-- we
were warning the world

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:10%
of the dangers of nuclear.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And whether it was Adamski,
Menger, all the people at Giant

00:41:53.980 --> 00:42:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Rock, the Giant Rock crew,
or it was our guy in Sicily,

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.040 align:middle line:84%
somebody should be
connecting dots here.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can't make this up.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're
connecting dots, Paola.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say, you and I are
both fans of the work that was

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.610 align:middle line:84%
coming out in the
'50s and the '60s--

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yes.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --from these
contactee gentlemen.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yes.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They were people that
explained what was going on.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.460 align:middle line:84%
It was done just
like the films you

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.960 align:middle line:90%
see about people in the '50s.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything was done-- even
the bad guys were gentlemanly

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:26.570 align:middle line:90%
in these films.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So this was a very
gentlemanly type

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:84%
of contact, in
which they explained

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.530 align:middle line:84%
what was being shown
to them regarding

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.050 align:middle line:84%
the health of the human
body, for example.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Menger-- his book, many things--

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.778 align:middle line:90%
was it called from Earth to you?

00:42:39.778 --> 00:42:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: "From
Outer Space to You."

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Outer space to you.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And it was that
they lived longer than we do.

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:45.715 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
they explained why.

00:42:45.715 --> 00:42:46.515 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah.

00:42:46.515 --> 00:42:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they talked
about the best way to eat

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:49.540 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of
different kinds of information

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that was coming through
these contactees

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:90%
all through the '50s.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And we're big fans of that.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I find it much more
intriguing than someone

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.400 align:middle line:84%
talking about a Tic Tac kind
of darting through space,

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and do we need to
build more weapons.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.940 align:middle line:90%
What are the real messages?

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're almost out
of time, so tell us

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:84%
in your own mind, from
having read all of it

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and writing the "Connecting
the Dots" book, what

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.750 align:middle line:84%
do you think is the
most important thing

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:20.560 align:middle line:84%
for us to focus on in this
whole big mess called UFOlogy?

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.650 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Well, all the
interviews are in "UFOs

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:27.490 align:middle line:10%
Connecting the Dots,"
and they're word-for-word

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:29.100 align:middle line:10%
interviews.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.250 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that
we're not independent.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.450 align:middle line:90%
We are one.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:10%
When Edgar Mitchell had his
epiphany out in outer space,

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.340 align:middle line:10%
he looked at the
Earth, and he said,

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.980 align:middle line:10%
I want to tell the
people in Congress

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.890 align:middle line:10%
and the people in the world,
there are no boundaries.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So why are we killing each
other over boundaries?

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And God bless Edgar
Mitchell because we

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:90%
are one human species.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.490 align:middle line:90%
We have had contact.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:10%
I've always wondered
if they were

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:10%
going to be official about it,
what country would they go to?

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.950 align:middle line:10%
And what I saw was they may
not go from the top down.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:07.120 align:middle line:10%
They may go to the regular
citizen of the planet that's

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:07.920 align:middle line:10%
a human species.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is
what's happening.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yes.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: People shooting all
these different things with

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:12.360 align:middle line:90%
their cameras saying--

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Exactly.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --wow,
what the heck is that?

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: They're going
to go from the bottom up

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.190 align:middle line:84%
for disclosure because
they're going to go and talk

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:21.180 align:middle line:84%
to the average citizen that
doesn't represent any ideology,

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.040 align:middle line:90%
any religion, any boundaries.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: That's where we
have our problem today in 2023.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.990 align:middle line:84%
We need to get back
to we are one species.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:84%
If there is contact,
we got to do it

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:38.500 align:middle line:84%
like Oppenheimer and
Einstein suggested--

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:39.460 align:middle line:90%
logically.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Logically,
collaboratively,

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.910 align:middle line:90%
and peacefully.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Exactly.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you, Paola.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.410 align:middle line:84%
What is the-- is it called
"Connecting the Dots"?

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Is that the title?

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: "Connecting the
Dots, Making Sense of the UFO

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Phenomena."

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
because you're, to me,

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.870 align:middle line:84%
the most impressive boots on
the ground UFO researcher out

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:56.980 align:middle line:90%
there, period.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of guys have
their name up there and bigger

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.520 align:middle line:90%
than yours, but--

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, but
it's about the work.

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --you're
the one for me.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.098 align:middle line:84%
So it's about the
work, and you do--

00:45:04.098 --> 00:45:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: It's about the work.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.182 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --the work,
so thank you, Paola.

00:45:07.182 --> 00:45:08.313 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: No, thank you.

00:45:08.313 --> 00:45:10.480 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Again, to find
out more about the ramp up

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:10%
to the dropping of
the atomic bomb,

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.750 align:middle line:10%
you can read Paola's
book "Trinity"

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:16.580 align:middle line:10%
and watch the film "Oppenheimer"
and also read "Connecting

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.380 align:middle line:10%
the Dots."

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.040 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
