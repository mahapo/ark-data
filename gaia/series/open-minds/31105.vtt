[ Music ]

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:19.253 align:middle line:84%
In these increasingly
unsettling economic times,

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.856 align:middle line:84%
people have begun to seek
refuge in precious metals

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:24.325 align:middle line:84%
to create a sense of
financial stability.

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:84%
If you've been following
the news, however,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:84%
metals have just taken a steep
dive causing panic among the

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.998 align:middle line:90%
investors around the world.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:84%
With rigged markets and
cash under the mattress

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.371 align:middle line:84%
as the only seeming viable
options, confusion reigns.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.241 align:middle line:84%
Catherine Austin Fitts has made
the study of money her life.

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Her knowledge has taken her from
Wall Street investment banking

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.779 align:middle line:84%
to the White House where she
was a Commissioner for HUD

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.515 align:middle line:84%
under the first Bush
administration.

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:50.184 align:middle line:84%
Today she's an investment
advisor and publisher

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:54.188 align:middle line:84%
of the Solari Report, and she's
here to help us put a little bit

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:90%
of reality on this pancake.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.825 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] This is just...

00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:01.595 align:middle line:84%
I love talking to people like
you, and you're wonderful

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
at talking to people like me
who the world of derivatives

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.436 align:middle line:84%
and investments and
securities and all of this seems

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:12.907 align:middle line:84%
like a upside down
board game of some kind.

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:14.041 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't make sense.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:15.142 align:middle line:90%
It's not a real world.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:16.577 align:middle line:90%
It's not a real language.

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:18.245 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's what's happened.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.248 align:middle line:84%
What we've seen since, and
it's really been the mid-80's,

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:25.953 align:middle line:84%
we've seen an integration of the
financial system with warfare.

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So now rather than drop
our army and go to war,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.492 align:middle line:84%
we're having economic
warfare, and it's happening

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.762 align:middle line:84%
on both the overt
and the covert,

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:38.532 align:middle line:84%
and we can see both the Treasury
and the central bank intervene

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
in the market for reasons that
have to do with geopolitics,

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.238 align:middle line:84%
you know, both political
and economic,

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:46.774 align:middle line:84%
that if you were sitting in
their chair makes total sense,

00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:48.209 align:middle line:84%
but if you're watching
the market,

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.343 align:middle line:90%
it makes absolutely no sense.

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.445 align:middle line:90%
No sense. Yeah.

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget
when I first started

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.548 align:middle line:90%
to study precious metals.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:57.384 align:middle line:84%
A wonderful person
who's very knowledgeable

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:59.987 align:middle line:84%
about commodities marketing
precious metals tried

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:01.288 align:middle line:84%
to interest me, and I
said, "Well, you know,

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:03.457 align:middle line:84%
I have no background in
precious metals," and he said,

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:06.627 align:middle line:84%
"I just want you to watch
the market," and I started

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to watch the price of
gold for about 3 days,

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.698 align:middle line:84%
and I called him back,
and I said, "You know,

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:12.833 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything
about precious metals,

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.369 align:middle line:84%
but I have to tell you, I
know a lot about markets.

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.705 align:middle line:84%
There's no way a market
can behave like this."

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:18.606 align:middle line:90%
This is...

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:21.675 align:middle line:90%
This is a managed situation.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:25.713 align:middle line:84%
This is not a market, and
we've watched that in sector

00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:27.381 align:middle line:90%
after sector, particularly

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.618 align:middle line:84%
as we've centralized both
the control of capital

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:33.053 align:middle line:84%
and we've centralized
different industries.

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:37.524 align:middle line:84%
What you're watching is an
integration of national security

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:41.662 align:middle line:84%
and geopolitical strategy with
financial markets and economics,

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and so oftentimes you'll see the
oil price managed or the price

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.504 align:middle line:84%
of gold managed for
geopolitical strategic reasons

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:53.274 align:middle line:84%
that if you were the Secretary
of the Treasury, you know,

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:54.875 align:middle line:84%
you would think was
the right thing to do,

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:58.746 align:middle line:84%
but the global game is causing
a management that if you're

00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:02.082 align:middle line:84%
in the market trying to
deal with fundamentals,

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:04.718 align:middle line:84%
it's just Orwellian,
and, of course, you know,

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:07.054 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
in these environments

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:09.957 align:middle line:84%
to get adequate information
about what's going on.

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:11.759 align:middle line:90%
So it can be very mind numbing

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.728 align:middle line:84%
for the retail investor
who's just trying

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:16.764 align:middle line:84%
to make sensible
decisions, and up is down,

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:18.165 align:middle line:90%
and down is up, and, you know...

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:90%
That is what it's like.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.435 align:middle line:84%
It's like dropping down
the rabbit hole, [laughter]

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:90%
and the funny thing, I mean...

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.906 align:middle line:84%
Financial puzzle powers
is what I call it.

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:27.107 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Exactly.

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:29.109 align:middle line:84%
Didn't it used to be
something kind of like this?

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.011 align:middle line:84%
I mean if there never
was any kind of market

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:35.649 align:middle line:84%
that when you had an upside in
the stock market, you had kind

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.619 align:middle line:84%
of a downside in metals, and
when the market went down,

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:40.421 align:middle line:90%
metals went up, and it seemed

00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:42.256 align:middle line:84%
to have its own little
balancing act,

00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:44.124 align:middle line:84%
which has long since
disappeared.

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:47.127 align:middle line:84%
Was that ever real, or
was that manipulated, too?

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:48.495 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think to
a certain extent,

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:51.965 align:middle line:84%
there's always been a balance
of fundamental economics

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.567 align:middle line:90%
and markets with management.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:54.901 align:middle line:90%
But not anymore.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.472 align:middle line:84%
Now even those basic kind of
factors don't seem to align.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:03:59.406 align:middle line:90%
Here's what's interesting.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.575 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
people managing,

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.977 align:middle line:84%
fundamental economics
absolutely matter to them.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.079 align:middle line:90%
They are optimizers.

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:05.913 align:middle line:90%
You have to be.

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:06.947 align:middle line:90%
It's a big planet.

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.382 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot of people,

00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:10.751 align:middle line:84%
and so you can't keep
a price, you know.

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
If there's more and more
people and less and less land

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
to grow wheat on, you can't keep
the price of wheat down forever.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So fundamentals matter
to everybody,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.429 align:middle line:90%
but we do see these situations

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.999 align:middle line:84%
where you get enormous
intervention,

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:28.335 align:middle line:84%
not just of governments, but
of various private cartels,

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:31.939 align:middle line:84%
and we're watching an
integration of economic warfare,

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:35.008 align:middle line:84%
of literally warfare with
financial markets, and,

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:38.345 align:middle line:84%
of course, what's happened
as we've centralized

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:42.516 align:middle line:84%
and as we've globalized, digital
technology gives us the ability

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.385 align:middle line:84%
to now create things
like derivatives,

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:48.188 align:middle line:84%
which gives us the
ability to manage

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:49.957 align:middle line:84%
in powerful ways we
never could before.

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:52.459 align:middle line:84%
So we see interest rates
coming down, down, down.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.761 align:middle line:90%
It's like the limbo dance.

00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.362 align:middle line:90%
How low can they go?

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:58.499 align:middle line:84%
And if you look, in fact,
at the books of derivatives,

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.568 align:middle line:84%
the vast majority are
interest rate swaps,

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and that technology is
giving you the ability

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.573 align:middle line:84%
to do these things in ways
that many participants

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:08.375 align:middle line:84%
in the market are
not familiar with.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:10.277 align:middle line:84%
You know, it kind
of snuck up on them.

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:15.516 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolutely changing, and
what it means is that you need

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:21.755 align:middle line:84%
to have a real picture of your
world, which is of an ecosystem.

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.625 align:middle line:84%
Right. So I need to be
able to look, you know,

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.261 align:middle line:84%
when I grew up there were people
who read the New York Times

00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:29.463 align:middle line:84%
and were interested in
policy, and there were people

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:31.498 align:middle line:84%
who read the Wall Street Journal
and were interested in markets,

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.666 align:middle line:84%
and the two were totally
separate universes

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.669 align:middle line:84%
and had nothing to do
with each other, you know.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.872 align:middle line:84%
Right. And now what we're
talking about is an integration

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:41.208 align:middle line:84%
where whether it's
political management

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:44.478 align:middle line:84%
or market fundamentals, you
need to integrate both of them,

00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:47.648 align:middle line:84%
and you need to be able to
see the world as an ecosystem,

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:50.918 align:middle line:84%
a living system on
an integrated basis,

00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:53.654 align:middle line:84%
and if you've been educated
in our system, you know,

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:54.788 align:middle line:90%
there are places in the world

00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:57.291 align:middle line:84%
where people are educated
to think that way.

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:59.927 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not a big
deal here if you've come

00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:02.095 align:middle line:84%
up in your little box and
you're very knowledgeable

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:04.531 align:middle line:84%
in your little box,
it's very shocking.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.732 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it is.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:08.802 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so now the news
the last few days,

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:10.537 align:middle line:90%
it started last Friday.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:15.642 align:middle line:84%
Apparently I remember reading
in one article that 500...

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:21.448 align:middle line:84%
500 tons of gold were dumped
in one day onto the market.

00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:24.618 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing very unusual
patterns in the gold market.

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:30.257 align:middle line:84%
Gold has been in a
consolidation since late 2011.

00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:32.926 align:middle line:84%
We... To give you an
example, gold started

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:35.729 align:middle line:84%
up in a very significant
way about 12 years ago.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.031 align:middle line:90%
So for the last 12 years,

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:41.602 align:middle line:84%
gold has out performed the
Dow every year for 12 years

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:44.571 align:middle line:84%
where that's a stunning
bull market,

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:48.609 align:middle line:84%
and we saw gold hit a
high in September, 2011,

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:51.144 align:middle line:84%
and it's been consolidating
since,

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:54.648 align:middle line:84%
and what's interesting
is the primary move

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:57.651 align:middle line:84%
up in gold has very
much tracked two things.

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.654 align:middle line:84%
One is the increase
in treasury debt

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:02.656 align:middle line:84%
and sovereign government
debt worldwide.

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:06.827 align:middle line:84%
So the more we print, you know,
and gold is not so much going

00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:10.931 align:middle line:84%
up in value as the fiat
currency is going down in value.

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
call debasement.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.336 align:middle line:84%
So but we've also seen
is for the last, say,

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:18.972 align:middle line:84%
5 years a very tight
relationship...

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:23.076 align:middle line:84%
If you do a correlation of the
copper price with the S&P 500,

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:24.645 align:middle line:84%
you get a very tight
correlation.

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:29.583 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen the
Federal Reserve does a

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:30.417 align:middle line:90%
quantitative ease.

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:31.652 align:middle line:90%
It's called quantitative ease,

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:34.187 align:middle line:84%
and so they spend the money
supply, and commodities

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:35.389 align:middle line:90%
and stocks go up together.

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:39.092 align:middle line:84%
So risk-based assets, real
things, go up together.

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
What suddenly started last
year is a tremendous divergence

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:84%
between commodities and the
stock market and you see it.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.404 align:middle line:84%
If it's quite extraordinary,
divergence of the copper price

00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:52.606 align:middle line:84%
and stocks, and you're
watching it,

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:54.675 align:middle line:84%
and you're thinking
how can this be?

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:56.642 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:59.279 align:middle line:84%
Now the market people
would argue

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.916 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing
tremendous deflation globally.

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:06.787 align:middle line:84%
The economy's slowing down,
and that's very deflationary.

00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:10.223 align:middle line:84%
You know, the people who argue
that the system is managed say,

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:14.328 align:middle line:84%
you know, "This can't
occur naturally."

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:17.664 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, you
have reasons to want

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.901 align:middle line:84%
to bring commodity prices down,
and you have reasons to want

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:22.536 align:middle line:84%
to bring the precious
metals prices

00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:26.406 align:middle line:84%
down that are very powerful
from a management standpoint,

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:28.976 align:middle line:84%
and when we saw, we saw
a very powerful drop,

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:30.877 align:middle line:84%
we had one of the big
Wall Street firms come

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:33.847 align:middle line:84%
out on Wednesday and say,
"Oh, gold's going down.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.284 align:middle line:84%
We recommend to all of
our clients to short it."

00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:38.484 align:middle line:90%
And then you...

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:42.022 align:middle line:84%
it was stable for a day,
and then Friday, nosedive.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Right. Monday, more nosedive,
and then after the nosedive

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.264 align:middle line:84%
on Monday, you see the
CME come out and say, "Oh,

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:53.467 align:middle line:84%
we're increasing margin
requirements on gold, silver."

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:56.136 align:middle line:84%
Margin requirements is one of
the things that gets increased,

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:58.605 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, you pull
up the margin requirements

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:00.607 align:middle line:90%
and the market price drops.

00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:01.742 align:middle line:90%
So there's a...

00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:05.379 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's
several powerful arguments

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:09.516 align:middle line:84%
as to why institutionally
the people

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:11.852 align:middle line:84%
who manage the financial
system and are concerned

00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:14.521 align:middle line:84%
with financial stability
could want gold to come down.

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:17.924 align:middle line:84%
Is there a gold cartel
so to speak?

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look at who has
traditionally managed this

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
market, the bullion banks in
London and the United States,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.369 align:middle line:84%
and that says, "Yes,
there's a gold cartel,"

00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:30.937 align:middle line:90%
but in my personal experience,

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:36.309 align:middle line:84%
gold is probably the most
important asset globally

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
that behind the scenes
is used to balance trade.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.849 align:middle line:84%
You know, gold is the power
within the financial community,

00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:46.953 align:middle line:84%
gold is one of the
major power positions.

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:50.991 align:middle line:84%
So I don't care what
the price is, you know,

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:54.561 align:middle line:84%
who's got the gold is
a very important part.

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:57.764 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, and what seemed to
me to be happening, and, again,

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:02.402 align:middle line:84%
I'm just an amateur spectator,
but what seemed to me is

00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:05.172 align:middle line:84%
that this was also
an interesting way

00:10:05.172 --> 00:10:08.208 align:middle line:84%
as the stakes rise
globally and it becomes...

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:10.811 align:middle line:84%
the system seems to be coming
more apart at the seams

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to start flushing out private
ownership of gold, too.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.682 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people freaked
out and started selling.

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:18.418 align:middle line:84%
Right. Well if you want to bring
in a lot of inventory fast,

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:19.119 align:middle line:90%
this is how you do it.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.087 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, crash the price.

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:21.922 align:middle line:84%
You crash the price,
but let's look

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:24.591 align:middle line:90%
at financial stability globally.

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:27.694 align:middle line:84%
We have had for many decades
what's called a long term bull

00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:29.129 align:middle line:90%
market in bonds.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.965 align:middle line:84%
Interest rates have been
coming down, down, down,

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.435 align:middle line:84%
and that has put a floor
in the price of bonds.

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:38.772 align:middle line:84%
We've seen tremendous investment
both institutional and retail go

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:43.043 align:middle line:84%
into bonds, and everyone's
looking at this huge bond market

00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:45.011 align:middle line:84%
because we've been printing,
printing, printing, printing,

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:47.214 align:middle line:90%
printing, and saying, you know,

00:10:47.214 --> 00:10:50.584 align:middle line:84%
interest rates can't go
much lower, so what's going

00:10:50.584 --> 00:10:51.985 align:middle line:90%
to happen when this turns?

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:55.222 align:middle line:84%
Right. And, of course, there are
several things that can happen.

00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:59.326 align:middle line:84%
One thing is we can literally do
a planetary debt for equity swap

00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:02.496 align:middle line:84%
and move money into the equity
markets and shift the model,

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:05.999 align:middle line:84%
shift, you know, be on an
equity model, but, you know,

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.934 align:middle line:90%
that's the nice solution.

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:09.636 align:middle line:90%
That would be the nice result.

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:13.173 align:middle line:84%
The not so nice is everybody
rushes for safety to get

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.875 align:middle line:84%
out of the bond market
if interest...

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:18.445 align:middle line:84%
because if interest rates
turn, let alone turn sharply,

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:21.915 align:middle line:84%
we can see much more precipitous
drops in the value of bonds

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:24.584 align:middle line:90%
than even, you know, in the kind

00:11:24.584 --> 00:11:26.286 align:middle line:84%
of volatility we've
seen in equity.

00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:30.257 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly equities are looking
even less volatile than bonds,

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:33.527 align:middle line:84%
and so if you're the managers
of the financial system,

00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:36.863 align:middle line:84%
that's a stampede
you want to prevent.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we've seen a series
of things we need to talk

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.034 align:middle line:90%
about bank resolutions.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.636 align:middle line:90%
We've seen a series of things

00:11:42.636 --> 00:11:45.505 align:middle line:84%
that is making the retail
investor, the citizen,

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:50.243 align:middle line:84%
nervous about the stability
of the financial system,

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:51.878 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things
that happens

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.347 align:middle line:84%
when that happens is they
start to buy precious metals.

00:11:54.347 --> 00:11:55.648 align:middle line:90%
Right. Right.

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:59.119 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, and they
start to move their money

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:01.188 align:middle line:90%
out of risk based investments.

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:02.989 align:middle line:90%
They start to move out of bonds.

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:06.159 align:middle line:84%
In February, I'll never
forget it, I went to one

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:09.663 align:middle line:84%
of the services that
provides information

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:84%
on different financial
products in February, and I...

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.736 align:middle line:84%
because I never invest in the
long Treasury bond market.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.905 align:middle line:90%
So I don't watch it closely.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:22.876 align:middle line:84%
The 6 month return
on their aggregate

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:27.247 align:middle line:84%
of all bond funds focused on
US Treasuries in February,

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
guess what the last
6 month return was.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:33.019 align:middle line:90%
Negative 7.6%.

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:33.587 align:middle line:90%
Negative...

00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:34.988 align:middle line:90%
Negative 7...

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Now if you're trying to finance
we now have the Federal Reserve

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:90%
buying over 90% of the auctions.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.098 align:middle line:84%
Right. Okay, so if you're
responsible to borrow the money,

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.234 align:middle line:84%
you need to finance
Social Security

00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:49.369 align:middle line:84%
to finance disability
to finance welfare.

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:52.772 align:middle line:84%
Right. To finance all
those defense contracts,

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and the treasury market
is dropping that fast.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.078 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're going

00:12:58.078 --> 00:12:59.846 align:middle line:84%
from something that's
relatively stable

00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:03.516 align:middle line:84%
to something that's experiencing
relatively swift drops.

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:05.252 align:middle line:90%
That's a real...

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:10.423 align:middle line:84%
So you have to create something
to shift the relative value.

00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:12.092 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to
defend the bond market,

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:15.428 align:middle line:84%
and the interesting thing is
to defend the bond market,

00:13:15.428 --> 00:13:17.264 align:middle line:84%
you've got to defend
the stock market.

00:13:17.264 --> 00:13:18.665 align:middle line:90%
Right. Okay?

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:22.002 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to find a managed
process for these things to...

00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:25.538 align:middle line:84%
you know, for these
shifts to happen,

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.941 align:middle line:84%
and the problem is precious
metals is a little bit

00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:29.709 align:middle line:90%
like the smoke alarm.

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:32.412 align:middle line:84%
You know, the price
moves up too fast,

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:34.948 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly
everybody's looking.

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:36.316 align:middle line:90%
Right... at what's going on.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:39.085 align:middle line:84%
Right. You've got a
spiral, a danger, a spiral,

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:42.923 align:middle line:84%
or a contagion happening
that can be very dangerous.

00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:44.023 align:middle line:90%
But what about in reverse

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:46.993 align:middle line:84%
like what happened
last Friday and Monday?

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.295 align:middle line:84%
Well here's the interesting
thing

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:50.964 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know what
happened or why it happened

00:13:50.964 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and how much was markets
versus management,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.071 align:middle line:84%
but let me just postulate
some possible scenarios.

00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:04.611 align:middle line:84%
We know we've had quite a sort
of alarm bell ring globally

00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:06.846 align:middle line:84%
as a result of what
happened in Cyprus.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.515 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about that
in some detail, yeah.

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:13.253 align:middle line:84%
Right. So the first, you
know, for my entire lifetime,

00:14:13.253 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
we have most people in the
developed world saying, "Oh,

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.659 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to worry that we're
running the economy in a way

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:22.629 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't make sense because
I have a government guarantee.

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:23.763 align:middle line:90%
I have a treasury bond.

00:14:23.763 --> 00:14:25.198 align:middle line:90%
I have an insured deposit.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:25.999 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to worry.

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:27.067 align:middle line:90%
You know, my deck chair

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:29.002 align:middle line:84%
on the Titanic is
government-guaranteed,

00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:31.471 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to worry
about, you know, the boat,

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:33.039 align:middle line:84%
because the boat's
big and safe, right?

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.174 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:36.443 align:middle line:84%
So we've all been living
in this sort of bubble

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:37.777 align:middle line:90%
where we don't have to worry

00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:40.113 align:middle line:84%
about whether things
are fundamentally sound.

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:41.948 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the problem
with being in a debt

00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:43.783 align:middle line:84%
versus an equity model
and why I think going

00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:45.251 align:middle line:84%
in an equity model
is very healthy,

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:50.657 align:middle line:84%
but so what happened was the
first IMF and ECB proposal

00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
for the resolution of the
banking problems in Cyprus was

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.532 align:middle line:84%
to tax the insured deposits,
and even when they backed off,

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:90%
there was a huge uproar.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.669 align:middle line:84%
Even when they backed
off, you know,

00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:06.039 align:middle line:84%
capital controls were placed
on it, which said if you're

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:08.775 align:middle line:84%
in a weaker bank or a
weaker country, you know,

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:84%
your euro insurance
is not so good

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.512 align:middle line:84%
as the euro insurance
in Germany.

00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:14.581 align:middle line:84%
You know, now you're
talking about a 2-tiered,

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:16.449 align:middle line:90%
and that was a wakeup call

00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:18.985 align:middle line:84%
because that was the first time
really in the developed world

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:22.155 align:middle line:84%
that somebody said,
you know, "Yeah,

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:84%
maybe you have insurance,
maybe you don't."

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.992 align:middle line:84%
Right. You know, so
immediately everybody

00:15:25.992 --> 00:15:29.963 align:middle line:84%
in the United States is
saying, "Well, what about FDIC?"

00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, what had been happening
was we went through the process

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.239 align:middle line:84%
in the 2008-2009 where we
bailed out banks, and of course,

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:41.775 align:middle line:84%
Europe has been going
through a situation

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
where literally what we did
is we took the debt that was

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.814 align:middle line:84%
on the banks and we moved
it to the government.

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:50.383 align:middle line:84%
You know, so government
bailed out the debt,

00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:55.622 align:middle line:84%
and the banks got protected at
the cost of the greater system,

00:15:55.622 --> 00:16:01.061 align:middle line:84%
and when we passed Dot
Frank after the bailouts,

00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:84%
we passed a law, Dot
Frank, and said, okay,

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.800 align:middle line:84%
the regulators can't do
too big to fail anymore.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.537 align:middle line:84%
They've got to come up with
resolution methods that allow us

00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
to take down a bank,
strip a bank apart,

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.545 align:middle line:84%
resolve a troubled bank without
guaranteeing all their deposit

00:16:18.545 --> 00:16:20.447 align:middle line:84%
and allowing them to
keep behaving this way.

00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
We need big banks to
fail, and we absolutely do

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.454 align:middle line:84%
because we have created
a financial sector,

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:30.323 align:middle line:84%
which is far bigger
than what we need,

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.325 align:middle line:90%
and it's become like a tapeworm.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:33.726 align:middle line:90%
Right. Right.

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:37.564 align:middle line:84%
Right. So you say we need
the large banks to fail.

00:16:37.564 --> 00:16:42.068 align:middle line:84%
We need a way to shrink this
industry back to a level

00:16:42.068 --> 00:16:44.704 align:middle line:84%
which supports fundamental
economics

00:16:44.704 --> 00:16:46.706 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to as a parasite.

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, so we need
to shrink the sector.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.778 align:middle line:90%
How do we do it?

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:55.782 align:middle line:84%
So the regulators were
required by Dot Frank to go out

00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:57.317 align:middle line:84%
and figure out how they
were going to do this

00:16:57.317 --> 00:16:59.185 align:middle line:84%
and get this ready,
and, in fact,

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:03.322 align:middle line:84%
we've seen publications both
in Europe and North America

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:06.626 align:middle line:84%
with regulations saying, okay,
here's how we're going to do it,

00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:09.162 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, what it means is
the uninsured deposits are going

00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:10.763 align:middle line:84%
to get written off,
the creditors are going

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.932 align:middle line:84%
to get written off or
swapped for equity,

00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:18.404 align:middle line:84%
and so the world is now looking
at this and realizing, oh,

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:22.274 align:middle line:84%
you know, accountability as we
can, you know, is on its way.

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:24.944 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you are in
an environment

00:17:24.944 --> 00:17:29.716 align:middle line:84%
where you're a regulator and
you have to resolve a large bank

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:34.654 align:middle line:84%
in this way, one of the dangers
is if the gold price is high

00:17:34.654 --> 00:17:40.527 align:middle line:84%
and it sends an alarm bell like
Cyprus did where everybody said,

00:17:40.527 --> 00:17:42.729 align:middle line:84%
you know, everybody who
had gold in Cyprus was

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.898 align:middle line:84%
in much better shape than
everybody who had, you know,

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.166 align:middle line:90%
insured bank deposits.

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:51.671 align:middle line:84%
Right. So if you're a regulator,
you have reason to want

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
to get a reset in
the gold price.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.378 align:middle line:84%
Because that will help reset the
value of the dollar, etc. Well,

00:17:58.378 --> 00:18:03.249 align:middle line:84%
because let's say your gold high
has been approximately 1900.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:06.052 align:middle line:84%
Now you're a little
bit below 1400.

00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:09.589 align:middle line:84%
You reset it down to 1400,
then you resolve the bank even

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:12.759 align:middle line:84%
if it kicks it back up to
1800, you know, you're still

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:17.263 align:middle line:84%
within the zone, and my guess,
and this is just a guess,

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
is that it is in the interest
of the financial system

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.137 align:middle line:84%
to have a managed rise
in the gold price,

00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:27.507 align:middle line:84%
but to have a managed
rise and to do it in a way

00:18:27.507 --> 00:18:33.246 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't trigger this
contagion throughout the bond

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:35.915 align:middle line:84%
market because the bond
market is the big intimidator.

00:18:35.915 --> 00:18:39.886 align:middle line:84%
Right. But yet at the same
time while this was going on,

00:18:39.886 --> 00:18:42.455 align:middle line:84%
I was reading, you know,
various articles on it,

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.123 align:middle line:84%
and one of the articles
was saying remember,

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.059 align:middle line:90%
this is a paper market.

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:90%
This is a paper market.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.798 align:middle line:84%
It's not the real asset physical
gold, and then at the same time,

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:55.235 align:middle line:84%
the price of paper gold
was dropping like a stone,

00:18:55.235 --> 00:19:00.073 align:middle line:84%
the buy-to-sell ratio in the
physical market was 50 to 1.

00:19:00.073 --> 00:19:03.076 align:middle line:90%
There have been, you know,

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:06.613 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the physical
market both institutional

00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:10.516 align:middle line:84%
and retail, there have
been very unusual patterns.

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:11.718 align:middle line:90%
So in the retail markets here

00:19:11.718 --> 00:19:15.722 align:middle line:84%
in the United States we've
seen tremendous reports

00:19:15.722 --> 00:19:17.523 align:middle line:84%
at retail level from
the dealers.

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:18.458 align:middle line:90%
They can't get product.

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:19.826 align:middle line:90%
They can't...

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:22.362 align:middle line:84%
Right. You know, 90% silver,
they can't get it at any price.

00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:28.001 align:middle line:84%
We saw the premiums on 90%
go from 2 to 3% to, you know,

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:31.204 align:middle line:84%
12% to clear and then you
couldn't clear it at any price,

00:19:31.204 --> 00:19:32.739 align:middle line:90%
which is very unusual.

00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:36.976 align:middle line:84%
So that would indicate that
it's the paper price coming down

00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:39.846 align:middle line:84%
and the physical market
can't clear the paper price.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:43.082 align:middle line:84%
Now I've had reports from
both the institutional...

00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:45.852 align:middle line:84%
you see reports from the
institutional markets

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:48.087 align:middle line:90%
that there's serious problems

00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:51.658 align:middle line:84%
in the physical market
or seizes up .

00:19:51.658 --> 00:19:53.559 align:middle line:84%
Others say we're not
having problems at all.

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's...

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.995 align:middle line:90%
What kind of problems?

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:59.432 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, we see the
Bundesbank saying they want

00:19:59.432 --> 00:20:05.638 align:middle line:84%
their gold back from Paris and
from New York, and, you know,

00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:08.274 align:middle line:84%
and Paris and New York
saying, "Oh well, 7 years."

00:20:08.274 --> 00:20:09.609 align:middle line:90%
Give us seven years.

00:20:09.609 --> 00:20:11.778 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] Yeah, like give
us a little time to tap dance

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:13.479 align:middle line:90%
and find that gold for you.

00:20:13.479 --> 00:20:14.947 align:middle line:90%
It's clear, you know,

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:18.685 align:middle line:84%
many people hold their
precious metals in a bank

00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
in what's called an
unallocated pool.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's not gold
sitting in their vault.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.358 align:middle line:84%
It's sitting in their
safe deposit box.

00:20:25.358 --> 00:20:28.161 align:middle line:84%
It's in a pool managed by
the bank, and, you know,

00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:30.863 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty likely
that many of those

00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:33.099 align:middle line:84%
on allocated pools don't
really have the gold.

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:34.467 align:middle line:90%
Right. Right.

00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:38.037 align:middle line:84%
So you see institutions now
saying, "If you want your gold,

00:20:38.037 --> 00:20:41.474 align:middle line:84%
you have to sell it, and we
give you cash," you know,

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:43.509 align:middle line:84%
or you see different
trading exchanges saying...

00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:47.146 align:middle line:84%
That you can't get your physical
gold back because it's gone.

00:20:47.146 --> 00:20:51.617 align:middle line:84%
So, one of the, you know,
one theory is that at times

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:84%
like this you see what
I call snap, crackle,

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.123 align:middle line:84%
pop throughout the
institutional inventories.

00:20:57.123 --> 00:21:00.159 align:middle line:84%
You know, people are racing
to cover their shufflings,

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:03.963 align:middle line:84%
and I think it wouldn't surprise
me if Cyprus rang a bell

00:21:03.963 --> 00:21:06.099 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people suddenly
wanted to take delivery

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.834 align:middle line:90%
of their gold, or, you know...

00:21:07.834 --> 00:21:10.536 align:middle line:84%
So you're seeing a little
bit of snap, crackle, pop,

00:21:10.536 --> 00:21:15.641 align:middle line:84%
but there was one other thing I
wanted to mention, which is one

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:18.378 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest inventories
worldwide

00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:23.082 align:middle line:84%
in gold has been the
inventories behind the exchange

00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:24.484 align:middle line:90%
traded funds.

00:21:24.484 --> 00:21:25.485 align:middle line:90%
So if you look at the...

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:28.054 align:middle line:84%
I have an article
called "Disclosure

00:21:28.054 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and the Precious Metals
Puzzle Palace," which is

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.092 align:middle line:84%
about the large gold
and silver ETF's,

00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:36.295 align:middle line:84%
and the gold one's GLD
is the ticker symbol.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:40.633 align:middle line:84%
There have been reports of
very unusual, as the price

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:44.537 align:middle line:84%
of gold has come down, huge
inventory leaving the GLD,

00:21:44.537 --> 00:21:48.341 align:middle line:84%
you know, and you kind of wonder
well, they were stockpiling it

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:51.477 align:middle line:84%
on the way up and now they are
shifting it on the way down.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.579 align:middle line:90%
What is going on behind there?

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:55.848 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look
at those moves,

00:21:55.848 --> 00:21:58.584 align:middle line:84%
I suspect something
is very much up.

00:21:58.584 --> 00:22:02.121 align:middle line:84%
So there's clearly the behavior
of the physical market appears

00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:05.391 align:middle line:84%
to be very different than the
behavior of the paper market,

00:22:05.391 --> 00:22:07.827 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of the reasons
the interesting thing

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:11.898 align:middle line:84%
in this environment has been
when you see a price drop

00:22:11.898 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
that is that precipitous, what
I would expect is, you know,

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.973 align:middle line:84%
you would expect
a sense of panic.

00:22:20.973 --> 00:22:23.776 align:middle line:84%
What's been most unusual, and
I think Cyprus had a lot to do

00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:27.847 align:middle line:84%
with this, you see a lot
of retail gold investors.

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:30.416 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying professionals,
you know,

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:33.152 align:middle line:84%
and so these are people whose
positions are not margin

00:22:33.152 --> 00:22:35.154 align:middle line:90%
or they're holding them at home.

00:22:35.154 --> 00:22:38.224 align:middle line:84%
You know, their first
reaction is should I buy more?

00:22:38.224 --> 00:22:39.058 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Yeah.

00:22:39.058 --> 00:22:40.126 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:22:40.126 --> 00:22:41.327 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:22:41.327 --> 00:22:43.296 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
having the intended effect.

00:22:43.296 --> 00:22:48.701 align:middle line:84%
Right. And the other is sort
of this is hard to stomach,

00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:52.038 align:middle line:84%
but if I sold my gold,
where would I go?

00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Exactly. And because the...

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.375 align:middle line:90%
I think there is a remark...

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:59.846 align:middle line:84%
you know, I find that
most people are smart

00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.447 align:middle line:90%
about the basics.

00:23:01.447 --> 00:23:05.451 align:middle line:84%
What they know is cash is
not what it was in 2008.

00:23:05.451 --> 00:23:09.322 align:middle line:84%
In 2008 when we saw
gold and stocks crash,

00:23:09.322 --> 00:23:11.958 align:middle line:90%
you know, we could go to cash.

00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:13.259 align:middle line:90%
We could go to fixed income.

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:15.428 align:middle line:90%
We could go to bonds.

00:23:15.428 --> 00:23:19.031 align:middle line:84%
Cash and bonds are not looking
so attractive right now,

00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:21.968 align:middle line:84%
and so I think, you
know, I think people...

00:23:21.968 --> 00:23:26.706 align:middle line:84%
we're getting much more used to
living in a world of volatility

00:23:26.706 --> 00:23:29.208 align:middle line:84%
and saying, "Look, I want
something that's real."

00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:30.376 align:middle line:90%
That's real, yeah.

00:23:30.376 --> 00:23:33.246 align:middle line:90%
So a company that has...

00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:37.383 align:middle line:84%
that makes a very useful product
or service and can provide me

00:23:37.383 --> 00:23:40.353 align:middle line:90%
with a dividend is real.

00:23:40.353 --> 00:23:44.357 align:middle line:84%
A gold coin that I can
hold in my hand is real.

00:23:44.357 --> 00:23:46.926 align:middle line:90%
Land and real estate is real.

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:51.464 align:middle line:84%
So you're starting to see, you
know, what's been happening

00:23:51.464 --> 00:23:54.333 align:middle line:84%
for many, many decades
is, and you've got

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:56.435 align:middle line:84%
to give them credit,
they're very clever.

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:90%
You know, I call it Mr. Global,

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.374 align:middle line:84%
but Mr. Global has been
saying is, you know, "Regina,

00:24:01.374 --> 00:24:03.543 align:middle line:84%
just give me your money,
and I'll give you a nice,

00:24:03.543 --> 00:24:06.512 align:middle line:84%
steady yield, and you don't have
to worry about the ups and downs

00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:90%
and vagaries of this world.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.516 align:middle line:84%
You finance me controlling
the land

00:24:10.516 --> 00:24:13.553 align:middle line:84%
and controlling the companies
and controlling the gold,

00:24:13.553 --> 00:24:16.756 align:middle line:84%
and you just stay in your
bubble," and you're like, "Cool,

00:24:16.756 --> 00:24:18.024 align:middle line:90%
you know, that's a nice world."

00:24:18.024 --> 00:24:19.058 align:middle line:90%
Nice and easy.

00:24:19.058 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's easy
and sort of Madoff.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.094 align:middle line:90%
You know that's the Madoff,

00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:24.931 align:middle line:84%
and now what's happening
is we're saying,

00:24:24.931 --> 00:24:26.332 align:middle line:90%
"Well wait a minute.

00:24:26.332 --> 00:24:30.436 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'd rather own the land,
own the gold, own the companies

00:24:30.436 --> 00:24:34.874 align:middle line:84%
and have, you know, financed
Mr. Global controlling

00:24:34.874 --> 00:24:36.108 align:middle line:90%
and owning me.

00:24:36.108 --> 00:24:37.944 align:middle line:84%
Yes. You know, because
this guy's getting too big.

00:24:37.944 --> 00:24:39.845 align:middle line:84%
That seems like a
big shift in mindset.

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Right. So I'd rather, you know,
finance these things directly

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.518 align:middle line:90%
and not go through his fund

00:24:45.518 --> 00:24:47.887 align:middle line:84%
or his exchange rate
[inaudible] or whatever.

00:24:47.887 --> 00:24:49.121 align:middle line:90%
I want to be...

00:24:49.121 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
you know, but then suddenly
you're like, "Oh my God,

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.625 align:middle line:84%
this is really a
volatile world."

00:24:52.625 --> 00:24:55.361 align:middle line:84%
Right. You know, this is
really a dangerous world,

00:24:55.361 --> 00:24:58.764 align:middle line:84%
and he's trying to pump and
dump me out of my assets.

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:03.636 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it's a, you
know, you're getting played

00:25:03.636 --> 00:25:06.672 align:middle line:84%
at the micro level by
his ability to whip

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:08.074 align:middle line:90%
up the stock and sell you on it.

00:25:08.074 --> 00:25:09.108 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:09.108 --> 00:25:11.277 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a funny
kind of situation

00:25:11.277 --> 00:25:13.245 align:middle line:84%
where you have to
know the value.

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:16.515 align:middle line:84%
You have to know why you're
investing in something,

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:18.751 align:middle line:90%
and you need to be able to...

00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:20.086 align:middle line:90%
...ride it.

00:25:20.086 --> 00:25:22.788 align:middle line:84%
It was funny, when I personally
first started to buy gold

00:25:22.788 --> 00:25:26.959 align:middle line:84%
and silver, it was many
years ago, and, you know,

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:29.729 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never forget
buying some at 457

00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:32.398 align:middle line:84%
and literally the next
day it dropped to 400,

00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:35.167 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't seem like a big
drop now, but it was then,

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:38.304 align:middle line:84%
and my cousin has a cow pasture
behind me, and I'm literally,

00:25:38.304 --> 00:25:40.439 align:middle line:84%
I just went out and talked to
the cows, and the cows looked

00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%
at me and said, "You know,
you just need to chill."

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.145 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] And, you know,
but it took me several

00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:50.116 align:middle line:84%
of those huge dumps because
this is a pretty big one,

00:25:50.116 --> 00:25:52.785 align:middle line:84%
but we've been through
huge drops before.

00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:54.587 align:middle line:84%
Well, and let me
ask you something.

00:25:54.587 --> 00:25:58.324 align:middle line:84%
In there you were talking about
the value, and this dump before,

00:25:58.324 --> 00:26:02.662 align:middle line:84%
is the paper value tied to
the actual physical value

00:26:02.662 --> 00:26:05.031 align:middle line:84%
or is it starting to
diverge a bit now?

00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:06.899 align:middle line:84%
If you actually went
to a coin dealer...

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:08.934 align:middle line:84%
It goes through times
when it diverges.

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:13.039 align:middle line:84%
So it absolutely does
diverge, and, you know,

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:15.341 align:middle line:84%
there are absolutely times
in the precious metals market

00:26:15.341 --> 00:26:16.909 align:middle line:90%
when I think the price is higher

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:19.378 align:middle line:84%
than what I think the
fundamental value is.

00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:23.315 align:middle line:84%
Right. So, you know, you have
to be very careful, you know,

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:26.218 align:middle line:84%
when you get in and when you
get out because you can be

00:26:26.218 --> 00:26:29.055 align:middle line:84%
in a long term primary trend and
still get hammered if you get

00:26:29.055 --> 00:26:30.456 align:middle line:90%
in wrong and get out wrong.

00:26:30.456 --> 00:26:35.728 align:middle line:84%
Yes. One country who certainly
seems to have felt comfortable

00:26:35.728 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
with the investment in gold
for quite a while now is China.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.933 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is they
have been purchasing massive

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and massive amounts of physical
gold for quite some time.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.404 align:middle line:90%
That's all the indication.

00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:50.042 align:middle line:84%
Now and the people who argue
this is a market change.

00:26:50.042 --> 00:26:53.079 align:middle line:84%
One of the big drops we had
the report come out Thursday,

00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:56.716 align:middle line:84%
Friday that the economy
was slowing in China,

00:26:56.716 --> 00:27:00.453 align:middle line:84%
and so the people who argue this
was, you know, global deflation

00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:03.456 align:middle line:84%
from a slowing economy is
saying China's not going

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:05.991 align:middle line:84%
to be buying what they
were because both China

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:08.127 align:middle line:90%
and India are big, big buyers...

00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:09.228 align:middle line:90%
big, big buyers.

00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So they've taken the
conservative position

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.733 align:middle line:84%
because of the craziness
of the market.

00:27:13.733 --> 00:27:15.067 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I think.

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I think, you know, what I
see in people who participate

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.642 align:middle line:84%
in the commodities or financial
markets, when something

00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:26.512 align:middle line:90%
like Friday and Monday happen...

00:27:26.512 --> 00:27:32.485 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about April
12 and April 15, which coincided

00:27:32.485 --> 00:27:35.221 align:middle line:84%
and was the same day of the
horrible event in Boston.

00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:35.888 align:middle line:90%
And tax filing day.

00:27:35.888 --> 00:27:36.722 align:middle line:90%
And tax filing day.

00:27:36.722 --> 00:27:38.557 align:middle line:90%
Which is extremely...

00:27:38.557 --> 00:27:39.859 align:middle line:90%
Very... yes.

00:27:39.859 --> 00:27:43.295 align:middle line:84%
Extremely painful for, you
know, if you're an American

00:27:43.295 --> 00:27:47.633 align:middle line:84%
and you have to file taxes
and you're paying taxes

00:27:47.633 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
to a government that is not
acting in your best interest

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.738 align:middle line:84%
and is trying to
take away your guns

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:55.474 align:middle line:84%
and all this other
stuff, you're very...

00:27:55.474 --> 00:27:58.277 align:middle line:84%
it's a very tense day
for many Americans.

00:27:58.277 --> 00:28:00.746 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so you have all these
things going on at once,

00:28:00.746 --> 00:28:07.386 align:middle line:84%
and the problem is not I think
most people I know are very

00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:12.725 align:middle line:84%
sensible, and they look at these
things and they say, "You know,

00:28:12.725 --> 00:28:16.195 align:middle line:84%
my entire economy, my
entire financial system,

00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:90%
is not under adult supervision."

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Right. And that scares them.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.604 align:middle line:84%
That scares them because what
they're saying is I'm operating

00:28:25.604 --> 00:28:29.942 align:middle line:84%
in a governance system
and a management system

00:28:29.942 --> 00:28:32.044 align:middle line:90%
which has lost it mind.

00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:33.979 align:middle line:90%
Now, some of that happens

00:28:33.979 --> 00:28:37.983 align:middle line:84%
because the system has not
lost its mind, but it's acting

00:28:37.983 --> 00:28:39.418 align:middle line:90%
for geopolitical interests.

00:28:39.418 --> 00:28:42.755 align:middle line:84%
It can't tell you why it's doing
what it's doing, and if you were

00:28:42.755 --> 00:28:45.991 align:middle line:84%
in their seat, you would
do the same thing, but,

00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.394 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's very difficult.

00:28:48.394 --> 00:28:49.762 align:middle line:84%
That's not comforting
to the consumer.

00:28:49.762 --> 00:28:50.896 align:middle line:90%
Right, it's not comforting.

00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:52.431 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, you
can make no sense to it.

00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:55.467 align:middle line:84%
There's no logic to it
anymore from our perspective.

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.937 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think over time
you can make sense of it.

00:28:57.937 --> 00:29:01.106 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can.

00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:02.808 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] [Inaudible] You know,
one of the reasons I decided

00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:06.245 align:middle line:84%
to do the Solari Report was
to help people understand.

00:29:06.245 --> 00:29:08.214 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So I'll give
you an example.

00:29:08.214 --> 00:29:11.116 align:middle line:90%
One of my favorite books

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:14.253 align:middle line:84%
for helping people understand
these issues is a book called

00:29:14.253 --> 00:29:15.688 align:middle line:90%
"The Oil Card," by Jim Norman.

00:29:15.688 --> 00:29:17.423 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're
familiar with it.

00:29:17.423 --> 00:29:19.291 align:middle line:84%
I can't recommend
it highly enough.

00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:22.027 align:middle line:84%
Jim Norman for many, many years
covered the energy markets

00:29:22.027 --> 00:29:25.064 align:middle line:84%
for Business Week, and then he
went to Forbes, made the mistake

00:29:25.064 --> 00:29:27.433 align:middle line:84%
of writing a story that
involved promised software.

00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:30.336 align:middle line:84%
Oops. Had to leave it
and ended up in Platts,

00:29:30.336 --> 00:29:33.672 align:middle line:84%
which is the leading trade
journal in the oil markets,

00:29:33.672 --> 00:29:35.941 align:middle line:84%
one of the leading
ones, and is, you know,

00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:39.979 align:middle line:84%
30 years of deep knowledge
on oil and gas and energy,

00:29:39.979 --> 00:29:42.648 align:middle line:84%
and when he retired, he wrote
a book called "The Oil Card,"

00:29:42.648 --> 00:29:46.485 align:middle line:84%
which talks about the
management of the oil price

00:29:46.485 --> 00:29:50.289 align:middle line:84%
for geopolitical strategic
reasons, and, you know,

00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:52.191 align:middle line:90%
you'll often see, you know,

00:29:52.191 --> 00:29:55.127 align:middle line:84%
during the 80's you
saw the oil price...

00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:57.463 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the oil price
be way above market

00:29:57.463 --> 00:30:00.065 align:middle line:84%
or way below market,
and for long periods

00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:01.700 align:middle line:90%
of time you can't fathom.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.272 align:middle line:84%
It's very Orwellian, and
you read Jim's theories

00:30:06.272 --> 00:30:08.974 align:middle line:84%
on why this happened
and the politics of it,

00:30:08.974 --> 00:30:11.443 align:middle line:84%
it makes absolute
sense, and you know,

00:30:11.443 --> 00:30:13.145 align:middle line:84%
and so I've had Jim
Norman, I think,

00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:15.881 align:middle line:84%
he's been on the Solari
Report as much as anybody

00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:19.285 align:middle line:84%
because he can sit down
and explain, "Look,

00:30:19.285 --> 00:30:20.753 align:middle line:90%
if I can hold the gap...

00:30:20.753 --> 00:30:25.057 align:middle line:84%
if I can develop the oil and
gas resources domestically

00:30:25.057 --> 00:30:28.894 align:middle line:84%
in North America and hold the
gas price at 3 or 4 dollars

00:30:28.894 --> 00:30:33.465 align:middle line:84%
when Europe is paying 8
and China is paying 15

00:30:33.465 --> 00:30:36.635 align:middle line:84%
and when the energy price
is 40% of manufacturing

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:39.805 align:middle line:84%
in the United States,
I can do, you know,

00:30:39.805 --> 00:30:43.208 align:middle line:84%
I can take the new fabrication
technology, the new 3D printing,

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:47.546 align:middle line:84%
all this kind of stuff and with
that subsidization of energy,

00:30:47.546 --> 00:30:51.283 align:middle line:84%
I can put US manufacturing
back in the game," you know,

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:54.987 align:middle line:84%
and it makes total sense, but
in the meantime if you're trying

00:30:54.987 --> 00:30:56.188 align:middle line:90%
to invest in oil and gas...

00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:58.123 align:middle line:84%
It makes no sense to
the outside world.

00:30:58.123 --> 00:31:00.793 align:middle line:84%
Right, but yet you as
an American citizen may

00:31:00.793 --> 00:31:04.663 align:middle line:84%
in fact be much better off if
they do this because, you know,

00:31:04.663 --> 00:31:06.432 align:middle line:84%
it's they're looking
economy-wide.

00:31:06.432 --> 00:31:07.833 align:middle line:90%
They're not...

00:31:07.833 --> 00:31:09.368 align:middle line:84%
Well, and we're all looking to
point our fingers at somebody

00:31:09.368 --> 00:31:11.403 align:middle line:84%
because things are
going very badly.

00:31:11.403 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] I mean, you know, the
reality is they're all bad guys,

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:84%
you know, and especially in
the conspiracy community,

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.812 align:middle line:84%
every single rock
that's overturned,

00:31:19.812 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
it's always the other
person's fault.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's funny
because I got very, you know,

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.153 align:middle line:84%
there's such a negativity
now on the Internet,

00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:31.623 align:middle line:84%
and I laugh at the
comments because I lived

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:35.894 align:middle line:84%
through the bailouts, and I
was adamant that we shouldn't,

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:39.098 align:middle line:84%
you know, that the bailouts
were a terrible idea.

00:31:39.098 --> 00:31:40.733 align:middle line:90%
I mean and we can go...

00:31:40.733 --> 00:31:42.434 align:middle line:90%
it's a much longer conversation,

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:44.536 align:middle line:84%
much more complex
issue, but I was a...

00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:46.105 align:middle line:90%
I have a great Congresswoman...

00:31:46.105 --> 00:31:49.475 align:middle line:84%
fabulous. I was in the phone to
her office every 5 minutes...

00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:84%
"Do not...", and she
voted against the bill.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.479 align:middle line:84%
That's why she's fabulous,
and, you know, " Do not..."

00:31:53.479 --> 00:31:56.448 align:middle line:84%
and finally they just stopped
taking our name and address

00:31:56.448 --> 00:31:59.351 align:middle line:84%
and were overwhelmed with
calls, "Do not do the bailouts."

00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:01.754 align:middle line:90%
So the message was very clear.

00:32:01.754 --> 00:32:06.058 align:middle line:84%
We do not want to be a
prisoner of "Too Big to Fail."

00:32:06.058 --> 00:32:08.627 align:middle line:84%
So there was a very
clear message to Congress

00:32:08.627 --> 00:32:11.497 align:middle line:84%
and to the regulators, "You've
got to come up with a way

00:32:11.497 --> 00:32:15.801 align:middle line:84%
to resolve and shrink the
banking sector without 'Too Big

00:32:15.801 --> 00:32:18.871 align:middle line:84%
To Fail.'" So regulators
went out and they came

00:32:18.871 --> 00:32:20.172 align:middle line:90%
up with plans to do it.

00:32:20.172 --> 00:32:22.808 align:middle line:90%
In December the Bank of England

00:32:22.808 --> 00:32:26.011 align:middle line:84%
and the Federal Reserve
published a paper saying, "Okay,

00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:27.479 align:middle line:84%
here's how we're
going to do it."

00:32:27.479 --> 00:32:29.615 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's kind of an
overview and a framework

00:32:29.615 --> 00:32:30.416 align:middle line:84%
for how they were
going to do it.

00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:31.817 align:middle line:90%
They're required by...

00:32:31.817 --> 00:32:33.919 align:middle line:84%
well, of course, all
these websites went nuts.

00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:35.387 align:middle line:90%
"Look at these guys.

00:32:35.387 --> 00:32:37.423 align:middle line:84%
They're ready to steal
our money," you know,

00:32:37.423 --> 00:32:39.458 align:middle line:84%
and it's like you
can't win for losing.

00:32:39.458 --> 00:32:41.126 align:middle line:90%
So, you know...

00:32:41.126 --> 00:32:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's true, and
conspiracies are bound right now

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:49.234 align:middle line:84%
because we're only two days
past the Boston Marathon event,

00:32:49.234 --> 00:32:52.638 align:middle line:84%
and so as an overview
even though this falls

00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:84%
in that category, is
there a correlation

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.811 align:middle line:84%
between terrorist events and
these markets and these doings

00:32:58.811 --> 00:33:00.446 align:middle line:90%
and also false flag events?

00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:02.514 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no, I assume...

00:33:02.514 --> 00:33:05.317 align:middle line:84%
I, you know, it's really funny
because you saw the price

00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:90%
of gold melting down on Monday.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.622 align:middle line:90%
So the Dow down, Dow, S&P's,

00:33:10.622 --> 00:33:12.958 align:middle line:84%
so the equity markets
really dropping,

00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:15.394 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly something
happens that just happens

00:33:15.394 --> 00:33:20.499 align:middle line:84%
to cut off telephone service and
other reports of cable service

00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:25.204 align:middle line:84%
to one of the largest areas of
equity management in the world.

00:33:25.204 --> 00:33:26.371 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Yeah, you know,

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:29.108 align:middle line:84%
so I immediately
assumed, oh, they're...

00:33:29.108 --> 00:33:30.709 align:middle line:90%
somebody's worried about...

00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:32.678 align:middle line:90%
False flag event.

00:33:32.678 --> 00:33:35.047 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, I would
say market intervention.

00:33:35.047 --> 00:33:36.281 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] A market
intervention.

00:33:36.281 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and it's for
something so horrific.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.319 align:middle line:84%
I mean, then, of course, you
know, it breaks your heart

00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:90%
because you have to look

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.622 align:middle line:84%
at the psychopathic
behavior in this case.

00:33:43.622 --> 00:33:45.691 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're looking at it
from a pragmatic point of view.

00:33:45.691 --> 00:33:48.393 align:middle line:84%
So you can see why they
might do what they do,

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:49.995 align:middle line:84%
but we're talking
about psychopaths.

00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, but the other thing is
it's not clear because in a lot

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.436 align:middle line:84%
of these situations
you have competition

00:33:57.436 --> 00:33:59.471 align:middle line:90%
between different factions.

00:33:59.471 --> 00:34:02.975 align:middle line:84%
So what you're watching is what
I call the Midianite thing.

00:34:02.975 --> 00:34:04.376 align:middle line:90%
There's a great...

00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:06.845 align:middle line:84%
my favorite story in the
Bible is the story of Gideon,

00:34:06.845 --> 00:34:12.117 align:middle line:84%
and Gideon comes down
the side of the mountain

00:34:12.117 --> 00:34:14.318 align:middle line:84%
with Gideon's army
that has no weapons.

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:16.988 align:middle line:84%
It's just lanterns and
they're making noise

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:20.325 align:middle line:84%
with slight vibration, and the
Midianites are so distrustful

00:34:20.325 --> 00:34:23.428 align:middle line:84%
of each other they jump up in
the valley and kill each other,

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you get
the Midianite thing

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.231 align:middle line:90%
where you have other, you know,

00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:28.633 align:middle line:84%
different factions
doing these things.

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:30.635 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very murky picture.

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:32.871 align:middle line:90%
Very murky indeed.

00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:36.742 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to bring that
up because of what was happening

00:34:36.742 --> 00:34:37.709 align:middle line:90%
in the financial markets on...

00:34:37.709 --> 00:34:39.044 align:middle line:90%
at the exact same time.

00:34:39.044 --> 00:34:42.747 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, a lot, I tend
to, you know, you asked me

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:47.052 align:middle line:84%
if I had read anything about
Boston, and I said, "No,"

00:34:47.052 --> 00:34:51.189 align:middle line:84%
because what I study is
the financial patterns.

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:54.258 align:middle line:84%
You know, I try and map out the
financial ecosystem around any

00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:57.062 align:middle line:84%
of these events, and
what you see if you map

00:34:57.062 --> 00:35:00.632 align:middle line:84%
out the financial ecosystem, it
tells a very different story,

00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:02.201 align:middle line:84%
and it tells a very
different story

00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:84%
than any either the
ulterior media

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.339 align:middle line:90%
or the corporate media tell.

00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:10.442 align:middle line:84%
So I tend not to
listen to much of that,

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:11.910 align:middle line:90%
and I look at the financials.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.346 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you an example.

00:35:14.346 --> 00:35:20.319 align:middle line:84%
About a week before the
Indonesian tsunami I had a

00:35:20.319 --> 00:35:24.957 align:middle line:84%
friend who bought a world
bond fund that had 15%

00:35:24.957 --> 00:35:28.193 align:middle line:84%
of the principle in
Indonesian sovereign debt.

00:35:28.193 --> 00:35:29.494 align:middle line:90%
It was about two weeks before,

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:32.798 align:middle line:84%
and the week before the
tsunami, it dropped overnight.

00:35:32.798 --> 00:35:34.233 align:middle line:90%
It was a closed in fund.

00:35:34.233 --> 00:35:38.437 align:middle line:84%
It dropped overnight 15% with
nothing going on in the market,

00:35:38.437 --> 00:35:41.607 align:middle line:84%
no change in interest rates,
no change in, you know,

00:35:41.607 --> 00:35:44.576 align:middle line:84%
just inexplicable, and it was
a very high quality sponsor,

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:47.779 align:middle line:84%
a very good company, and I've
never seen anything like it.

00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:48.847 align:middle line:90%
It made no sense.

00:35:48.847 --> 00:35:51.216 align:middle line:84%
It was one of these
baffling Orwellian,

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:53.952 align:middle line:84%
and we called the sponsor,
and we tried to figure it out.

00:35:53.952 --> 00:35:55.821 align:middle line:84%
We did research, and if
you looked at the selling,

00:35:55.821 --> 00:35:57.856 align:middle line:90%
there was massive sales.

00:35:57.856 --> 00:35:58.657 align:middle line:90%
I mean, massive.

00:35:58.657 --> 00:35:59.925 align:middle line:90%
A week before the tsunami.

00:35:59.925 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah and then the tsunami
happened, and it's amazing

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.498 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a very
positive person.

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:13.071 align:middle line:84%
I almost never get depressed,
and for a week after that I was

00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:18.577 align:middle line:84%
in a real depression because
I thought number 1, you know,

00:36:18.577 --> 00:36:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I live in a world where
someone could know a tsunami was

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.117 align:middle line:84%
happening a week from
now and not warn people.

00:36:25.117 --> 00:36:27.686 align:middle line:84%
That's number one,
but number two,

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:30.756 align:middle line:84%
I've got to help
people understand how

00:36:30.756 --> 00:36:35.661 align:middle line:84%
to protect their assets, and
how do you do that in a world

00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:36.962 align:middle line:90%
where people have that kind

00:36:36.962 --> 00:36:39.031 align:middle line:84%
of inside information
and you don't?

00:36:39.031 --> 00:36:43.268 align:middle line:84%
You know, I used to work at a
wonderful firm in Wall Street,

00:36:43.268 --> 00:36:45.938 align:middle line:84%
you know, and the chairman
would come in once a year

00:36:45.938 --> 00:36:47.339 align:middle line:84%
at our strategic
planning and say,

00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:49.875 align:middle line:84%
"Let me tell you what's going
to happen over the next year,"

00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:53.312 align:middle line:84%
you know, and you had some sense
of what was going to go down.

00:36:53.312 --> 00:36:55.347 align:middle line:84%
Now we're living in a
world where you can get hit

00:36:55.347 --> 00:36:58.450 align:middle line:84%
with wild cards from
any different direction,

00:36:58.450 --> 00:36:59.818 align:middle line:90%
and it was funny.

00:36:59.818 --> 00:37:02.854 align:middle line:84%
I started what I call a Solari
Circle, which is, you know,

00:37:02.854 --> 00:37:04.756 align:middle line:90%
it's a circle of people who...

00:37:04.756 --> 00:37:07.793 align:middle line:84%
it's either a financial action
club if you don't want to invest

00:37:07.793 --> 00:37:09.194 align:middle line:90%
or an investment club.

00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:12.297 align:middle line:84%
You can read all about it on my
website, but I called, you know,

00:37:12.297 --> 00:37:15.867 align:middle line:84%
10 of my favorite sort of
people, investors, and I said,

00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:19.137 align:middle line:84%
"You know, we have
to do a circle,"

00:37:19.137 --> 00:37:20.505 align:middle line:90%
and we did it through...

00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:22.674 align:middle line:84%
you can do it through person
or you can meet through phone,

00:37:22.674 --> 00:37:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "because I
can't be alone in this.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.479 align:middle line:90%
This is too lonely.

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:30.916 align:middle line:84%
I can't be smart
enough by myself.

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:33.985 align:middle line:84%
I can't be smart enough
with subscription services.

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:35.721 align:middle line:84%
I need a group of
real human beings

00:37:35.721 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:84%
to help me navigate
this environment.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.459 align:middle line:90%
So we need to do a circle."

00:37:40.459 --> 00:37:42.094 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] Yeah, I
mean, and actually

00:37:42.094 --> 00:37:44.529 align:middle line:84%
to have a really successful
circle I would think you would

00:37:44.529 --> 00:37:46.665 align:middle line:84%
need a very diverse
cast of characters.

00:37:46.665 --> 00:37:48.066 align:middle line:90%
Very diverse.

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:50.836 align:middle line:84%
Because as you speak about the
tsunami there was some esoteric

00:37:50.836 --> 00:37:52.938 align:middle line:90%
discussion way back then, too,

00:37:52.938 --> 00:37:55.474 align:middle line:84%
that you could certainly predict
it if you have the technology

00:37:55.474 --> 00:37:57.843 align:middle line:84%
to predict it to
create a tsunami.

00:37:57.843 --> 00:37:59.044 align:middle line:90%
Right. So there you go.

00:37:59.044 --> 00:38:01.747 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about it
goes so deep, so diverse,

00:38:01.747 --> 00:38:04.683 align:middle line:84%
and so do you have
a diverse circle?

00:38:04.683 --> 00:38:09.287 align:middle line:84%
What was interesting is we had
the circle operated for 7 years,

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:12.224 align:middle line:90%
and we just closed it down.

00:38:12.224 --> 00:38:15.861 align:middle line:84%
That circle we had each
person, we had 10 people,

00:38:15.861 --> 00:38:18.663 align:middle line:84%
each in a different state
all over the country,

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:20.599 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things we
would do is we would go

00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:24.236 align:middle line:84%
and we would do a report
on the economy as we saw it

00:38:24.236 --> 00:38:27.939 align:middle line:84%
on our day-to-day lives,
and you got a very robust,

00:38:27.939 --> 00:38:32.077 align:middle line:84%
unbelievably smart picture of
what was happening domestically

00:38:32.077 --> 00:38:36.248 align:middle line:84%
in the US economy that you
never got on the media,

00:38:36.248 --> 00:38:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and it was quite
remarkable, and you had people

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:42.821 align:middle line:84%
with very different backgrounds
and points of view, and in terms

00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:45.757 align:middle line:84%
of mapping the world and
understanding what was going on,

00:38:45.757 --> 00:38:48.994 align:middle line:84%
it was not only unbelievably
useful,

00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:52.397 align:middle line:84%
but it was very energizing
in the sense

00:38:52.397 --> 00:38:55.100 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't feel
alone and you didn't feel

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.303 align:middle line:84%
like you were a prisoner of
the Orwellian puzzle palace.

00:38:58.303 --> 00:38:59.704 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:02.741 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was a way of
breaking through the matrix.

00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:05.477 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And it worked, but
it required, you know,

00:39:05.477 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:84%
when I end the Solari Report,
every time I say it I say,

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.183 align:middle line:84%
"Don't worry about whether
there is a conspiracy.

00:39:11.183 --> 00:39:13.084 align:middle line:84%
If you're not in one,
you need to start one."

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:14.486 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] No truly.

00:39:14.486 --> 00:39:15.587 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:39:15.587 --> 00:39:16.922 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is true.

00:39:16.922 --> 00:39:19.858 align:middle line:84%
This conspiracy word has always
been a strange word for me

00:39:19.858 --> 00:39:23.094 align:middle line:84%
because I grew up in a world
where everyone was organized

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and operated around
conspiracies.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:28.166 align:middle line:84%
Now that didn't mean they
were illegal but, you know,

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:31.002 align:middle line:84%
some were legal, some were
illegal, but, you know,

00:39:31.002 --> 00:39:33.605 align:middle line:84%
you got together, you made a
plan, and then you snuck around

00:39:33.605 --> 00:39:34.806 align:middle line:90%
and you implemented it.

00:39:34.806 --> 00:39:36.675 align:middle line:84%
Right. And when I was in
Wall Street there was this

00:39:36.675 --> 00:39:38.043 align:middle line:90%
wonderful guy.

00:39:38.043 --> 00:39:40.178 align:middle line:84%
He was a chief of staff to one
of the big media companies,

00:39:40.178 --> 00:39:43.181 align:middle line:84%
and he had been in government,
and we were both very interested

00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:45.951 align:middle line:84%
in sort of civic life,
and he would call me up,

00:39:45.951 --> 00:39:47.752 align:middle line:84%
and he would say, "Look, these
guys are getting together

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:49.354 align:middle line:84%
and doing this thing
that's terrible,

00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:50.856 align:middle line:90%
and it's bad for the city."

00:39:50.856 --> 00:39:52.057 align:middle line:90%
We loved the city.

00:39:52.057 --> 00:39:53.058 align:middle line:90%
"It's bad for the city.

00:39:53.058 --> 00:39:55.627 align:middle line:84%
So I suggest we conspire
and stop them."

00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:56.294 align:middle line:90%
It was like a game.

00:39:56.294 --> 00:39:57.696 align:middle line:90%
That's a conspiracy.

00:39:57.696 --> 00:40:00.565 align:middle line:84%
It was like a sport, yeah, and
that's a conspiracy, you know,

00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:04.469 align:middle line:84%
and to me that was
the operating...

00:40:04.469 --> 00:40:06.471 align:middle line:90%
that's how you got things done.

00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:09.808 align:middle line:84%
So to me conspiracies was
just the way the world worked,

00:40:09.808 --> 00:40:12.744 align:middle line:84%
and then when I ended up
in the situation of sort

00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:16.848 align:middle line:84%
of going public and everybody
started talking conspiracies

00:40:16.848 --> 00:40:20.452 align:middle line:84%
like they were a bad thing or
an unusual thing, and I said,

00:40:20.452 --> 00:40:23.788 align:middle line:84%
"You know, you have been
brainwashed to believe...

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:25.490 align:middle line:84%
you know, you've
been brainwashed

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:29.027 align:middle line:84%
to become a person who's
incapable of organizing

00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and effecting conspiracies, and
what you need to do is you need

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.565 align:middle line:90%
to not yell at them about yours.

00:40:33.565 --> 00:40:36.201 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do
is all conspire

00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:39.538 align:middle line:84%
to create a wealth building
decentralized economy."

00:40:39.538 --> 00:40:40.939 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Here, here.

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:43.208 align:middle line:84%
Yes. You know, and the way to
do it is to make money doing it.

00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:45.544 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I come from a
world where, you know,

00:40:45.544 --> 00:40:48.813 align:middle line:84%
when the top guys decided
they wanted to go to Rome,

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.081 align:middle line:84%
they didn't say,
"Let's go to Rome."

00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:52.284 align:middle line:84%
They said, "How do we
engineer the system

00:40:52.284 --> 00:40:54.519 align:middle line:84%
so everybody can make
money going to Rome?"

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:55.921 align:middle line:84%
You know, and then
you engineer it

00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:58.924 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly everybody
starts going to Rome

00:40:58.924 --> 00:41:00.325 align:middle line:90%
because that makes the money.

00:41:00.325 --> 00:41:05.197 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so how do we engineer
helping each other all making

00:41:05.197 --> 00:41:09.000 align:middle line:84%
money, building wealth
building, decentralized economy

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.437 align:middle line:84%
that can invite these guys
out of the psychopathic model

00:41:12.437 --> 00:41:15.407 align:middle line:84%
and into, you know, something
a little bit more, you know,

00:41:15.407 --> 00:41:16.808 align:middle line:90%
amusing for [inaudible].

00:41:16.808 --> 00:41:20.078 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] And profitable, and
that's what you're working on.

00:41:20.078 --> 00:41:21.913 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about...

00:41:21.913 --> 00:41:25.483 align:middle line:84%
when we get just a little
further in the conversation,

00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:27.018 align:middle line:84%
one more thing I want to
talk about, I would like you

00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:30.522 align:middle line:84%
to explain how you do that and
how you're advising people now,

00:41:30.522 --> 00:41:31.990 align:middle line:84%
but I have one more thing
I want to talk about.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.559 align:middle line:84%
It's a personal bone to pick,
but millions and millions

00:41:34.559 --> 00:41:35.827 align:middle line:90%
of people are going through it.

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:37.262 align:middle line:90%
We just went through the process

00:41:37.262 --> 00:41:39.264 align:middle line:84%
of obtaining a conventional
loan,

00:41:39.264 --> 00:41:41.533 align:middle line:84%
but there was nothing
conventional

00:41:41.533 --> 00:41:43.435 align:middle line:84%
about the process
[laughter] of getting a loan.

00:41:43.435 --> 00:41:45.237 align:middle line:90%
It was horrifying.

00:41:45.237 --> 00:41:48.206 align:middle line:84%
At first Bank of
America, who we've banked

00:41:48.206 --> 00:41:52.811 align:middle line:84%
with for a long time, and
another bank that's a cool,

00:41:52.811 --> 00:41:55.180 align:middle line:84%
small bank, but nonetheless
turned to Bank of America

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.617 align:middle line:84%
and thought, "Well, you
know, you're our ally here."

00:41:58.617 --> 00:42:00.452 align:middle line:90%
They said, "Oh, interesting.

00:42:00.452 --> 00:42:03.922 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can give you 40%
against personal assets,"

00:42:03.922 --> 00:42:04.689 align:middle line:90%
and I said, "No, no, no, no.

00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:06.324 align:middle line:90%
This is a home mortgage.

00:42:06.324 --> 00:42:07.993 align:middle line:90%
No we don't really need...

00:42:07.993 --> 00:42:10.729 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to use the home
as a collateral," and I thought,

00:42:10.729 --> 00:42:11.563 align:middle line:90%
"You've got to be kidding."

00:42:11.563 --> 00:42:13.465 align:middle line:90%
Well I fled from that situation.

00:42:13.465 --> 00:42:16.768 align:middle line:84%
I found a very creative,
powerful mortgage broker

00:42:16.768 --> 00:42:20.939 align:middle line:84%
who put us with someone else,
but what we had to go through.

00:42:20.939 --> 00:42:24.409 align:middle line:84%
Right. The disclosure
is horribly invasive.

00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:26.911 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just horribly invasive.

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:28.847 align:middle line:84%
The procedures now
are frightening.

00:42:28.847 --> 00:42:31.349 align:middle line:84%
You know one of the things that
frightens me about these kinds

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:34.152 align:middle line:84%
of documentation is, you
know, you're signing things,

00:42:34.152 --> 00:42:37.922 align:middle line:84%
and if there's any technical
misrepresentation and cliffs,

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:39.491 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's jail time.

00:42:39.491 --> 00:42:40.692 align:middle line:90%
It's dangerous.

00:42:40.692 --> 00:42:42.827 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
very impeccable.

00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:45.897 align:middle line:84%
You have to give up frightening
disclosure because if you look

00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:49.401 align:middle line:84%
at where that data is going
into, it's not, you know,

00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:50.702 align:middle line:90%
it's not any place so wonderful.

00:42:50.702 --> 00:42:53.171 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know every
deposit, who it came from,

00:42:53.171 --> 00:42:54.639 align:middle line:90%
why they wrote the check to us.

00:42:54.639 --> 00:42:56.841 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the disclosure
part was horrifying,

00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:59.411 align:middle line:84%
and I assume that's data
mining and whatever else.

00:42:59.411 --> 00:43:03.181 align:middle line:84%
Right, and the other
thing is that if you look

00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:07.218 align:middle line:84%
at the financial requirements
such as loan to value,

00:43:07.218 --> 00:43:09.954 align:middle line:84%
it's clear that an
effort is being made

00:43:09.954 --> 00:43:12.223 align:middle line:84%
to shut off credit
to Main Street.

00:43:12.223 --> 00:43:14.292 align:middle line:84%
That is what I finally
determined, and I talked

00:43:14.292 --> 00:43:16.294 align:middle line:84%
to some people in the
banking industry about it.

00:43:16.294 --> 00:43:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Another thing, which
I'll get to in a moment,

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:20.298 align:middle line:84%
but another thing
is the house had

00:43:20.298 --> 00:43:22.734 align:middle line:84%
to meet certain HUD
standards, for example,

00:43:22.734 --> 00:43:23.802 align:middle line:90%
and that's not a HUD loan.

00:43:23.802 --> 00:43:24.869 align:middle line:90%
This isn't a government loan.

00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:26.371 align:middle line:90%
It's a private loan.

00:43:26.371 --> 00:43:27.739 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:43:27.739 --> 00:43:30.342 align:middle line:84%
Although in every realistic
closing you have HUD documents

00:43:30.342 --> 00:43:31.676 align:middle line:90%
that go into the HUD database.

00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So HUD is present in every
real estate transaction whether

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.551 align:middle line:84%
private or government
insurance or finance related.

00:43:39.551 --> 00:43:41.186 align:middle line:90%
Okay, and what about the notion

00:43:41.186 --> 00:43:43.755 align:middle line:84%
that the house had already
appraised at a certain value,

00:43:43.755 --> 00:43:47.158 align:middle line:84%
which we were buying it
at, and they said, "Oh, no,

00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:84%
we've just done another
inspection

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.928 align:middle line:90%
on it, and, yes, it's true.

00:43:49.928 --> 00:43:53.131 align:middle line:84%
It does appraise at that, but
you need to fix this, this,

00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:55.667 align:middle line:84%
and this," and this was
huge-the knocking out a wall,

00:43:55.667 --> 00:43:58.837 align:middle line:84%
fixing the external
stucco, fixing the roof,

00:43:58.837 --> 00:44:01.172 align:middle line:84%
all these different things,
and we had 3 days to complete

00:44:01.172 --> 00:44:02.373 align:middle line:90%
that before the closing escrow.

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:05.143 align:middle line:84%
Now that is one I
haven't heard a lot about.

00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:05.844 align:middle line:90%
That's a little...

00:44:05.844 --> 00:44:06.845 align:middle line:90%
We didn't own the home.

00:44:06.845 --> 00:44:07.612 align:middle line:84%
We had to get permission
from the owner

00:44:07.612 --> 00:44:08.747 align:middle line:90%
of the home to even do it.

00:44:08.747 --> 00:44:09.848 align:middle line:90%
So they did that.

00:44:09.848 --> 00:44:12.684 align:middle line:84%
So as I was looking
at it every which way,

00:44:12.684 --> 00:44:15.320 align:middle line:90%
I saw that a, the bank...

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.688 align:middle line:90%
this was a short sell.

00:44:16.688 --> 00:44:19.624 align:middle line:84%
The bank that was selling
the house had no motivation

00:44:19.624 --> 00:44:20.892 align:middle line:90%
to sell it.

00:44:20.892 --> 00:44:22.927 align:middle line:84%
The bank that was loaning
us the money had it seemed

00:44:22.927 --> 00:44:27.599 align:middle line:84%
to be equally little
motivation to loan us the money,

00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and so I had a conversation
with the...

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.938 align:middle line:84%
Right because remember
how the system works.

00:44:33.938 --> 00:44:38.109 align:middle line:84%
If I want to shut off credit
to Main Street, I can just put

00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:39.544 align:middle line:90%
out an order-shut off credit.

00:44:39.544 --> 00:44:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. But that's
a political problem.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:48.086 align:middle line:84%
So what I can also do is I can
create 27 different steps you

00:44:48.086 --> 00:44:52.357 align:middle line:84%
have to go through to make
it complex and nightmarish

00:44:52.357 --> 00:44:54.192 align:middle line:90%
and expensive for you to borrow,

00:44:54.192 --> 00:44:56.261 align:middle line:84%
and then I don't
shut off credit.

00:44:56.261 --> 00:44:59.931 align:middle line:84%
It's just as a practical
matter, I get the same results.

00:44:59.931 --> 00:45:03.134 align:middle line:84%
Because the first 3 people
trying to buy the house fell

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:06.271 align:middle line:84%
out of escrow because they
basically flipped the bird

00:45:06.271 --> 00:45:08.106 align:middle line:84%
to the financial
institutions and said,

00:45:08.106 --> 00:45:09.073 align:middle line:84%
"We're not putting
up with this."

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.608 align:middle line:84%
They were not as
motivated as I was.

00:45:10.608 --> 00:45:13.645 align:middle line:90%
Right. So we've seen if you look

00:45:13.645 --> 00:45:16.815 align:middle line:84%
at the bank regulation that's
happening locally particularly

00:45:16.815 --> 00:45:19.751 align:middle line:84%
to the local and regional
banks, and if you look

00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:22.921 align:middle line:84%
at the what's happening
with the kind

00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:24.722 align:middle line:84%
of mortgage markets
you're talking about,

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:27.258 align:middle line:84%
what we're seeing is
the government needs

00:45:27.258 --> 00:45:28.560 align:middle line:90%
to borrow money.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.462 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need competition
from the private sector.

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:34.065 align:middle line:84%
That runs the danger of
running up the interest rates.

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:36.568 align:middle line:84%
So to the extent that
you can shut off credit

00:45:36.568 --> 00:45:40.238 align:middle line:84%
and you can shut off liquidity
to Main Street, you're going

00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:43.208 align:middle line:84%
to keep a lid on interest rates,
and you're going to keep a lid

00:45:43.208 --> 00:45:44.709 align:middle line:90%
on inflation, and what

00:45:44.709 --> 00:45:47.612 align:middle line:84%
that means is the economy's
going to slow down, and...

00:45:47.612 --> 00:45:49.581 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, they're talking about,
"Oh, no, the market's back."

00:45:49.581 --> 00:45:52.350 align:middle line:84%
No it can't be under these
conditions and I did speak

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.185 align:middle line:84%
to the manager of
what is considered one

00:45:54.185 --> 00:45:57.355 align:middle line:84%
of the top 10 safest banks
in America, family owned,

00:45:57.355 --> 00:45:59.591 align:middle line:84%
never did a scummy
deal, they were audited.

00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:00.792 align:middle line:90%
He tried to get a loan.

00:46:00.792 --> 00:46:03.428 align:middle line:84%
They put him through that,
but he was then audited.

00:46:03.428 --> 00:46:06.998 align:middle line:84%
The bank was audited, and the
young pups that came around

00:46:06.998 --> 00:46:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and audited them said, "Why
are you making these loans,

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.635 align:middle line:90%
these home loans to people?"

00:46:10.635 --> 00:46:11.936 align:middle line:90%
And they suggested on the way

00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:14.072 align:middle line:84%
out even though they
showed no losses,

00:46:14.072 --> 00:46:17.141 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't be making
these loans, you know.

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:18.509 align:middle line:90%
That was their recommendation.

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:20.478 align:middle line:84%
Because then if you don't make
those loans, that money goes

00:46:20.478 --> 00:46:22.981 align:middle line:84%
in the investment portfolio,
and you buy Fannie and Freddie's

00:46:22.981 --> 00:46:24.249 align:middle line:90%
and government securities.

00:46:24.249 --> 00:46:26.918 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. So the investment
portfolio's going up, up,

00:46:26.918 --> 00:46:31.556 align:middle line:84%
up and it's the competition
for low cost of capital

00:46:31.556 --> 00:46:35.126 align:middle line:84%
because what you're trying
to do is you're trying

00:46:35.126 --> 00:46:38.196 align:middle line:84%
to borrow all the
retail deposits

00:46:38.196 --> 00:46:40.598 align:middle line:90%
at the lowest dollar possible.

00:46:40.598 --> 00:46:45.036 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm the government and I
need to borrow that money to,

00:46:45.036 --> 00:46:48.039 align:middle line:84%
you know, to keep the
game going and I want

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:49.340 align:middle line:90%
to pay low interest rates,

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.077 align:middle line:84%
the more I can make my
securities the only game

00:46:53.077 --> 00:46:56.014 align:middle line:84%
in town, the easier it is
to scarf up the deposits

00:46:56.014 --> 00:46:58.283 align:middle line:84%
from Main Street
and not, you know,

00:46:58.283 --> 00:47:00.952 align:middle line:84%
and have that money circulate
inside my hydraulic pumping

00:47:00.952 --> 00:47:03.688 align:middle line:84%
system, and not back
out onto Main Street.

00:47:03.688 --> 00:47:07.358 align:middle line:84%
So when the news headlines say,
"Oh, it appears the market...

00:47:07.358 --> 00:47:10.528 align:middle line:84%
the housing market is
recovering," that can't be.

00:47:10.528 --> 00:47:12.897 align:middle line:84%
Can it be under these
conditions?

00:47:12.897 --> 00:47:15.500 align:middle line:90%
The housing market is recovering

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.936 align:middle line:84%
in nominal dollars
in some places.

00:47:17.936 --> 00:47:21.306 align:middle line:84%
We have a tremendous
divergence in the economy.

00:47:21.306 --> 00:47:24.976 align:middle line:84%
So I live in a very poor county
that's really struggling.

00:47:24.976 --> 00:47:28.446 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the areas where
you have industry that's strong,

00:47:28.446 --> 00:47:31.683 align:middle line:84%
so you go to North Dakota where
you have a big oil and gas,

00:47:31.683 --> 00:47:33.451 align:middle line:84%
you know, development of
the oil and gas deposits.

00:47:33.451 --> 00:47:35.653 align:middle line:90%
If you go to Texas, same thing.

00:47:35.653 --> 00:47:38.890 align:middle line:84%
If you go out to Silicon Valley
where the tech, you know,

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.793 align:middle line:84%
and the entrepreneurship
is high, so any place

00:47:41.793 --> 00:47:45.163 align:middle line:84%
where the economy is strong,
you're seeing tremendous amounts

00:47:45.163 --> 00:47:48.066 align:middle line:84%
of money come in from
institutional investments.

00:47:48.066 --> 00:47:51.703 align:middle line:84%
So we have big hedge funds
announcing that they own...

00:47:51.703 --> 00:47:54.072 align:middle line:84%
you know, that they've
bought 16,000 units all

00:47:54.072 --> 00:47:54.739 align:middle line:90%
over the country...

00:47:54.739 --> 00:47:55.807 align:middle line:90%
I see. Yeah.

00:47:55.807 --> 00:47:57.141 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
securitize them up,

00:47:57.141 --> 00:47:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and the sad thing is they're
going to securitize them up

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.245 align:middle line:84%
and sell the securities
back to the very people

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.313 align:middle line:84%
that got thrown out
of these houses.

00:48:02.313 --> 00:48:03.648 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
very sad, but...

00:48:03.648 --> 00:48:06.751 align:middle line:84%
Very sad. So you have
both from offshore

00:48:06.751 --> 00:48:12.023 align:middle line:84%
and the institutional money a
lot of cash buyers moving in.

00:48:12.023 --> 00:48:13.291 align:middle line:90%
So you do...

00:48:13.291 --> 00:48:16.127 align:middle line:84%
But this doesn't really
effect the average US citizen,

00:48:16.127 --> 00:48:17.195 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:48:17.195 --> 00:48:18.329 align:middle line:84%
You're a teacher or
whatnot for a living

00:48:18.329 --> 00:48:19.797 align:middle line:84%
who is just trying
to buy a house.

00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:21.165 align:middle line:90%
Think of it this way.

00:48:21.165 --> 00:48:23.468 align:middle line:84%
We have a world that's dying
and a world that's being born.

00:48:23.468 --> 00:48:26.371 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And part of what the
financial coup de etat was

00:48:26.371 --> 00:48:29.240 align:middle line:84%
about was sucking capital
out of the world that's dying

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.075 align:middle line:84%
and moving it into the
world that's being born.

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:34.645 align:middle line:84%
The problem is you changed
ownership of who owned it,

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:37.515 align:middle line:84%
you know, but, you know,
what each one of us has

00:48:37.515 --> 00:48:39.784 align:middle line:84%
to do is find a way to migrate
ourselves and our assets

00:48:39.784 --> 00:48:40.952 align:middle line:90%
out of other world that's dying

00:48:40.952 --> 00:48:42.787 align:middle line:84%
and into the world
that's being born,

00:48:42.787 --> 00:48:44.655 align:middle line:84%
and some people have
been nimble about it,

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:49.494 align:middle line:84%
and some people haven't, and,
you know, and there are parts

00:48:49.494 --> 00:48:52.330 align:middle line:84%
of that which are very much
engineered politically,

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:53.998 align:middle line:84%
but there are other parts
of it that have just

00:48:53.998 --> 00:48:55.299 align:middle line:90%
to do with technology.

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:57.068 align:middle line:84%
Right. So we're seeing,
for example,

00:48:57.068 --> 00:49:00.405 align:middle line:84%
enormous developments
in robotics.

00:49:00.405 --> 00:49:02.874 align:middle line:84%
We just had a firm out in
Silicon Valley come out and say,

00:49:02.874 --> 00:49:06.811 align:middle line:84%
"Look, our new robot can
replace anybody who's grilling

00:49:06.811 --> 00:49:09.080 align:middle line:90%
or packaging a hamburger.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, and the, and we can
save the fast food industry 16

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:13.317 align:middle line:90%
billion dollars."

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:17.622 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's 16 billion
dollars of minimum wage jobs.

00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:18.956 align:middle line:90%
What those people going to...

00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:20.758 align:middle line:90%
Right. And there is that.

00:49:20.758 --> 00:49:22.927 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your new world.

00:49:22.927 --> 00:49:26.631 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so if we have to give
birth to a new world, a sound,

00:49:26.631 --> 00:49:29.233 align:middle line:84%
economic, holistic
world, what...

00:49:29.233 --> 00:49:32.804 align:middle line:84%
how are you structuring
things on behalf of your...

00:49:32.804 --> 00:49:34.672 align:middle line:90%
the people that you're advising?

00:49:34.672 --> 00:49:36.174 align:middle line:90%
And, in general, what kind

00:49:36.174 --> 00:49:39.544 align:middle line:84%
of advice are you giving
to people at large?

00:49:39.544 --> 00:49:40.545 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a little bit...

00:49:40.545 --> 00:49:42.146 align:middle line:84%
a vision of what
that world would look

00:49:42.146 --> 00:49:45.850 align:middle line:84%
like is a little bit different
than what one individual can do

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.019 align:middle line:84%
because what one
individual can do depends

00:49:48.019 --> 00:49:49.387 align:middle line:90%
on what lots of people do.

00:49:49.387 --> 00:49:51.756 align:middle line:84%
So... So let's talk about
your new ideal world

00:49:51.756 --> 00:49:52.890 align:middle line:90%
that we can move into.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:56.561 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so my ideal world
is one where we have...

00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:57.795 align:middle line:90%
we don't have a one-way mirror.

00:49:57.795 --> 00:50:00.398 align:middle line:90%
We have real transparency, okay.

00:50:00.398 --> 00:50:03.167 align:middle line:84%
So there's a balance of power
in terms of knowledge and data

00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:07.672 align:middle line:84%
between any individual and the
people governing and managing,

00:50:07.672 --> 00:50:13.277 align:middle line:84%
but in a way which is
geopolitically even, okay,

00:50:13.277 --> 00:50:17.081 align:middle line:84%
because part of this is we're
rebalancing the global economy.

00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:18.683 align:middle line:90%
So I think there's a...

00:50:18.683 --> 00:50:20.818 align:middle line:84%
we get out of the world
of one-way mirror,

00:50:20.818 --> 00:50:22.487 align:middle line:84%
and we get into a
world of sunshine.

00:50:22.487 --> 00:50:24.021 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:24.856 align:middle line:90%
When the...

00:50:24.856 --> 00:50:25.757 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's a...

00:50:25.757 --> 00:50:27.625 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:50:27.625 --> 00:50:30.528 align:middle line:84%
Well I think you do that
one house, one person,

00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:32.897 align:middle line:84%
one household, and one
neighborhood at a time.

00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:35.166 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
one of the things

00:50:35.166 --> 00:50:37.635 align:middle line:84%
if the first thing I will
talk with an individual

00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:41.806 align:middle line:84%
about is they want to know what
can I do, and this is very much

00:50:41.806 --> 00:50:43.841 align:middle line:90%
like a health program.

00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:44.909 align:middle line:84%
You know, the first
thing you want

00:50:44.909 --> 00:50:46.644 align:middle line:90%
to do is you want to detox...

00:50:46.644 --> 00:50:49.013 align:middle line:84%
Right. [Laughter]
You know, I like...

00:50:49.013 --> 00:50:52.850 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I liken the global
financial system to a tapeworm,

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:56.254 align:middle line:84%
and the way a tapeworm works
in your body is it ejects

00:50:56.254 --> 00:50:58.923 align:middle line:84%
into you a chemical that
makes you crave what's good

00:50:58.923 --> 00:51:01.225 align:middle line:84%
for the tapeworm
and bad for you.

00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:03.528 align:middle line:90%
So we take in the chemical,

00:51:03.528 --> 00:51:05.196 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing you know
we're feeding the tapeworm,

00:51:05.196 --> 00:51:08.166 align:middle line:84%
and if you look at many
family's income statement

00:51:08.166 --> 00:51:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and balance sheet, you know,
they're hooked, but it's not...

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.605 align:middle line:84%
you know, nobody's putting
a gun to their head.

00:51:14.605 --> 00:51:16.641 align:middle line:90%
They're buying into the game.

00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:18.476 align:middle line:84%
So they're listening
to the corporate media,

00:51:18.476 --> 00:51:20.978 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing you
know they're going out

00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:23.114 align:middle line:84%
and eating food that makes
them sick, and they're dying,

00:51:23.114 --> 00:51:24.248 align:middle line:90%
and then they're, you know,

00:51:24.248 --> 00:51:26.951 align:middle line:84%
they're on the health
treadmill and, you know,

00:51:26.951 --> 00:51:29.854 align:middle line:84%
all their money's going for a
variety of health [inaudible].

00:51:29.854 --> 00:51:31.589 align:middle line:90%
So they're getting harvested,

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:34.458 align:middle line:84%
but they have the
power to say no.

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:37.061 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm going to get
the tapeworm out of my mind.

00:51:37.061 --> 00:51:37.762 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get...

00:51:37.762 --> 00:51:38.796 align:middle line:90%
I'm going...

00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:41.699 align:middle line:84%
So step number one
is we need to detox.

00:51:41.699 --> 00:51:43.734 align:middle line:84%
Then the second thing
we need to do is we need

00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:48.105 align:middle line:84%
to build our immunity
from being harvested.

00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:50.575 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
in financial terms

00:51:50.575 --> 00:51:53.678 align:middle line:84%
as we've seen this
tremendous printing

00:51:53.678 --> 00:51:58.516 align:middle line:84%
of our very expansionary money
supply and fiscal policy,

00:51:58.516 --> 00:52:01.185 align:middle line:84%
we've seen the value
of the currencies drop,

00:52:01.185 --> 00:52:02.520 align:middle line:90%
and that's this, you know,

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.455 align:middle line:84%
what's driven the
price of gold up.

00:52:04.455 --> 00:52:06.324 align:middle line:90%
I call that debasement,

00:52:06.324 --> 00:52:09.227 align:middle line:84%
and debasement is
more than just money.

00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:10.461 align:middle line:90%
I go to the store, the can

00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:13.598 align:middle line:84%
of tuna fish now
costs twice as much.

00:52:13.598 --> 00:52:15.967 align:middle line:90%
The size of the can is 20% less.

00:52:15.967 --> 00:52:17.268 align:middle line:90%
Exactly. Yeah.

00:52:17.268 --> 00:52:19.337 align:middle line:84%
And there's a 10% greater
chance I'm going to get sick

00:52:19.337 --> 00:52:22.707 align:middle line:84%
from eating it because the
quality has diminished in ways,

00:52:22.707 --> 00:52:24.775 align:middle line:90%
which are very invisible to me.

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:28.179 align:middle line:84%
So debasement is a
much deeper issue,

00:52:28.179 --> 00:52:30.781 align:middle line:90%
but I'm living with debasement.

00:52:30.781 --> 00:52:35.419 align:middle line:84%
So part of this is
building my immune system,

00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:38.356 align:middle line:84%
understanding what's
going on, and learn how

00:52:38.356 --> 00:52:40.891 align:middle line:90%
to navigate protecting myself.

00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:45.329 align:middle line:84%
So it's very simple-detox,
build immunity, and then proceed

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:47.898 align:middle line:84%
as you do to navigate from
the world that's dying

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:51.035 align:middle line:84%
to the world that's being
born, and part of doing that,

00:52:51.035 --> 00:52:53.904 align:middle line:84%
and this really gets down to a
very spiritual deep question,

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:57.675 align:middle line:84%
is we all have to get out of
the business of making money

00:52:57.675 --> 00:53:01.946 align:middle line:84%
by doing things that harm other
people and get into the business

00:53:01.946 --> 00:53:04.849 align:middle line:84%
of making money by doing
something that's useful.

00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:07.451 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if you
look at what you do,

00:53:07.451 --> 00:53:11.322 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing is you're
helping people understand how

00:53:11.322 --> 00:53:12.523 align:middle line:90%
things work.

00:53:12.523 --> 00:53:14.859 align:middle line:90%
Okay? That is so powerful

00:53:14.859 --> 00:53:17.094 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
protect your health

00:53:17.094 --> 00:53:18.663 align:middle line:84%
of your money unless
you can navigate...

00:53:18.663 --> 00:53:20.331 align:middle line:90%
unless you have a map, okay?

00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:23.868 align:middle line:84%
So you found a way
to use your time.

00:53:23.868 --> 00:53:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Your career is trying
to help people get

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.139 align:middle line:90%
from here to there, okay?

00:53:28.139 --> 00:53:30.508 align:middle line:84%
So you're not in the business
of engineering genocide.

00:53:30.508 --> 00:53:33.077 align:middle line:84%
You're in the business of
helping people get out of it.

00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so we all have to do
that, and I'm sure you know,

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.316 align:middle line:84%
getting from one to the
other is a big process.

00:53:38.316 --> 00:53:39.884 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are sacrifices
along the way.

00:53:39.884 --> 00:53:41.018 align:middle line:90%
Right. Right.

00:53:41.018 --> 00:53:43.788 align:middle line:84%
The more of us who do
it, the easier it is.

00:53:43.788 --> 00:53:49.794 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And the, you know, the most
terrifying thing to look at is

00:53:51.062 --> 00:53:56.033 align:middle line:84%
so many of us are working
in industries and in jobs

00:53:56.033 --> 00:53:58.102 align:middle line:84%
where we're making
things worse not better.

00:53:58.102 --> 00:54:01.472 align:middle line:84%
If we really look down,
you know, it's funny.

00:54:01.472 --> 00:54:03.607 align:middle line:84%
When I first tried to
really dig in and try

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:06.410 align:middle line:84%
to understand the mortgage
fraud, the hardest thing for me

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:09.947 align:middle line:84%
to do was to realize that I had
been the Assistant Secretary

00:54:09.947 --> 00:54:11.382 align:middle line:84%
of Housing, and that
had been going

00:54:11.382 --> 00:54:15.753 align:middle line:84%
on within my operation,
and I hadn't seen it.

00:54:15.753 --> 00:54:18.556 align:middle line:84%
I had not seen it, and,
you know, I had to look

00:54:18.556 --> 00:54:20.358 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror and do what
many of us did, you know,

00:54:20.358 --> 00:54:22.626 align:middle line:90%
and say, "Oh, I'm the patsy.

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:23.828 align:middle line:90%
I'm the patsy."

00:54:23.828 --> 00:54:25.830 align:middle line:90%
That's a very painful process.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.531 align:middle line:84%
We all have to go
through that process.

00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:29.633 align:middle line:90%
I call it coming clean.

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:34.739 align:middle line:84%
So if I can come clean in
my own life and reposition

00:54:34.739 --> 00:54:38.642 align:middle line:84%
in the ways we just described,
the more of us who do that,

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:42.113 align:middle line:84%
then the more of a market there
is for the rest of us, you know,

00:54:42.113 --> 00:54:43.881 align:middle line:90%
to move into this new world.

00:54:43.881 --> 00:54:45.449 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
bit uncomfortable.

00:54:45.449 --> 00:54:47.918 align:middle line:84%
If everybody's doing the
waltz, it's difficult

00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:49.353 align:middle line:90%
to start doing the tango.

00:54:49.353 --> 00:54:52.223 align:middle line:84%
Right. But the more of us
who do, the more energy

00:54:52.223 --> 00:54:53.424 align:middle line:90%
and momentum there is,

00:54:53.424 --> 00:54:54.759 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
all trying to figure out.

00:54:54.759 --> 00:54:56.494 align:middle line:90%
How do we do it together?

00:54:56.494 --> 00:54:58.996 align:middle line:84%
Well, and, you know, when
I see people who are,

00:54:58.996 --> 00:55:02.333 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know what to do,
my career's gone, you know,

00:55:02.333 --> 00:55:05.236 align:middle line:84%
I've lost my job, or
whatnot, a lot of people have,

00:55:05.236 --> 00:55:09.373 align:middle line:84%
and the one thing that keeps
coming to me is that thing

00:55:09.373 --> 00:55:11.776 align:middle line:84%
that matters to you that you
really love, even though...

00:55:11.776 --> 00:55:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Your deepest desire.

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:13.811 align:middle line:90%
Your deepest desire.

00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:16.580 align:middle line:84%
You may not have anything
apparent supporting it.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.984 align:middle line:84%
Do what you have to do
but start that thing now.

00:55:19.984 --> 00:55:21.352 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happened to me.

00:55:21.352 --> 00:55:23.821 align:middle line:90%
My process was very typical.

00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:27.091 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting in Washington
in 1997.

00:55:27.091 --> 00:55:30.828 align:middle line:84%
I professionally and personally
I have an overhead, you know,

00:55:30.828 --> 00:55:35.199 align:middle line:84%
revenues of about a million
dollars a month and expenses

00:55:35.199 --> 00:55:37.701 align:middle line:84%
of less that, but
certainly high, you know,

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly everything
stops-all credit,

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:41.205 align:middle line:90%
all cash flows.

00:55:41.205 --> 00:55:44.108 align:middle line:84%
And I had to within a
reasonable period of time get

00:55:44.108 --> 00:55:48.512 align:middle line:84%
down to $2,000 a month but
still supply all the compliance

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:51.782 align:middle line:84%
and legal and everything else,
and it was one way I learned how

00:55:51.782 --> 00:55:53.184 align:middle line:90%
to live for free in America.

00:55:53.184 --> 00:55:57.421 align:middle line:84%
That's a very, you know, that's
a whole other conversation, but,

00:55:57.421 --> 00:55:59.924 align:middle line:84%
you know, my lifestyle
and my overhead had

00:55:59.924 --> 00:56:03.360 align:middle line:84%
to drop dramatically, and
I turned to my attorney...

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I realized
was the corruption was so bad,

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:08.632 align:middle line:84%
I turned to my attorney
and I said, "You know,

00:56:08.632 --> 00:56:13.037 align:middle line:84%
all my life I had supported
my self by doing, you know,

00:56:13.037 --> 00:56:14.338 align:middle line:90%
billion dollar deals."

00:56:14.338 --> 00:56:17.041 align:middle line:84%
I was somebody who was used
to operating 100 million,

00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:20.711 align:middle line:84%
200 million, a billion, and
everything was big institutions,

00:56:20.711 --> 00:56:22.646 align:middle line:84%
big governments, big
corporations, and I turned

00:56:22.646 --> 00:56:25.082 align:middle line:84%
to my attorney and I said,
"You know, we're going to have

00:56:25.082 --> 00:56:27.451 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to support
ourselves at retail

00:56:27.451 --> 00:56:31.622 align:middle line:84%
because if we want to do what's
in the interest of the citizen,

00:56:31.622 --> 00:56:33.357 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
to find a way to work

00:56:33.357 --> 00:56:35.092 align:middle line:90%
for the citizens literally."

00:56:35.092 --> 00:56:38.362 align:middle line:84%
So we... and in my world it
was considered impossible

00:56:38.362 --> 00:56:40.664 align:middle line:84%
that you could work at retail,
and my attorney turned to me.

00:56:40.664 --> 00:56:44.568 align:middle line:84%
She's a very serious person, and
she said, "Good luck, honey."

00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:46.003 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well,
wait a minute.

00:56:46.003 --> 00:56:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in America there is
someone making money telling

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.641 align:middle line:90%
people the truth.

00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:53.911 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a way to
turn this into a business."

00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:55.179 align:middle line:84%
And I looked and
looked and looked,

00:56:55.179 --> 00:56:56.914 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things
I discovered was some

00:56:56.914 --> 00:56:59.683 align:middle line:90%
of the grassroots preachers.

00:56:59.683 --> 00:57:00.918 align:middle line:84%
You would go to their
conferences,

00:57:00.918 --> 00:57:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're telling people
here's how you be a good

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:04.088 align:middle line:84%
husband, here's how
you be a good...

00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:06.590 align:middle line:84%
here's how you grow up, here's
how you work hard, discipline,

00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:10.794 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah, blah, and I
watched them and so I started

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:13.898 align:middle line:84%
to do radio shows and
suddenly people came

00:57:13.898 --> 00:57:17.868 align:middle line:84%
to me asking me what
do I do about this?

00:57:17.868 --> 00:57:19.203 align:middle line:90%
What do I do about that?

00:57:19.203 --> 00:57:20.337 align:middle line:90%
And one thing led to another,

00:57:20.337 --> 00:57:23.007 align:middle line:84%
and for several years
I said I'm going

00:57:23.007 --> 00:57:26.577 align:middle line:84%
to answer every question
I get, and if you look

00:57:26.577 --> 00:57:30.614 align:middle line:84%
at the businesses that I
now run, they simply evolved

00:57:30.614 --> 00:57:34.184 align:middle line:84%
out of that, of responding
to people who needed help,

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and then it was a matter of
turning those into skills

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.923 align:middle line:84%
and turning those into
a business, and everyone

00:57:38.923 --> 00:57:40.324 align:middle line:84%
of us is going to have
to go through that,

00:57:40.324 --> 00:57:41.692 align:middle line:90%
and everyone of us can.

00:57:41.692 --> 00:57:44.795 align:middle line:84%
We can, and everyone is going
to have to assess their life

00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:48.532 align:middle line:84%
and look at what their true
assets are in a brand new way,

00:57:48.532 --> 00:57:51.769 align:middle line:84%
which can also be good
relationships with friends

00:57:51.769 --> 00:57:53.771 align:middle line:84%
and family because you
might need each other.

00:57:53.771 --> 00:57:57.441 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the hard part.

00:57:57.441 --> 00:57:59.543 align:middle line:90%
There are two power centers.

00:57:59.543 --> 00:58:04.782 align:middle line:84%
One rules by force, and one
rules by love and intelligence,

00:58:04.782 --> 00:58:06.784 align:middle line:84%
light-whatever you
want to call it.

00:58:06.784 --> 00:58:08.819 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've all been
in the middle of the road,

00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:10.621 align:middle line:84%
and now we're going to
be forced to choose.

00:58:10.621 --> 00:58:13.290 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be on one side or
the other or you're road kill,

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:18.195 align:middle line:84%
and that's a separation that's
going on, and it's very painful,

00:58:18.195 --> 00:58:21.465 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, in the short
run it's always easy to want

00:58:21.465 --> 00:58:23.867 align:middle line:90%
to avoid it, but we can't.

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:26.937 align:middle line:84%
So that's the coming clean
process, being forced to choose.

00:58:26.937 --> 00:58:30.908 align:middle line:84%
Well, you are one wise woman,
[laughter] and you're hard

00:58:30.908 --> 00:58:33.243 align:middle line:84%
to get to, too, so
I am so grateful

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:34.445 align:middle line:90%
that you joined us here.

00:58:34.445 --> 00:58:36.747 align:middle line:84%
It's been my pleasure
getting to know you a bit

00:58:36.747 --> 00:58:38.115 align:middle line:84%
and also having these
two conversations.

00:58:38.115 --> 00:58:39.717 align:middle line:84%
Well you are doing
wonderful things.

00:58:39.717 --> 00:58:42.052 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
everything you're doing.

00:58:42.052 --> 00:58:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.889 align:middle line:84%
I hope this conversation
has helped put some reality

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:47.891 align:middle line:90%

00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:49.793 align:middle line:84%
