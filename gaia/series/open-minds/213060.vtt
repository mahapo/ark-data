>> REGINA MEREDITH: I'm guessing
if there was one wish most

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:10%
of you could have fulfilled,
it might be to have highly

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:10%
functioning psychic abilities.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:10%
In truth, it's
already inside of you

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.500 align:middle line:10%
but may need to be
coaxed out a bit.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Belief and conditioning
are the challenge.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Erika Gabriel is with
us today to speak

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:84%
about the elements of
psychic functioning

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
she's been practicing
since she was

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
a child and some of
the tougher subjects

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:90%
that we encounter in life.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.213 align:middle line:90%
So good to have you here, Erika.

00:00:40.213 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> ERIKA GABRIEL: Oh, it's
wonderful to be with you.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
you, your past as a child,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.390 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of a dark night
that you had to go through that

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
kicked things into action, which
often seems to be the case.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've been a medium
since I was a child.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:10%
And that was a confusing
time because it's basically

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:10%
something you can't put your
finger on when you're so young.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even
know what it is.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So when I was about seven years
old, I moved to a new house

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:90%
with my family.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And I started seeing a
little boy around the house.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And I got up the courage.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:10%
When you're young,
you're like you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:10%
get afraid to talk
to adults sometimes.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:10%
I worked up the courage
to tell my parents.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:10%
And I knew it was really weird.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.203 align:middle line:90%
And they did some digging.

00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And they found out
from a neighbor

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
that a little boy had
died on that property.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of how
it started, although I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
was an extremely
empathic child, I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.400 align:middle line:84%
sensed things about people from
a very early age and energy.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And having that knowingness
led me on a lifelong journey

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
to realize I was, in
fact, a spiritual medium

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:90%
and was connecting with spirit.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did your position in
your family and the way they saw

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
you over time come into a
position of trust where if you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
saw something, they
would actually,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:84%
even when you were young,
take you seriously?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: I think I didn't
practice my mediumship

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:90%
or my abilities for a long time.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.107 align:middle line:90%
But when I--

00:02:07.107 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If you saw something,
would you say something

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
to the grown-ups or just
keep it to yourself?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.193 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: I would.

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And it would usually be
about a person living

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that I would sense about
them or energy about them

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and let them know I'm
not comfortable with them

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
or why I was avoiding
a certain situation.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It was very much the
empathy component

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
as a child that was
really in high gear.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of the other stuff--

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.067 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was really,
really scared of ghosts.

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I thought.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my gosh, am
I just a haunted person?

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:84%
As a kid, you read spooky
stories and see spooky movies.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:90%
So I thought that as a child.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, I'm haunted.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything's haunted.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:90%
So when my parents knew that.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:90%
They knew that.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And I slept on their
floor till I was 12,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:90%
like in a sleeping bag.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, because I was terrified.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:90%
I was scared to be alone.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid of the
dark, which is common.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it's good that
they didn't try to talk you out

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
of it, tell you, you were
silly, and go sleep by yourself.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: That's right.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That was a gift.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Exactly.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And my mom, she got
remarried to my stepdad.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.437 align:middle line:90%
And he is so lovely.

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And I love this story, and
it always makes everyone cry.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But I was so scared,
and I laid in my bed.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, listen, this
is what we're going to do.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And he tied a string
around my finger.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And he ran it out of my
room, down the hallway,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
into their room, and he
tied it around his finger.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I got
scared, I would tug on it,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.498 align:middle line:90%
and he would come.

00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What a
loving, sweet soul.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Oh my gosh,
I love him so much.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that story fondly
because I had that support.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And it helps me
remember, gosh, I really

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:84%
was in such a way not
knowing what all this was.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it gave you
the opportunity to not feel

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
frightened and alone with the
experiences that we're going

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to develop into something much
more profound as you got older.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So mediumship-- and we're going
to talk about different kinds.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:84%
You talk about evidential
mediumship and what defines us.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to ask something I
wasn't planning on asking you.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:84%
One well-known medium,
certainly about 10 years ago,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:84%
used to say that
when we're talking,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to quote, "the
deceased," there's

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
always this argument of where
the soul goes versus where

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
the remnant of that
person's personality goes

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
and what that consists of.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it still a
remaining astral form?

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying it might
even be, as you the person

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that wants to have
the question answered,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
dwell on, think about,
and feel this person.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:84%
You're actually almost
conjuring those pieces

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to come back together to
create that astral body.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:84%
What is your perception
of all of that?

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking to?

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yeah, what's so
amazing is many things are true

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I am
working with spirit,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I see the soul come and slow
their energy down and reconnect

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:90%
with who they were.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so they
remanifest themselves in essence

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.947 align:middle line:84%
for you to be able to talk
through that personality?

00:05:05.947 --> 00:05:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Correct.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
that I'm reading

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.375 align:middle line:84%
for can be really frustrated
because they're like, wait,

00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:90%
he wouldn't have said that.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:90%
He was really an angry person.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul and
spirit is like, oh, right.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I have to remember that.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And go into those memories
as that incarnation

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and bring forward
those messages so

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:84%
that I can help my loved
one that's still living.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So they will have to
remember and come back down

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
to really regain that
level of consciousness.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Almost reconstitute
it because some of these souls

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:84%
have not only passed on but have
reincarnated even in some cases.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Well, I have
definitely read where someone

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.885 align:middle line:90%
feels very, very, very far away.

00:05:46.885 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And I also read for
people all the time

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, oh my gosh,
they're right there, very close.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But I can sense when
someone is deep, deep,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.465 align:middle line:90%
deep into the spiritual realm.

00:05:57.465 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Uh-huh, OK.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it just
feels a distance.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's a slightly
slower transmission maybe?

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yes, and a
higher level vibration.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Without the hallmarks
of the personality, so to speak.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.063 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Correct.

00:06:11.063 --> 00:06:12.352 align:middle line:90%
So I can sense them.

00:06:12.352 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I can sense what's
happening with their energy.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
But they have really unplugged
from who they were in some ways.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But the love remains, and
the connection remains.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so amazing
about talking to spirit.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.480 align:middle line:90%
It's like it is still there.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.478 align:middle line:90%
The connection remains.

00:06:28.478 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And also,
we have soul families.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So that has been before,
and it will be again.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So I would think the
love would continue,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:90%
the connection would continue.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing is getting
into the conversation about time

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and time being an illusion,
I do see loved ones

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.193 align:middle line:84%
wait for their loved
ones to cross over

00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:90%
so that they can greet them.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, in other levels
or dimensions,

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:90%
they may have reincarnated.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:90%
But you are met.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.810 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: By that aspect.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:56.908 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:06:56.908 --> 00:06:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And by your loved ones
when you cross over.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So some people are
like, oh my gosh,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:90%
are they going to wait for me?

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:90%
It's like, yeah, they are.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:90%
They're waiting.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.857 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's good to
know because we have to remember

00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:90%
we are multidimensional.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we pass, we are
still multidimensional.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: That's it, yes.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we can be doing
a couple of things or more

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
at once, and so not to try to
nail it down into one category.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think that's important.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So you do what's called
evidential mediumship.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what that means.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: So what's
interesting about that is when I

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
am connecting to
someone's loved one,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:84%
they bring through
really specific messages.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Again, sometimes they're
on different levels.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
But they will bring
through messages

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:84%
to serve that person
and messages that

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.587 align:middle line:90%
are relevant to them.

00:07:43.587 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So they understand, oh, yes,
that was their personality.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, yes, we did love
watching that movie together.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And they can make
that connection.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Even here on the Earth plane
where people are super spiritual

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're wanting to
connect, the mind sometimes

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
does not let us believe that
we're connecting, and that's OK.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to really want
to think about things

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and not just accept everything.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So with this evidence is you get
specific messages coming through

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.550 align:middle line:90%
from that person.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
In the mediumship
that I do as well

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.740 align:middle line:84%
is people's angels and
their incredible team

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, their
army, I call them,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
their spirit guides, their
angels, even animal spirits

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.405 align:middle line:84%
come through with
messages as well.

00:08:27.405 --> 00:08:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So you're not just going to talk
to someone who's crossed over.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:84%
There's so much information that
can come through in a reading.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you often
experience-- for example,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:84%
our household pets, our little
household companions are kitties

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and dogs and such
that come through?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Yes.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and it makes
people so happy.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'll see
a person's loved one

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:90%
with that pet.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So they'll show me
themselves holding

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:90%
a little white fluffy dog.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, your little
dog, your white fluffy dog,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.667 align:middle line:90%
I can see them behind you.

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You must have said
that because my white fluffy dog

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:90%
passed not that long ago.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And that must be why you
picked up white and fluffy.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And then do the little
animals sometimes

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.032 align:middle line:84%
have their own messages
for people as well?

00:09:09.032 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing-- and it
almost can seem hard to believe.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But animals are just such
sweet, loving, angelic souls.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So they bring through
so many messages

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:84%
just to help the person
that they were here for.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:90%
It's so much about--

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.743 align:middle line:90%
you are wonderful.

00:09:26.743 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love you.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.358 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yes, and
I really would say--

00:09:30.358 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and this brings people
so much healing,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and I really want to
get this message out--

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.748 align:middle line:84%
animals are not attached
to longevity like humans.

00:09:37.748 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: So people say, oh
my gosh, I had to put them down,

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:84%
or they were only
here for a few years.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like your
animal's cool, man.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, they're cool.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.612 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: They're cool.

00:09:46.612 --> 00:09:48.333 align:middle line:84%
They are not like
us that's wanting

00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:90%
to live as long as possible.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.708 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's good.

00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now what
about the other kind

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
of mediumship, which is
more predictive in nature?

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.590 align:middle line:84%
What's your
relationship to that?

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yeah, so again,
what's so cool about working

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
with the guides that I work with
is that if there is a psychic

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
message or predictive message
that would really serve

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.940 align:middle line:84%
the person I'm reading
through, it comes through.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So I never guarantee
that a psychic message

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
will come through in a
reading because I don't know.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm available to spirit in a
safe, very well-trained way.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if it's
going to be psychic reading.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
But at oftentimes,
there is because there

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:84%
are messages that would so
steer that person on their path

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and serve them in
such a way that they

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:90%
need to hear that message.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.735 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:10:37.735 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Did you have more
to say on that?

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: No, no, but
sometimes we do want--

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%
and thank you.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we so
desperately want like,

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:84%
just tell me how many months
till I meet that person.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:90%
And we want it.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But if our guides
tell us that, it

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:84%
takes away our
journey and our path.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And your guides, they're
not puppet masters.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.025 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying to control
you or take anything away.

00:10:58.025 --> 00:10:59.150 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to help you.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So those psychic messages
really come through

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:90%
if they're absolutely necessary.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And one thing I find
just fascinating about it other

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.070 align:middle line:90%
than--

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, granted, we are
multidimensional in nature.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So we have agreements
on a soul level

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that our conscious mind has no
idea about, number one, which

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:90%
is a problem.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a problem.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
We need to start catching up
and chatting with the soul

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
as closely as the
conscious mind, for sure.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
But if we're asking about things
that involve other human beings,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
really, what you're getting is
the culmination and direction

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
of energy in that moment
in terms of the agreements

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:90%
or complements between people.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's really just
stamped more in the moment

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.872 align:middle line:90%
of the energy's direction.

00:11:40.872 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are sliding glass
doors all over our lives.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.458 align:middle line:90%
And we're here for a reason.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:90%
We have a soul's purpose.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:90%
We have a reason for being here.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.615 align:middle line:90%
We have many reasons.

00:11:51.615 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
a huge course load

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:90%
when they come to Earth.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't just have one
thing they're here for.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we have certain things in
our path that truly are destiny.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:84%
We have certain things that
we are destined for that.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
That was absolutely meant to be.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of things are
choose your own adventure.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't choose to wear
this shirt today in spirit

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.840 align:middle line:90%
before I came here.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of choose
your own adventure.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and we're
going to get to that,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.333 align:middle line:84%
that whole free will part,
and what do you want to do.

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But following
through on that, I'm

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
going to use one
personal example,

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:90%
try to get through it quickly.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:90%
I had this idea many years ago.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:90%
It was the late '80s.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we need to
start having a television

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:84%
show on the news that talks
about alternative methods

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:90%
of healing.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:84%
We can't just go for
the same medical model.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So worked it out,
had a great agent.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:84%
That happened, signed a
contract, prominent company

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:90%
that serves the news stations.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Everything was lined up.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And boom, events
started happening.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Time bought that company.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
They said, hold on till we
get our bearings with Time.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Warner bought Time.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Hold on another six months or a
year till we get our bearings,

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:84%
till everyone says, oh, no,
we're dumping that division.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:84%
All agreements were made
between all the parties,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:90%
but stuff happens.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.990 align:middle line:84%
However, many years
later, in 2012,

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I end up doing the
exact same thing

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:84%
that I had intended to do on
Gaia under the name of "Healing

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Matrix."

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So it pops up what, years
later, from '89 to 2012.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And so if it's
really meant to be,

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:84%
even if it looks
disappointing in the moment,

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.805 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean it's somehow
not still working through you.

00:13:31.805 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: I mean, I
couldn't agree more.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.153 align:middle line:84%
And I will say, when you were
telling me that story, I'm like,

00:13:36.153 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:90%
rejection is protection.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Rejection is protection.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It just wasn't meant
to be at that time.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And I love that you
held on to that idea.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And I love the idea--
something I love to say

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
is if you go chasing
butterflies, they run from you.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you just create a garden
for them, they will come.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And you kept cultivating
that and that idea.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's so awesome
that that happened here

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.142 align:middle line:84%
in an even better place
and an even better way.

00:14:01.142 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: More appropriate
time when people were more open

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:90%
to that than back then.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I just want to
bring that up because sometimes

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
it's just timing, and
it's just players.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And players have choices.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So the other one is a lot
of people will say to you,

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know
what I'm here for.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand my purpose.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.455 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing my
guides used to say

00:14:20.455 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
when I'd hear them
talk to other people

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
is, well, what do
you want to do?

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.340 align:middle line:84%
What would you like to do
when they say, why am I here?

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
this whole notion

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.692 align:middle line:84%
of free will in terms of what
we're here to do because some

00:14:32.692 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:90%
of it's written in the stars.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.422 align:middle line:84%
But that's imprinted on the
soul who's made a choice.

00:14:36.422 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the huge questions

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:90%
that spirit asks people.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.610 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.695 align:middle line:90%
And they go, I don't know.

00:14:43.695 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they say, if you've got
everything you've ever wanted,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:90%
would you be ready?

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And they go, no, I'm
not ready at all.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's like why?

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Because there are blocks in
our path, really big blocks.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And part of our
journey here as humans

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is to find out what
those blocks are

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and work and love ourselves
enough to move them out

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
of the way so that
we can find our path.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We get plugged
into power sources

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:84%
that really have
influence and control

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:84%
our lives, like trauma response,
like victimhood, like fear.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can't get
through those blocks,

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and so we don't
know what we want.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And then if we find a way to
move through those, then we go,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm ready to come
up with my vision.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:90%
What do I want?

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we get into
imposter syndrome,

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and then we get
into guilt. And then

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
we get into all
these other blocks.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So really creating
a powerful practice

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
for yourself on how to quiet
the mind and go within,

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
that is the true
path and true journey

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:84%
to getting to your
soul's purpose.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Before you start
going, What do I want?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:90%
What would be amazing?

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:84%
it's like let's work on how
to quiet so you can listen

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.715 align:middle line:90%
to the magic of your soul.

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
going to find it.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to be the
person that's creating a garden,

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and all the butterflies
are going to come to you.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.087 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:56.087 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly said.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.483 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're
looking at free will.

00:15:59.483 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
choice, and we're

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
looking at choice from
different levels of our being.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So how often do you see it where
a person is-- doesn't matter.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
They're in relation to
something, relationship

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
to something, someone, some
entity, corporation, whatever.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:84%
But the larger decision
was made even before birth

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:90%
that this was to play out.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about it
before, but the conscious mind

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:90%
isn't aware of these decisions.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And how often do you see
that where there is free

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
will, but it's at a higher
level than ordinary free will

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.112 align:middle line:90%
and certain instances?

00:16:34.112 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Because before we came
here, we're in spirit.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at our life.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Why even come?

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Why come to Earth?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're here to learn.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:90%
We're evolving our soul.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:90%
We're elevating humanity.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
We're contributing to
God, the oneness, whole.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.620 align:middle line:90%
And so we do.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:84%
We have certain things in our
path that were meant to be.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I do not-- and my guides
also tell me over and over

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
again not every single
thing is meant to be.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, no.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: You know that
blanket statement like, well,

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:90%
if it's meant--

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And maybe two or
three key things in life.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And you still get to watch to
see how you interface with it

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.859 align:middle line:84%
and how you make decisions
around what the soul has already

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:90%
determined in those few things.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:90%
So there are things in our path.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And then many things are just
choose our own adventure.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Which way are we going?

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:90%
What path are we choosing?

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to--
at that point is really

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.060 align:middle line:84%
looking at and examining your
own faith and your own ability

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.510 align:middle line:84%
to surrender and your own
search for your own connection

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to God because God is
definitely not someone wandering

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:90%
outside of us.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:90%
God is within each of us.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And that spark, I
call it God spark.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:84%
That spark runs through
every single one of us.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And the more you can
connect with that spark,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:84%
the more you can plug in to
that higher connection to God

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:84%
to have faith and to
keep moving forward.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So when things do happen
that you're like, why?

00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Why is that there?

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:84%
When things do happen,
you go back in.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:90%
You go into God.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.180 align:middle line:84%
You go into spirit, whatever
you want to call it,

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.138 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to be God.

00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:90%
But you go back in.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And you get to that place of
faith and say, all is well.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
continue down my path.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you said
spark a moment ago,

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and that brought up in me an
important thing that has been

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
marginalized oftentimes in
Eastern traditions that have

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:90%
beautiful elements.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.240 align:middle line:90%
And that is the spark of desire.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- everything
exists due to desire.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Even from the original
spark of the creator's mind,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a
desire to see an effect

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:90%
or to create something.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So how much have human beings,
from your perspective looking

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:84%
at them, given over
their sovereignty

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and desire to this outside
societal conditioning?

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: I mean, yes.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes and yes.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:90%
That is so huge.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
We basically have
taken our power

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and plugged into
different power sources.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I love to use plugs,
where we plug in.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.410 align:middle line:84%
That visual just helps
me understand things.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:10%
We plug into outside authority.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.890 align:middle line:10%
We plug into--

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:10%
I love the news.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.063 align:middle line:90%
I have friends that do the news.

00:19:13.063 --> 00:19:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm very well
informed in the world.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:84%
But we sometimes plug into the
fear component only of news.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:90%
We're being totally controlled.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're just almost
walking through life

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:90%
with our eyes closed.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're not connecting
to anything that

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:90%
feels authentic or real to us.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That spark of desire
inside of us has been really

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:35.575 align:middle line:84%
almost covered in
a layer of dirt.

00:19:35.575 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Yes, yes.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The dirt of the noise
of society and conditioning

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and fear is covering this
beautiful spark of desire in us.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:90%
It's like we get numb.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you an
interesting story.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a very grounded
story, just for people

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:90%
to understand as well.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Last night, I was staying in a
hotel, and the power went out.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And the silence woke
me up, the silence.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:07.580 align:middle line:84%
That is how much electricity and
internet and electrical energy

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:84%
we have running
through our lives,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:84%
which that can even
scramble us and make us just

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.263 align:middle line:84%
completely detached
from ourselves.

00:20:15.263 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.972 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: And I
mean, I have a car.

00:20:17.972 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I love my cell phone.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.930 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not putting that down.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
We need these things
to stay connected.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
But to take those moments where
you just go out in nature,

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:84%
you listen to your
own magic, that

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
is what is going to help
people truly get to the place

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:84%
where they find their
purpose and really know

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.052 align:middle line:90%
that they're here for a reason.

00:20:36.052 --> 00:20:37.052 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're right.

00:20:37.052 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing
this a really long time,

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:84%
this thing I'm doing
now for a long time.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say the one
thing-- doesn't matter what

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
tradition, what the subject is
that comes up over and over--

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:84%
is if you really want to hear
yourself, go out to nature.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
She's the quiet place where
you can find yourself,

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that you have real
sustenance from,

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
whether it's under the
stars or from the trees

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:90%
or from the ocean.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:84%
It's supporting and speaking
to you and quieting you.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Yes, absolutely.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I do sometimes
is I walk around

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:90%
barefoot in the dirt.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And I can actually
feel the Earth

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
absorbing the electrical
energy in my body.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I think the other thing
that's really important

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and I want everyone
to really know

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
is that your intention is
everything in this world

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:90%
right now, your intentions.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So even if you're sitting in a
busy office with tons of Wi-Fi

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and lots going on, you can sit
in your chair for four minutes.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be a
three-hour meditation, for four

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
minutes and close your
eyes and just say,

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
my intention is to ground
back down into my body,

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:84%
to hear the magic of my
soul, to hear my breath,

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and for the universe
and for the Earth

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to support me and absorb any
unwanted negativity that's

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
running through my body or
through my energy space.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can just sit down
and listen to your breath

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:90%
to reground yourself.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Just taking that time, just
something small is huge.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.200 align:middle line:84%
When we hear these messages,
sometimes we think, oh my gosh,

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:90%
I have so much work to do.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I need to do meditation
for an hour every day.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I have to do all these things,
and it can seem daunting.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:90%
And so we just push it away.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
It seems like another
thing on our to-do list.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.608 align:middle line:84%
But I think just even
a few minutes a day--

00:22:21.608 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yes, you're
going to see a huge change.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So just start there
and watch what happens.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Perfect.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's get into one
of the thornier subjects

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
of being human, which
is when we can't

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
handle the challenge
anymore, when

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:90%
the noises become too great.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And we can't even
feel ourselves,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:90%
and we're ready to give up.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And right now, as we all
know-- and it's been coming up

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
in my interviews for
a couple of years now,

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and it's coming up in
your life every week--

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're now talking
about suicide.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Oftentimes it's young people.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Oftentimes it's young males.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the subject and how

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing it when
the grieving family comes

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:90%
to you in all its dimensions.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yeah, and this has
a huge part in my personal life

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:90%
and in my work life.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
My dearest and oldest
friend, the most gentle,

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.920 align:middle line:84%
speaking of butterflies, spirit,
she died by suicide a mile

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.550 align:middle line:84%
from my home, who was just
a happy, beautiful soul.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And in my work, I have
never, ever experienced--

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I've been reading for 16 years.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
In the past two
years, I have never

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:84%
experienced more people
coming to connect

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
with spirit because-- have
lost someone from suicide.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's an epidemic.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:90%
It's just everywhere.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, young
people, but I'm also

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:90%
seeing people older.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:90%
They're married.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:90%
They have kids.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:40.590 align:middle line:90%
They have friends.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:90%
They have a life.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.778 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could ever think,
and they're just gone.

00:23:45.778 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you're
not hearing that reported

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.020 align:middle line:90%
on as much.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: I talk to
a lot a lot of people.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.172 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So is there a theme?

00:23:52.172 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's take that genre or that
demographic of people that

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:90%
have a life, and they're older.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:90%
They've had their kids.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Is there any kind
of common theme

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that's coming through as to why
they're choosing to do this?

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: A lot of
times, first of all,

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I hear a lot of people
say, oh my gosh,

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.763 align:middle line:90%
I just made the biggest mistake.

00:24:12.763 --> 00:24:14.972 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what I've
heard from other mediums.

00:24:14.972 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: A lot.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I made a mistake.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
And also, I'm OK.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:90%
And I see it, and I get it.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I think what happens is
people get to a point,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and they feel that there is
literally nothing for them

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and no way out.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, people
that are older,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that have kids,
that have a home--

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They've done it all.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.753 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Correct.

00:24:34.753 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Or they just feel nothing,
and they don't feel anything.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
But I will say also,
although we are

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:84%
OK when we go into spirit,
my big, big message is stay.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Stay here.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Do not die by suicide.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Stay here.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:84%
There are miracles and shifts
and transitions and awakening.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I also see that so much in my
readings, people that wanted--

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
they were this close to
letting go, and they stayed.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And now they've written
a book about depression,

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:84%
or they've written
a book about this.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Or they've helped youth
that are troubled.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:90%
So your purpose is right there.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't give up.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and we can help
others that we know that may be

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.050 align:middle line:84%
going through, or we're sensing
there's a crisis and let them

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:90%
know this.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:84%
What about the kids, the young
ones that are doing this?

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Again, any common themes?

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yeah, what's
happening is kids are being

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
inundated with so
much information.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:90%
And they're confused.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:90%
They're completely scrambled.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
These young people, they're
scrambled, and they're hurting.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these souls are like
this brave soldier, lightworker,

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.042 align:middle line:84%
warrior souls that
come in, guns blazing.

00:25:50.042 --> 00:25:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to go,
and they get here.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, oh my
god, this is too much.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they look for
ways to feel better.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:90%
So they're looking for drugs.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:90%
They look to drugs.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.990 align:middle line:90%
They look to alcohol.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:90%
They look to internet addiction.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're just looking
for a way to feel better.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't make
them feel better,

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to stay here anymore.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So a lot of these
suicides are really accidental

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:10.840 align:middle line:90%
overdoses.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Correct.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.880 align:middle line:90%
And the interesting thing also--

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.700 align:middle line:84%
with accidental
overdoses, absolutely.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And also, people that-- and
this happens every week.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
My spouse, my
friend, my brother,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
my cousin went to a bachelor
party, went to a birthday party,

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.550 align:middle line:84%
wasn't into drugs, really
wasn't into drugs at all.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people were doing drugs
that, oh, you know what?

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it one time.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:40.645 align:middle line:84%
And they died instantly
because the drugs are not--

00:26:40.645 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Their
body's not used to it.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.728 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: They're
not used to it.

00:26:43.728 --> 00:26:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And also, what's in the
drugs, it's not like 1975.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah, not pure.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: No.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not condoning
doing any drugs.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:55.572 align:middle line:84%
And also, the drugs that are
out right now is really scary.

00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
They're filled with things
that just stop your heart.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're seeing
this quite a bit, recreational,

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.013 align:middle line:90%
just dying like that.

00:27:02.013 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Dying like that.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So just
complete accidents,

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that's not a part you
hear much about either.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.323 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Exactly.

00:27:08.323 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Total, total
accidental overdoses.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So I know we're talking
about dying by suicide.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And as we lead in
with drugs, it's

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:90%
like that is also happening.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And I want to mention
that because it's

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.597 align:middle line:84%
happening to so many people
all over our country.

00:27:24.597 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, thank
you for sharing that.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Another topic that is
particularly painful to people--

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if it's on the
increase or decrease or what--

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and that is the subject of SIDS,
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
This happened to a
friend of our family's

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:84%
recently, where a bouncing
healthy baby boy is healthy

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:90%
as can be at 5:30 AM.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And dad comes back at
7:00, and they're gone.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And this has a lot
of implications.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
moving parts with this.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Could you please share this?

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: There are
so many moving parts.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And for me, as a
medium, the first thing

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I will say to that is I have
never, ever given a reading

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and gone into spirit and seen
lost, scared crying babies.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to say that
because your soul that

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.400 align:middle line:84%
came to you, even for
a short time, is OK.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.117 align:middle line:84%
And then people say, but if
they're greeted by loved ones,

00:28:19.117 --> 00:28:20.450 align:middle line:90%
they didn't know our loved ones.

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:90%
They died before they came.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:90%
There is a soul recognition.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.255 align:middle line:84%
They are greeted, and
they are really OK.

00:28:27.255 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's a couple
components with it.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.930 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of components.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:90%
That's very layered.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Go ahead and share.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:90%
First, is that increased at all?

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Or is it-- in these times?

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Yes.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.413 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because I would think
that it's so crazy out there.

00:28:39.413 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:84%
A soul comes in
and, at three, says,

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to pull
back and maybe wait a while,

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.740 align:middle line:90%
jump back in.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.782 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Yes, exactly.

00:28:46.782 --> 00:28:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a
couple of layers.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So number one,
sometimes those souls

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
come in to fulfill a certain
contract with their parent

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:90%
that they came to.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:90%
So they come in.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a contract
that they fulfill.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:90%
And then they leave.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they also come in
because their parent is actually

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:90%
on their last life.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.370 align:middle line:90%
They're not coming back again.

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, explain
that one a bit.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: They are
experiencing-- basically,

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.480 align:middle line:84%
the most horrible thing that
can happen to a human is losing

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.710 align:middle line:90%
a child.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And it is the depths
of human suffering.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And there is nothing that spirit
can say to have that fully

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:90%
make sense to our minds.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
nothing that spirit can

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:90%
say to make it less painful.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:84%
They can give mental
solutions to help us

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:84%
when we're in the depths
of grief and despair,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:84%
somewhere for your mind to go
or some things to hold on to.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But there is nothing
that spirit can

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.810 align:middle line:90%
do that takes away suffering.

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's so, so
frustrating and challenging.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, well, that
would be one of those final

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.140 align:middle line:90%
lifetime lessons.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
So save the big one for last.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And also, my
understanding is there

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.065 align:middle line:84%
are times, which I was
saying in a lighthearted way

00:29:59.065 --> 00:30:01.440 align:middle line:84%
a bit ago, where a soul comes
in and says, you know what?

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.185 align:middle line:84%
The dynamic isn't
playing out in a way

00:30:03.185 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:84%
that I thought
would support what

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do in this
lifetime, what I came to do.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.810 align:middle line:90%
And the timing isn't right.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll leave
but sometimes even

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.420 align:middle line:84%
come back through the
same mother in that family

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
a little later on when the
situation has shifted a bit.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:90%
So many times they cross over.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the next child they
have, they come back to them.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Oh, absolutely, but
not all the time.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they stay
in spirit and are

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:33.090 align:middle line:84%
looking over the next
sibling that comes along.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.760 align:middle line:84%
The other amazing thing that
I've seen with these young souls

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:84%
is they come in sometimes
with one purpose--

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to experience pure
love and true love.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.060 align:middle line:90%
And what parents--

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which
you get as a baby.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.177 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: That's it.

00:30:44.177 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And their parents give them
that, and they go, thank you.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Peace.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Peace.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: I'm out of here.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.673 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Gotta go.

00:30:49.673 --> 00:30:50.862 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Yes, exactly.

00:30:50.862 --> 00:30:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
just so horrible.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Oh, it is the
depths of human suffering.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way to
really take that away.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
about soulmates?

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of very loaded
ideas about what soulmates mean.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And soul mate can be really any
configuration of relationship

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.050 align:middle line:90%
between any two people.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.440 align:middle line:84%
But we tend to confine it
to a love relationship,

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.410 align:middle line:84%
an intimate relationship, which
is where we're going to go off,

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to fly with
the butterflies together.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what you
see as true, deep soul mate

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:27.770 align:middle line:90%
agreements.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yeah, so what
surprises me when I work with

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
spirit on soul mates is we
don't just have to have one.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it can
be more than one, yeah.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: We can have many.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Your mom could be your soul
mate and your best friend.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.082 align:middle line:84%
And the person that you end up
with that you love desperately,

00:31:40.082 --> 00:31:42.290 align:middle line:84%
your partner or husband,
wife, boyfriend, girlfriend,

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:46.640 align:middle line:84%
whatever that you end up
with can be a teacher,

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.250 align:middle line:84%
is actually your teacher,
not your soul mate.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's all different
soulmates that come in.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.762 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a while, I
do see people that are together

00:31:54.762 --> 00:31:57.470 align:middle line:84%
or married or life partners, and
they are each other's soul mate.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.873 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very intense kind
of coming together as well.

00:32:00.873 --> 00:32:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And don't they
usually come together for really

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.370 align:middle line:90%
deep learning?

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Definitely, very
deep learning or very deep gift.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So they have a lot of other
things going on in their life

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.130 align:middle line:90%
or with their soul's purpose.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And they go, guess
what's going to be easy?

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.660 align:middle line:90%
My love relationships.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to-- yeah,
it's going to be butterflies.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:22.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like have you ever met
those people that are like,

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I met my person in
eighth grade, and we've

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.630 align:middle line:90%
been in love ever since?

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:90%
And we--

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I actually
have met people like that.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.258 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Me too, you know.

00:32:32.258 --> 00:32:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And they're my person forever.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And we love each other,
and we have a blast.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.242 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, really?

00:32:38.242 --> 00:32:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
how'd that happen?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Interesting.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:90%
But it does happen.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know
what everyone's path is

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.260 align:middle line:90%
or what everyone's purpose is.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I always
say, don't compare yourself

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.040 align:middle line:90%
to other people.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.390 align:middle line:90%
You don't know their journey.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.078 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know what your
soul has planned for you

00:32:57.078 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:90%
to learn in this lifetime.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe next time, you get
to marry your high school

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:90%
sweetheart.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Hey, there you go.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:02.645 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Next time.

00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:03.937 align:middle line:90%
This is not for right now.

00:33:03.937 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Correct.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because there are
rest lifetimes and hard work

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:90%
lifetimes.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.410 align:middle line:90%
And I think all souls vacillate.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're always
here to learn and refine.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.670 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we don't choose
as hard a path as others.

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Agree.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.880 align:middle line:90%
I have friends that--

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.900 align:middle line:90%
they're beautiful.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.390 align:middle line:90%
They walk on sunshine.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.590 align:middle line:90%
They're the happiest people.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.630 align:middle line:84%
They were born on
the sunshiniest day.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh my gosh,
this is their last one.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:90%
They've learned everything.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:29.700 align:middle line:84%
They have just a little
sprinkle of things.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or maybe it's just a
little rest because next time,

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:90%
there's some real work to do.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: I like that.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:37.488 align:middle line:84%
It's their rest, or maybe
it's their very first life.

00:33:37.488 --> 00:33:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
take it easy on me.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.272 align:middle line:90%
Make this one a fabulous one.

00:33:40.272 --> 00:33:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Show
how good it can be.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:42.772 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Yes, exactly.

00:33:42.772 --> 00:33:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So there's another--

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.290 align:middle line:84%
so now we get to the
topic of people starting

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.510 align:middle line:84%
to tap into their own
intuition, and they're starting

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.680 align:middle line:90%
to get messages from beings.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
discernment factor

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.300 align:middle line:84%
there because we
might not always

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.580 align:middle line:84%
be speaking to our
best guides and angels.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And maybe give us an
example or two and then

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.060 align:middle line:84%
how we can start
discerning between those.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: I love that
because in the work that I do,

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.580 align:middle line:84%
so many people
come to me saying,

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.920 align:middle line:90%
I had this amazing experience.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to help
people and be a medium.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.828 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, that
is amazing, and I

00:34:16.828 --> 00:34:18.120 align:middle line:90%
want to help people to do that.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.520 align:middle line:90%
And also, hold on a minute.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Don't go out and start giving
people messages right away.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.850 align:middle line:84%
You have to really
work and understand

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.159 align:middle line:84%
who you're talking to,
which is what you're asking.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Am I talking to my
guides, my angels,

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.510 align:middle line:90%
a loved one who crossed over?

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Or am I talking to that
level of stuck energy

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:90%
that we were talking about?

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is
you have to practice.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:44.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to practice, and you
have to work at it, really.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:47.540 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
arduous, or some people

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.340 align:middle line:90%
move very quickly.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Some people move slowly.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have a good
relationship with your spirit

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.110 align:middle line:84%
guides and you don't
know who you're

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.540 align:middle line:84%
going to be working with
when you're doing a reading

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:84%
or you're listening
to a message,

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I would say just focus on that.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Focus on your
relationship to who

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.330 align:middle line:84%
you're talking to
first before you

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:10.410 align:middle line:84%
go out and talk to anyone else
or take what they're saying.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So start working with
your spirit guides.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.460 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I literally teach
an intensive on how

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to do that because
it's so important.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's very important.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Yes.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's say you've
gone to someone who's a reader

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:90%
or has just started reading.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting
information that's

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.340 align:middle line:84%
really making you
feel uncomfortable,

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.650 align:middle line:84%
not just challenge
but uncomfortable.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is some fear.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.620 align:middle line:84%
It feels like fear flowing
through some of the messages.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:42.900 align:middle line:84%
How do you start discerning
who not to pay attention to?

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: The minute you
get that feeling, let it go.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:47.590 align:middle line:90%
No, thank you.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And just disconnect
from that information.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people that we
have thousands and thousands

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.807 align:middle line:90%
of thoughts every day.

00:35:54.807 --> 00:35:57.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to hang on to
each and every one of them,

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.840 align:middle line:84%
so meaning we have
that information

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
coming to us, which puts
a thought in our mind.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And we go, oh, this
feels really weird.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't like this.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, good.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Leave.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.395 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:36:07.395 --> 00:36:08.195 align:middle line:90%
Move on.

00:36:08.195 --> 00:36:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And let it go is such
a challenging thing.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:11.530 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.120 align:middle line:84%
When you're stuck on
something and someone goes,

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.950 align:middle line:84%
let it go, you're like,
oh, I didn't think of that.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.260 align:middle line:90%
It can be hard to do.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But release anything
that doesn't feel good

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't serve
you, especially when

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.070 align:middle line:90%
working in the spirit realm.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Trust yourself.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And then go back and
work on your relationship

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:28.090 align:middle line:90%
with your own guides.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, because
sometimes people will start

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:84%
invalidating themselves
and saying, well, I mean,

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:35.570 align:middle line:84%
maybe I do have some
work to do on that.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But that was really
kind of a harsh message.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to talk themselves

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.420 align:middle line:84%
into staying with that source,
even though it's not really

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.230 align:middle line:84%
feeling very good
in their belly.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Let it go.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Walk away.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Walk away.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.090 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.830 align:middle line:84%
If you hear a message
that you go, I like it,

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:56.270 align:middle line:84%
but I don't like it right now,
just put it in your file drawer

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and save it for later because
there may be something--

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.415 align:middle line:84%
if you trust the person,
there may be something in that

00:37:01.415 --> 00:37:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that your soul will align
with it in a couple of months

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:90%
or a couple of years.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:84%
There are spiritual truths
that my guides have told me--

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're
not ready for yet.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.823 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yeah, or they've
told me five years ago that

00:37:12.823 --> 00:37:14.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm still processing.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, get there faster.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Get there faster, Erika.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But you have to go in
divine timing and really,

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and what your soul is ready to
hear at the time and to take.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And sometimes you'll
run into situations even where

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
someone who claims to be
psychically attuned will say,

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:90%
oh, you owe me.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I died because of you
in my last incarnation.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:37.880 align:middle line:90%
You owe me.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And I know of these
things personally

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.850 align:middle line:90%
that have happened to people.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And especially in the
new age community,

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.520 align:middle line:84%
we're so open and
trusting, and so

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.120 align:middle line:84%
taking people that say
they're psychic at face value.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So there are some real
keys there to look out for.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: It makes me so,
so sad because there are truly

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.160 align:middle line:84%
people that their intention
is to serve and to serve God

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:90%
and spirit and to help.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But I always say,
in every field,

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:84%
there's people that don't have
good intentions, every field.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.523 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:38:08.523 --> 00:38:10.992 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yeah, and
I always tell people--

00:38:10.992 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:84%
people ask me like, oh,
should I get another reading?

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I don't know.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Ask your own intuition.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Ask your guides.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:18.918 align:middle line:84%
Never ask me if you
should get a reading.

00:38:18.918 --> 00:38:20.668 align:middle line:84%
People ask me, oh,
should I get a reading?

00:38:20.668 --> 00:38:21.690 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I never inspire people
to get readings.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.790 align:middle line:10%
I never tell people, oh, you
should get a reading ever, ever,

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:27.590 align:middle line:10%
ever.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.182 align:middle line:10%
That has to come from you.

00:38:29.182 --> 00:38:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you pick
someone that you really

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:32.168 align:middle line:90%
feel good about and good with.

00:38:32.168 --> 00:38:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's so sad that people
are hearing these messages.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And people in readings tell
me, I had someone tell me

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:40.370 align:middle line:84%
once I was going to
die in a car accident.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell me if that's true?

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.615 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, man, right?

00:38:44.615 --> 00:38:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Don't
go back to them.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: That's it.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you hear
it, say, no, thank you.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, no thank you.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: You are in control.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:52.940 align:middle line:84%
You're in control
of your energy.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.940 align:middle line:10%
You're in control of what
you want to listen to.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.030 align:middle line:10%
You're in control of
what you attach to.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So part of working
in spirit is really

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:84%
just trusting yourself and
having your own empowerment.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And for me, a huge part of what
I do every day is grounding.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.410 align:middle line:90%
I am not in spirit.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I am on the Earth.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:11.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the Earth plane.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.585 align:middle line:90%
I want to be here.

00:39:12.585 --> 00:39:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And really staying grounded,
staying in the Earth element

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:84%
so that I can raise my
energy, connect with spirit,

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and that people can trust
that they're safe with me

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.680 align:middle line:90%
because I am grounded here.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, very important.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the final of
those challenging aspects

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.780 align:middle line:84%
to this subject is the guru
complex, where people say,

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I am the way.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I have a unique access to
knowledge that not everyone has

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and falling under
the power of a guru.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Run.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Run away.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's mine.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Run away.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As soon as
someone says, I know the way,

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I have inside knowledge, run.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Run away because I
think there are amazing people

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.620 align:middle line:84%
that have amazing knowledge,
actually, that I love.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple people
that I just love.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And they have
amazing information.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But so do you, and so does every
single person on this planet.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.350 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So if someone says,
I am the only way,

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and these are the
only answers, that's

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.673 align:middle line:84%
what you want to run away from
because it's just not true.

00:40:08.673 --> 00:40:10.340 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
people on this planet,

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and there are so
many different ideas.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're so dynamic, and
we all have different paths.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.500 align:middle line:90%
There is simply not one way.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I have
a major issue with gurus.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to see
where you were on that one.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:90%
We're reflecting each other.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:26.170 align:middle line:90%
We both say, run.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:26.970 align:middle line:90%


00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Or skip with joy.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:29.393 align:middle line:90%
Skip away.

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we only have
a couple of minutes left.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So what's important for us
to really understand about

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:38.000 align:middle line:84%
ourselves right now when we're
going into a world that's

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.670 align:middle line:84%
transcending into
something more beautiful,

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:44.390 align:middle line:84%
but the process is tumultuous,
and there will likely

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:47.300 align:middle line:84%
be more polarization
between us as humans?

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.310 align:middle line:84%
What's the best
advice you can give

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.490 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what you see showing
up in the souls before you?

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Yeah, the best
advice I can give to everyone

00:40:55.670 --> 00:41:00.290 align:middle line:84%
right now is I use the idea
of standing on the edge

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
of an ocean.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.860 align:middle line:84%
You're standing on a
beach, and the waves

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.720 align:middle line:90%
are just coming big time.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.740 align:middle line:90%
The waves are coming.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're going,
stop, too many waves.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to say is the
waves are going to keep coming.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.030 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to stop coming.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But the best advice I can
give is grab a surfboard

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.460 align:middle line:90%
and ride them.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Stay on top of them.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:21.665 align:middle line:90%
And developing--

00:41:21.665 --> 00:41:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Flow with them.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: That's it, and
developing your surfboard.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.440 align:middle line:90%
What makes you feel stable?

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.390 align:middle line:90%
What makes you feel empowered?

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.790 align:middle line:84%
What can you do every
day for yourself

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that strengthens your
incredible connection

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.100 align:middle line:84%
to God spark or the divine,
whatever you want to call it,

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.630 align:middle line:90%
whatever resonates with you?

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Work on your
surfboard or a boat.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Build a boat.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.080 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that our
Earth is shifting and changing

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and the waves are coming,
don't be mad at the waves.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Get your surfboard, and
you're going to be OK.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Perfect.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.610 align:middle line:90%
We'll end on that note.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:10%
And next time we
have you on, we'll

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.570 align:middle line:10%
talk about things like
the perception of karma

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:58.620 align:middle line:10%
and all of that, OK?

00:41:58.620 --> 00:41:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIEL: Oh, yeah,
that's a good one.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank
you so much, Erika.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:02.657 align:middle line:90%
>> GABRIEL: Thank you.

00:42:02.657 --> 00:42:03.630 align:middle line:90%
It was a blessing.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Erika has a podcast
called "You Are Not Alone,"

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.210 align:middle line:84%
