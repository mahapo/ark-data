00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We've
talked about the effects

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:10%
of wireless frequencies
on the human body before.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:10%
But now, we can't ignore it.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:84%
A new $25 million study by
the US Department of health

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:90%
and Human Services is in.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And the science shows that
over exposure to EMF and RF

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
frequencies cause brain
and heart tumors in rats,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.880 align:middle line:90%
particularly male rats.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Jeremy Johnson is with
us today to tell us

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:84%
how we can begin
mitigating our exposure

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to these toxic frequencies,
plus a lot of other elements

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:84%
that come in behind
this story because you

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:84%
had a particular sensitivity
to these frequencies.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.447 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
ruining your life.

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So give us a little bit of
your back story for those who

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:90%
haven't seen you on Ted Talks.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.322 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:10%
>>JEROMY JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:10%
So I got into this
because of smart meters.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:10%
We had a bank of these
smart meters installed

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:10%
right below our bedroom
in San Francisco.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:10%
And before this happened, we
had none of these symptoms.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:10%
And then, after, we
started to experience

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:10%
headaches, heart palpitations,
ringing in the ears,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:10%
and insomnia.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was it was plain as day,
after the smart meters came

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:90%
in, all of this happened.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And so that got me
to look at this.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:90%
And I started to research it.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you go online, you'll
see that thousands of people

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:90%
had had the same thing happen.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And this also got me then
to look at the research.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:84%
In the last five
years, that's what

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing is
looking at the research,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and also finding ways to
reduce this type of pollution

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well let's
talk a little bit

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.930 align:middle line:84%
about your background
because you actually

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:84%
can interpret the data
because of your profession.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So I am
trained as an engineer.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And working in
Silicon Valley, I've

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:84%
always been interested
in technology.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that I've
always had an interest in.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And so I didn't
realize that this could

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:90%
have some type of effect on us.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:90%
I'd always used Wi-Fi.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I had always used cell
phones and computers.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I probably had 15 years
of pretty substantial exposure

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.145 align:middle line:84%
And then, that's when I started
to experience these effects.

00:02:45.145 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it really
took the smart meters

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:90%
to push you over the top.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.957 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your body was
handling, more or less,

00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:90%
some of these other frequencies.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:90%
But this leads to a question.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Is there a cumulative effect?

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just the effect
in the moment of exposure?

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Was it just that
the smart meters

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:84%
were so much more
intense in their output

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that your body and your
brain couldn't handle

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
that where it could
modulate, somehow,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
these other frequencies
from technological devices?

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
What we're finding is there's
something about smart meters

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that is putting
people over the top

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
into what's called
electrical sensitivity.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I call it being injured
by this technology.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.033 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And especially
when a smart meter

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:90%
is where someone sleeps.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's problems
with that because it starts

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:90%
to affect the circadian rhythm.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to have all of
these biological consequences.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Now smart meters are
different than some

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.480 align:middle line:84%
of these other technologies
because they're pulsing.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So they'll be
off for eight seconds.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Then, you'll have
a few short pulses.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that our
nervous system has probably

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
never experienced.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And so there is definitely
something with smart meters.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this
time and time again.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I've probably had
2,000 people contact me

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:90%
with very similar stories.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.196 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And it's
usually with smart meters.

00:04:05.196 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's with
the new WiFi router.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
For other people,
it's when a cell tower

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:90%
is installed near their home.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: But all
of these technologies

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.152 align:middle line:90%
are affecting our biology.

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
cell towers, what

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm noticing is
something kind of odd.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I live in Sedona
most of the time.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And the community is
very proactive in having

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:90%
those things removed.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it went to
the city council.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
proactive community.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So one of the city council
members' lives next door to me.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
And we had those things--

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.234 align:middle line:84%
you know, we rejected
them immediately.

00:04:37.234 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, they
had to fight over the fact

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.816 align:middle line:84%
if you're rejecting
a smart meter,

00:04:40.816 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
you have to pay a surcharge
to the electric company.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.692 align:middle line:84%
An extra $10 a month
to not have the meter.

00:04:46.692 --> 00:04:48.400 align:middle line:84%
They argue the point
it's because someone

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:84%
has to come around and
read your meter, right.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:90%
So you're paying for the labor.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:90%
But it's almost punitive.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The real reason they did that
is because they didn't want

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:90%
half the population to opt out.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Because people
know about this now.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
In California, probably over
100,000 people have opted out.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And they are paying those fees.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
In some states, you can't
opt out, which is really--

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's insidious.

00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:15.015 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:90%
In most states, that's the case.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go ahead.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you have something more
you're saying on that?

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.974 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Well I
was just going to say

00:05:21.974 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
that the utilities
know that people

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.730 align:middle line:90%
don't want this on their home.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHNSON: There's the health
aspects, the privacy aspects,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:10%
the security aspects, and
a lot these start on fire.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHNSON: And so they put out
a technology, which is not safe.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
They really just did it because
of the stimulus back in 2009.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:84%
They had to have something
they could put out.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was not the right
technology to put out.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.068 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: For people
that haven't already

00:05:48.068 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:10%
seen these segments before or
the documentary by your dear

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:10%
friend Josh del Sol-- you know,
your colleague Josh del Sol,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.090 align:middle line:10%
Take Back Your
Power, which I highly

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:10%
recommend-- let's go ahead
and go over, once again, what

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:10%
the nature of a smart meter is.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:90%
You just explained part of it.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:90%
It's pinging out.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But let's juxtapose it to the
old fashioned analog meters

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that are on the
side of the house.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So for decades,
we've had analog meters, which

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
are usually a glass enclosure
with a dial that moves around.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And the meter reader would
come out once a month

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and write down how much
electrical usage you had.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Or they would come by and just
look at the whole neighborhood.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But what the smart
meters are doing

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
is they are sending
that data wirelessly.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
But they're not just
sending the data.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
They're pinging
other smart meters.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
this mesh network.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And they do this, usually,
every eight seconds.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes less, sometimes more.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the trouble
with this system

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:84%
is that they're sending
much more microwave

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.260 align:middle line:90%
pulses than they need to.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:84%
On average, in California,
it's about 10,000 times a day.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Some smart meters pulse
190,000 times a day.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's unnecessary
because we really

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:84%
only need to send that
data maybe once a day.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it could be it
could be done in other ways,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But essentially,
what a smart meter

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
is is something that sends data
wirelessly back to the utility.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Also, some people that you've
known personally, for example,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
are so sensitive to
these frequencies.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
But not just that RF and MF in
general that they've actually,

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:84%
you said in your talk or
in one of your articles,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
have actually become
homeless because they

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:90%
can't be in dwellings anymore.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that a
little bit, and talk

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:84%
about the depth of the effects
that these technologies can

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:90%
have on ultra sensitive people.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Right.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the people
that contact me,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
there's things they
can do in their home

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:90%
to make it much better.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And most people can
still live in their home.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
people that simply

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.430 align:middle line:84%
have to move maybe
because they're sensitized

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:84%
to these smart
meter frequencies,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and the whole
neighborhood is filled

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:90%
with that, or the cell towers.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Or they live in
an apartment where

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:84%
there's Wi-Fi
routers all around,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and these people
do have to move.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, they end up
moving to multiple homes.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I know people who've
lived in dozens of homes

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
because it's hard to find a
place where they feel healthy.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, some
people do become homeless.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's this thing
where this type

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
of sensitivity, this injury,
isn't really recognized

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:90%
by society.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So these people end
up, often, isolated.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.577 align:middle line:84%
They often end up having
to live in nature.

00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is the perfect
antidote for all of this.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, a lot of
them do feel much better.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a few
communities off grid

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
where people live
that are better.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
I like to do my best

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
to help people live
in their communities.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's generally possible,
except for the most extreme.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really high density
housing, that's difficult.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't recommend
that for people anymore.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Even if people aren't
affected by this,

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
it's not that wise to sleep
next to five Wi-Fi routers.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely not.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And later in the
show, we're going

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:84%
to talk about all
the ways we can

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:90%
start cleaning up the problem.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, even
some technology we

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:84%
can use to filter out
some of these frequencies.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And also, maybe
just, at this point,

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
it would be good to add
in if you discover--

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.470 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you
ask people is do you

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
have a smart meter on your home
or in your apartment complex.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So number one, people need
to ask themselves that.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer is yes, I know
it's a state by state thing.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But just give a
quick recommendation

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:84%
of how they go about
having the meter removed.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Or a bank of meters
removed if it's

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:84%
an apartment building, which
is a little more difficult.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So in California, you can
simply call your utility,

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and you can opt-out, at
least in the big utilities.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And we worked to have this
happen back in 2010, 2011.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
But in other states,
the utilities

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.950 align:middle line:84%
generally don't treat
the customers very well.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Because
there's generally

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:84%
very few people who've
realized that this is what's

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
causing their
sleep difficulties,

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that this is what's
causing their headaches.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
ringing in the ears

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
is another thing
that people just

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:90%
attribute to getting older.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:84%
But if they look at it, it's
when the smart meters came on.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So what I would do
is definitely let

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
your utility know in writing
that you do not agree to having

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:90%
this technology on your home.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.789 align:middle line:84%
And start having
a legal process.

00:11:07.789 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
are various sites

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
you can go to that walk
you through that process.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:84%
In California, my building
was one of the first buildings

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:84%
to have smart meters
removed, and this

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
was before there was
an opt-out process.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I sent a
package to all the executives

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:84%
at PG&E. And I said,
here's medical records,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.720 align:middle line:84%
here's doctor's letters,
here's a legal affidavit

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
that says we do not allow
this in our building.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I sent this to
PG&E, within two hours

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:84%
of those executives
getting those packages,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the smart meters were
out of our building.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:90%
So people can do this.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And they just have
to, essentially, fight

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:54.264 align:middle line:84%
to have their own house be not
affected by these frequencies.

00:11:54.264 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well in
California, they

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:90%
are used to these complaints.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're pretty good about
coming out and swapping it out

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.457 align:middle line:90%
for a fee.

00:12:00.457 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Or you can hire an electrician
to swap it out for a fee,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, they
have to remove it,

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
then you have to have the
old analog put back in again.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I've done it a couple times too.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was fairly hassle
free, except for having to pay

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.810 align:middle line:90%
that surcharge every month.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Right.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:90%
But that's after we did--

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: After.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: --the work.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And if
you're in a state that

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.219 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have an opt-out, start
working with your neighbors

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:25.260 align:middle line:84%
in your community, and
raise awareness about this

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:31.470 align:middle line:84%
because you can get your utility
to have these choices if people

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:32.426 align:middle line:90%
work together.

00:12:32.426 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And this really is a
process of mass education.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, I mean,
I thought Josh

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:84%
did a beautiful job
in his documentary

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:90%
because it's very visceral.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.924 align:middle line:90%
You can look at the graphs.

00:12:43.924 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:90%
You can look at the science.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
You can get the
anecdotal experience

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.605 align:middle line:84%
of people who've really
suffered as a result of this.

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:90%
So again, it's available online.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:90%
People should watch that.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Take Back Your Power.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Also, we've been talking
about the ways in which we're

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
exposed where we have not
had a lot of perceived

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:90%
control over the situation.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:84%
But then, day in and day out,
we carry devices on our bodies.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And men, in
particular, will often

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
put a cell phone
in a shirt pocket

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:90%
or even in their back pocket.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And you said at you Ted Talks,
which freaked your audience

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:84%
out, there is
particular implication

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
if you have it less than
an inch close to your body.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Of course, if it's in a pocket.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Not about how the audience
reacted with a gasp.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
But what is
happening to the body

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
if you have it right on
your skin, basically.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:90%
So it was a few years ago.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.690 align:middle line:84%
The attorneys at companies
like Apple and Samsung,

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:84%
they started putting it
in the owner's manual.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:10%
And you can find this probably
on page 76 in really fine print

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:10%
in your iPhone owner's manual.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:10%
It says to not have
that, usually, it's

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:10%
half an inch, up to an
inch, from the body.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:10%
And that's so that they don't
exceed the FCC requirements

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:10%
for these exposures.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that's an
important thing.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:84%
When you have it in the breast
pocket, in the pants pocket,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
you're actually exceeding
FCC safety guidelines

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.610 align:middle line:90%
for these type of exposures.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the
thermal exposures.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.407 align:middle line:90%
And that's all the FCC looks at.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:90%
And now the science.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain the
difference between the thermal

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and the other
frequency exposures.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah,
so thermal, that's

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
what all of our safety
standards are based on

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:84%
is that as long as microwave
radiation doesn't heat you

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:84%
one degree Celsius,
then it can't hurt you.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And that was what
was thought in the 50s and 60s.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've just, kind
of, kept that all along.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But now there's
all this research.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Literally, thousands
of studies that

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
show that there's
biological effects

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
at the non-thermal
level at below what

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:90%
it takes to heat up our tissue.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And none of our
regulations look at this.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
one of the biggest

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
things here is that the
safety regulations are not

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:90%
protecting society.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No and Wi-Fi--

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get back to
the personal technology

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:90%
by way of smartphones.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But Wi-Fi alone, I mean,
it's so ubiquitous.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
You're in your neighbor's
Wi-Fi, your Wi-Fi.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I was driving down the
street, and a block away,

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:84%
the Wi-Fi system for a
Starbucks at a stoplight

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
was indicating that
I needed to log-in.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that
thing's way over there.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're being bathed in a
sea of these Wi-Fi frequencies.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, it's true.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's more
and more routers all the time.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.136 align:middle line:90%
And they're becoming stronger.

00:15:47.136 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that
was a powerful one.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, when you go
to a Starbucks that has Google

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.867 align:middle line:90%
Wi-Fi, that's very powerful.

00:15:53.867 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:90%
I was across the street from it.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yep.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And the new Comcast Xfinity
routers are powerful.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.575 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: A lot of the
AT&T U-verse routers.

00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:05.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: But the thing
to realize about Wi-Fi

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest exposures
are right near the router

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:90%
within 10, 20, 30 feet.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Once you get 50
feet from a router,

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.864 align:middle line:90%
the exposures are much less.

00:16:18.864 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
that's good to know.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.738 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah
because our devices

00:16:21.738 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:90%
need very little signal.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Very
little power density

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.485 align:middle line:84%
in order for the data
connection to work.

00:16:29.485 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So might it behoove us
if we like to work in a coffee

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:84%
shop- a lot of writers write
in coffee shops, right--

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.380 align:middle line:90%
ask where the router is?

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Exactly.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just make sure
your body is placed as far away

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.324 align:middle line:90%
as possible from it?

00:16:38.324 --> 00:16:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: That's what I do.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
that's really good.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard anybody
mention that before.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And for people who spend
all day in coffee shops,

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:90%
this is critical to know.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But also in your
own home, you don't

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.027 align:middle line:84%
want to have your
router near your desk

00:16:51.027 --> 00:16:52.360 align:middle line:90%
where you're spending your time.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, a lot of
people put their router right

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:90%
on their desk.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's, of course, the
worst place you can put that.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:84%
If you do have
Wi-Fi in your home,

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.720 align:middle line:84%
you want to put that as
far away as possible.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But then, run an ethernet
cable to your computer

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:84%
because your computer,
if it's using Wi-Fi,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.240 align:middle line:84%
it has its own antenna, which
is sending Wi-Fi, as well.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.665 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So it's
not just the router.

00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It's your devices.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
Back to ethernet.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, retro.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's talk about more
of the newer technologies

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that, it seems to
me, just conceptually

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:90%
have to be dangerous.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
that iWatch where

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
you have these devices
right on your pulse

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
gathering, and receiving,
and transmitting data.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about it?

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Has had there been any studies?

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: You know, I gave
a talk about a year ago.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:90%
And it was to a science class.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And the science teacher,
she had the iWatch.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.749 align:middle line:84%
And I measured it with
one of my devices.

00:17:58.749 --> 00:18:00.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're gonna
do that in just a sec.

00:18:00.748 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was surprised
how powerful they are

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:90%
because it's a mini Bluetooth.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's connecting,
so the iWatch

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.710 align:middle line:84%
is connecting to
the iPhone, which

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:90%
is generally in the pocket.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And people are
being bathed in that

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.202 align:middle line:90%
when they use these products.

00:18:18.202 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
iWatch, it's best

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:90%
to put it on airplane mode.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And only use the
microwave technology

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.390 align:middle line:90%
when you absolutely need it.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same with
Bluetooth headsets.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: You know,
Apple is really pushing

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:90%
everything towards wireless.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And I've measured
some of these before too.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And you have you have
an antenna in the ear.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have the
iPhone in the pocket.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not a good
idea, especially with what

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:84%
the science is now showing
us that this is not

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:90%
a safe technology.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's just take a
moment here to use your device.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And we'll need you to, as
you're demonstrating for set up,

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:84%
tell us what this
device is and what

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be picking up.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, we don't
have any technology,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:84%
except these little wireless
mics on us which this is

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:90%
picking up those frequencies.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
bring a smartphone over

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.234 align:middle line:90%
with everything on, OK.

00:19:16.234 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about this device
and what we're actually

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:90%
going to be hearing.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Right.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So this measures
microwave radiation

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
from 800 megahertz
to 2.5 gigahertz.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:90%
That picks up most Wi-Fi.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It picks up most of the
cellular frequencies.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of the
digital communication

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:90%
is picked up by this.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And this device will make
a sound, which will tell us

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:90%
what the source is.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:90%
It could be a cell tower.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:90%
It could be Wi-Fi.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Bluetooth makes its own sound.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:90%
So if I turn it on--

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.477 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:19:53.477 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now,
is that a fairly low

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:90%
sound that we're hearing here?

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: That high
pitch, we're actually

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:90%
picking up a local cell tower.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And this
isn't very high.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But this is more than I
would want to be sleeping in.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.040 align:middle line:84%
When I'm sleeping, I want
this to be very close to zero.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.899 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK now, yeah.

00:20:14.899 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say if
you can turn that off

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
for a second before we
measure something else.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Brings another question.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it my imagination, or are
we seeing an incredibly fast

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
increase, rapid increase, in the
placement of these cell towers?

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is because of what's
called the distributed antenna

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So they're starting
to install antennas

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:84%
on light poles and
electrical poles.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.676 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of--

00:20:41.676 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There we have
some imagery of that.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll get into
some of the other interesting

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.930 align:middle line:84%
partnerships that are
coming up in terms

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.400 align:middle line:90%
of placement of these things.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:90%
But even cell--

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I noticed driving through
the desert, two years ago,

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
you could drive down
through the desert

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and have a relatively
uninterrupted phone

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:90%
conversation with someone.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Now you can't.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.670 align:middle line:90%
It's dropping out all the time.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it drops out probably 20
places along the same road now.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:84%
What would be causing that kind
of interruption and service?

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm not
certain because, normally,

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.360 align:middle line:90%
with more cell towers--

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd think
there would be more.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, it could
be that there's more people

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:90%
using--

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that could be
something as simple as that?

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, we're
seeing an increase in coverage.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.707 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: But In
dense areas, that's

00:21:27.707 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:84%
why they're putting a
lot more of these cell

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:84%
towers up because people are
complaining that they're not

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
getting enough signal to
download things on YouTube.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's an actual,
probably, just drain

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
on the system from where
people are driving and chatting

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.730 align:middle line:90%
on their phones.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.102 align:middle line:84%
But another thing is
there are these very large

00:21:46.102 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:84%
electrical transmission
lines that you're

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
passing in and out of too
that seem to have some effect,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is another area
we haven't talked about,

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and that is if you're
living near power lines

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:90%
or transmission lines.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.870 align:middle line:90%
This is not good.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah,
the lower frequency

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.770 align:middle line:84%
electrical frequencies,
the magnetic fields,

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:84%
the electric fields, the
electromagnetic interference

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
on these lines is
just as damaging.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the science is
more clear on these lower

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.535 align:middle line:84%
frequencies that they
are very damaging.

00:22:14.535 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at
times, you see schools

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
placed under these transmission
lines, which is just shocking.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But now let's get
back to the device.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.102 align:middle line:84%
And let's bring a
cell phone into it.

00:22:25.102 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's move it around
the air a little bit

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.870 align:middle line:84%
because you can see our
little wireless mics

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:90%
are gonna tick it off a bit.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Now that da, da, da, da is
probably the wireless mic,

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
The mics have a lower frequency
than this should be picking up.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:90%
But it'll pick up some of it.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Now let's see if Hunter can
bring in the cell phone,

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:90%
hand us the cell phone.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:90%
And we have a cell phone here.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.070 align:middle line:84%
We won't read any
text, by the way.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.779 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So if you
open up a browser--

00:22:56.779 --> 00:22:57.579 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:57.579 --> 00:23:01.331 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to Gaia.com.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:09.077 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.077 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So that's
the microwave radiation

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
when it's connected to the
network or connecting to Wi-Fi.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah, interesting.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you're
reading it from here,

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
you'd see a considerable
increase in the output?

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:90%
So it pulses.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things it does.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Now when you have
the cellular data

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:84%
on, that phone is pulsing and
connecting to the network,

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:84%
usually, every
five to 10 seconds.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let
me do one more.

00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:37.438 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:23:37.438 --> 00:23:38.238 align:middle line:90%
Amazon.

00:23:38.238 --> 00:23:39.234 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:23:39.234 --> 00:23:40.034 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yep.

00:23:40.034 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And the more it has
to download, then

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
the more it's gonna use this
pulse microwave radiation.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
downloading a video

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
or watching
something on YouTube,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.727 align:middle line:90%
it's constantly doing that.

00:23:51.727 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.067 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about this.

00:23:54.067 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's turn that off.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.954 align:middle line:84%
And we'll give this back
over here away from us.

00:23:59.954 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.453 align:middle line:84%
So you're sitting
in your living room.

00:24:02.453 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You're using a wireless
to download your Netflix.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're sitting, what,
eight, 10 feet from the screen,

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.540 align:middle line:90%
in some cases.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.800 align:middle line:90%
What's that doing?

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Well
you're, essentially,

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.416 align:middle line:84%
getting the microwave
radiation from,

00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:90%
you're gonna have a router.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're gonna probably
have your smart television.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.613 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to be communicating.

00:24:20.613 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
be part of that field.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not a
good idea, especially

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:90%
with this technology.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:90%
We can easily wire it.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: You can just
send ethernet cables.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:90%
And it gets rid of all of that.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.004 align:middle line:84%
Now this is an area
that is really--

00:24:40.004 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into that
study in a little bit.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But there was another article
I read that just came out

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:90%
this morning.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It was another study
that said as much as--

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.410 align:middle line:84%
a significant one--
75% of all cell phones

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:84%
are exceeding the FCC
limits for this exposure.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Is that similar in the realm of
what you understand, as well?

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHNSON: Well
that's probably when

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:10%
people are using it improperly.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Then, they're
exceeding the exposure.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I think
some of these phones

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:84%
might not have the
testing that they

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:84%
need because does the
FCC have the ability

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:90%
to test every cell tower?

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.298 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: We know that
some of the cell towers

00:25:26.298 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
are not meeting the
safety requirements.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And so that could
be part of that.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And as we move into
5G, there's some talk

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:84%
about reducing the
restrictions on these devices.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So they might be actually
emitting more power.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, children in particular then,
are being very deeply impacted.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:57.536 align:middle line:84%
They're twice as vulnerable, as
I understand from any studies

00:25:57.536 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:84%
that I've done, twice
as vulnerable as adults

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to these frequencies, especially
their developing brains

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and holding a cell phone
next to their head.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.230 align:middle line:90%
This is really damaging.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah because
the skull is thinner.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.493 align:middle line:90%
There's more water in the brain.

00:26:10.493 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So more of this radiation
is absorbed further

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:90%
into the brain.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard stories
of kids in schools

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:90%
because now schools have Wi-Fi.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, kids are on the
iPads for six hours a day.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And kids get nosebleeds.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Headaches.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.500 align:middle line:90%
We know there's a rise in ADHD.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And the behavior of the kids
is being affected by this.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And normally, they don't
know why this is happening.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.562 align:middle line:84%
Some parents who are
paying attention to this--

00:26:42.562 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I know many parents
that won't send

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:84%
their kids to these
schools that have

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.850 align:middle line:90%
these very powerful systems.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you would
think that it would behoove

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.390 align:middle line:84%
the telephone
manufacturers to be, not

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:84%
only for a sense
of public trust,

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.950 align:middle line:84%
but to be proactive
in this way so

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:84%
that they can create devices
that maybe are more kid

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:90%
friendly.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they don't have the
capabilities or capacities

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.650 align:middle line:90%
of some of the adult devices.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But maybe the kids
can still get online

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and have a reasonable function
at much lower exposure.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.925 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard any kind
of talk about that?

00:27:15.925 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: You know, in China,
there's actually a company that

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.364 align:middle line:90%
makes a lower powered router.

00:27:20.364 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And they
did this, I believe,

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
it was like pregnancy mode so
that pregnant mothers wouldn't

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:90%
be exposed to as much radiation.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:84%
But in America,
what I've seen is

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.010 align:middle line:84%
they just don't want to talk
about this because they don't

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:84%
want the public to really start
questioning whether or not

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:84%
it's wise to have your
four-year-old playing

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:90%
with a microwave device.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they're not doing
anything on the safety side

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.100 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a shame.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's even
stranger than that, in a sense.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
you talk about is

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that, speaking of strange
bedfellows, children

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:90%
are particularly vulnerable.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet, to subsidize revenues,
both, schools and churches

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:84%
have begun allowing their roofs
to be used to put antennas on.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, it can bring in
$30,000 to $40,000 of revenue

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:84%
for a school or a church to
put a major cell tower up.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the school directors
or the pastor at a church,

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.720 align:middle line:84%
they look at that, and they
say this is free money.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:10%
In places like the Bay area,
I know the Catholic church

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.500 align:middle line:10%
in Berkeley and Oakland, they
have an agreement with AT&T

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:10%
to put cell towers in
some of their churches.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know one
church in Berkeley

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.050 align:middle line:84%
where the residents
around the church

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.604 align:middle line:84%
actually were able to stop this
from happening because they

00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:84%
banded together, and
they let the church

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
know that this is not something
we want in our neighborhood.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of churches,
they need the revenue.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So the cell phone
companies are very

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:90%
happy to give that to them.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well I
mean, you could say

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:84%
the one angle is that
the parishioners aren't

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:90%
there that often.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're in
a meeting or something

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:84%
in the communal hall a night
or two a week, at most,

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe sitting there
for an hour or two on a Sunday.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But in school, you're
talking about kids there

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.540 align:middle line:84%
for hours a day,
five days a week.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.070 align:middle line:90%
That should be outlawed.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in the future, it
will be because the public is

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.280 align:middle line:90%
waking up to this.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk
to people, they

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.480 align:middle line:84%
know they don't want to have a
cell tower next to their house.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
know that they're

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:84%
turning their
Wi-Fi off at night,

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.460 align:middle line:84%
or they're getting
rid of it completely.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.702 align:middle line:90%
And this is going to happen.

00:29:42.702 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.451 align:middle line:84%
And I just heard
that we have managed

00:29:45.451 --> 00:29:48.150 align:middle line:84%
to round up a smart watch
somewhere in the building.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:53.597 align:middle line:84%
So let's bring it over and
see what kind of sounds

00:29:53.597 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:90%
are happening from its emission.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.614 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:29:57.614 --> 00:30:00.550 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.547 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's weird.

00:30:01.547 --> 00:30:03.630 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't happening with
any of the other stuff.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Right.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's the Bluetooth
from the smart watch.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's going, pretty
much, all the time

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:90%
you have that on your body.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yikes.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It that because it's
searching for the phone?

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: It's
talking to the phone

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:20.020 align:middle line:84%
because it wants to get messages
that come through your phone.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ow.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:90%
[FREQUENCY SOUND]

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.138 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I don't
know who owns this.

00:30:24.138 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they want to think
about putting it on eBay.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.460 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't wear one
of those for anything.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it was
that bad, but my god.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's constant.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:90%
That's constant.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.147 align:middle line:84%
As many hours as you have
that phone on your body,

00:30:37.147 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:90%
you're getting that pulse.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
with Bluetooth headsets.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.154 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So that's the
[INAUDIBLE] in the eardrum.

00:30:44.154 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
thing is, people

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:46.967 align:middle line:90%
forget this is a body electric.

00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:48.675 align:middle line:84%
There have been books
written about this.

00:30:48.675 --> 00:30:49.974 align:middle line:90%
This is how healing happens.

00:30:49.974 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
It happens through the
electrical field of the body.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.090 align:middle line:84%
It's how our cells
communicate with one another.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:58.330 align:middle line:84%
This is, literally, disrupting
the cellular communications

00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Exactly.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the effect
on conception and fertility.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that we're in mass
in the developed world having

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.720 align:middle line:90%
conception issues.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And some people
will say, well, it

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the toxicity
of our food supplies, chemical

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.860 align:middle line:84%
fertilizers, and so
forth, water and so forth.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.250 align:middle line:84%
But let's put this
element in there.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Have any studies been done?

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.170 align:middle line:84%
We know that over this
relative period of time

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:84%
since the introduction
of these technologies

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:84%
we've seen more of a
decrease in fertility rates.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Right.

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:84%
The science is actually
becoming very clear on this.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Just this year, there
was a meta study

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that was released that
looked at 27 of the best

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.430 align:middle line:84%
studies regarding
fertility, especially sperm,

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:90%
in microwave radiation.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And of these 27
studies, 21 of them

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.880 align:middle line:84%
showed that it reduces
the quality of sperm.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
The biggest issue is that
it reduces sperm motility.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's just harder.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.571 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're not swimming.

00:32:03.571 --> 00:32:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But probably even a more
serious consequence,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:84%
some of the studies showed
that the microwave radiation

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
is causing DNA
damage in the sperm.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Uh huh, and
passing on corrupt DNA.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.610 align:middle line:84%
You could have a child that
is unhealthy because you put

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.470 align:middle line:90%
a cell phone in your pocket.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yikes.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So it's
pretty clear now.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Anybody
who wants to conceive,

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.320 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't be putting a
cell phone in the pocket.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's
fix number one.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.010 align:middle line:90%
That's an easy enough fix.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about studies.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned in the
opening of the show

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that there is a significant
study by the Health and Human

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Services Department.

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It was called, what, the
something toxicity program.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.280 align:middle line:90%
National Toxicity Program.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: NTP.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: NTP has come
out with a study that--

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.590 align:middle line:90%
well they haven't come out.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.310 align:middle line:84%
You have the data, but
they're not officially

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.250 align:middle line:84%
announcing the results
for a while still.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I assume it's for
damage control purposes.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.910 align:middle line:84%
That's just my
own thought on it.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.706 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
findings of the study.

00:33:06.706 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the biggest
studies ever to come out.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:90%
They spent $25 million.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.880 align:middle line:90%
They started this in 1999.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose was
to, essentially,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
prove that cell phone
radiation is safe.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But what it ended up
doing is it ended up

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:28.740 align:middle line:84%
showing a cancer in rats,
two types of cancers.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Gliomas and schwannoma cancers.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And particularly in
the male rats, but also

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.010 align:middle line:90%
some in the female rats.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of been a shock
to the scientific community.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah because
we've spent now 50,

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:84%
60 years with the myth that
cellular radiation can't really

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:90%
affect us unless it heats us up.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But what this study
did, it specifically

00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.840 align:middle line:84%
exposed these rats to radiation
that would not heat them up.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they still
got these cancers.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This disruption in
the cellular communication

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.695 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:34:08.695 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Well, yes.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing
that this study showed

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.680 align:middle line:90%
is that there's also DNA damage.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
Now there are a lot of
things that are-- first

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.219 align:middle line:84%
of all, tell us about how
this study was conducted,

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and over what period of time,
and what the exposures were,

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and how relevant those exposures
are to normal human exposures.

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So the study
looked at 2G radiation.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.370 align:middle line:84%
This is what has been
in our cell phones

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.980 align:middle line:90%
since, maybe, the year 2000.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.389 align:middle line:90%
A little bit before that.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty common.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:42.667 align:middle line:84%
It's not in the
phones as much anymore

00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:43.750 align:middle line:90%
because we've moved down--

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.699 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we're
up to 3G and 4G now.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: But this is basic.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.489 align:middle line:90%
It's GSM CDMA modulations.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And the frequencies are
between 900 megahertz up

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.159 align:middle line:90%
to about 1,800 megahertz.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
did is they looked

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:84%
at how this would affect the
rats over a period of two

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.600 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And they did three
different exposures.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And the SAR rating was
1.5 watts per kilogram,

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.220 align:middle line:84%
three watts per kilogram,
and six watts per kilogram.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And these are all exposures
that are below what

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:21.040 align:middle line:90%
it would take to heat the rats.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they cycle it
off and on for nine hours,

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:90%
I think, off, on.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Well they did 10
minutes on, 10 minutes off,

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.817 align:middle line:84%
for, I believe, 18
hours of the day.

00:35:29.817 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 18 hours, right.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, what they
found was there

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.450 align:middle line:84%
was a perfect dose
response relationship.

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So the
higher the exposure,

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:90%
the more of these cancer cells.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And that makes any researcher
look at this and say,

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:50.920 align:middle line:84%
well, you have something
serious going on here.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to change
this topic for society

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.530 align:middle line:84%
because the regulatory
agencies, the governments,

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have to
do something because now we

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.930 align:middle line:84%
have long term epidemiological
studies that show

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.180 align:middle line:90%
these exact type of cancers.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Now we have it in the rats.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So that means that they're
going to have to act.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be happening
in the next couple of years.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.670 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have to look
at this and warn the public.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:26.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's why the
researchers, essentially,

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.050 align:middle line:84%
released the data because
the researchers that

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:31.085 align:middle line:84%
were in this study,
they said, look,

00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:90%
we have to warn the public.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: We're not going to
officially release because they

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.375 align:middle line:90%
have to go through review.

00:36:37.375 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:84%
It has to go out
and be, essentially,

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.250 align:middle line:90%
reviewed by other scientists.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:90%
So that'll take another year.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted to get
the preliminary data out.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's a lot
in that that I would think

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.310 align:middle line:84%
would be very confounding
for the medical industry.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:01.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, why are males
more vulnerable than females?

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Is it a weakness of
some kind in the male?

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Or is there an extra
protective capability

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:90%
within the female against this?

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this could
have them going down

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:84%
the rabbit hole for years to
come, just that issue alone.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah,
that's possible.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.230 align:middle line:84%
My experience is
the medical industry

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:90%
isn't really looking at this.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.356 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to after
this report comes out, right?

00:37:25.356 --> 00:37:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, hopefully.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, the industry, and
media, and the government

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:31.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to try
and downplay this.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what we saw when the
preliminary data came out.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:84%
But at some level, there's
going to be regulators

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:84%
that are going to take the
safety of the population

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.200 align:middle line:90%
over the profits of companies.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen eventually.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.200 align:middle line:90%
And if it doesn't happen with--

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.210 align:middle line:90%
this is the biggest study ever.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the gold
standard of science.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And it proved that
something's going on here.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this was with 2G.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens if they were
doing the same study with 4G,

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.850 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:84%
What would you expect,
just from what you know,

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.150 align:middle line:90%
that same study to look like?

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Would it be any different?

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Well
it's probably going

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.140 align:middle line:90%
to be different in some way.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But these frequencies
aren't that different as far

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:90%
as the frequency.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.510 align:middle line:84%
What changes is the modulation
because the reason 4G can

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:26.590 align:middle line:84%
give you so much
faster download speeds

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.570 align:middle line:90%
is the modulation that's on it.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And the more modulation,
the more pulsing,

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:middle line:84%
probably the more
biological damage there

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.350 align:middle line:84%
is because this is something
that the body has never

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.420 align:middle line:90%
experienced before.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.630 align:middle line:90%
It's totally artificial.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:46.150 align:middle line:84%
All of this man-made technology
is brand new to the body.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we've evolved
in a pretty constant

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:54.880 align:middle line:84%
natural environment
for millions of years.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But this is not something
that our biology is

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.765 align:middle line:90%
it all meant to be exposed to.

00:39:01.765 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interfacing with.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:09.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, now the subject of
5G, which is impending.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about why people
are more concerned about 5G.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.860 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with
5G that should--

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and again, it's a ways off
still, a little ways off.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:19.276 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about 5G
for a bit before we

00:39:19.276 --> 00:39:20.566 align:middle line:90%
start going into the solutions.

00:39:20.566 --> 00:39:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So 5G, it stands for
Fifth Generation.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's the holy
grail for the wireless

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.790 align:middle line:84%
industry because it's
going to allow for,

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:84%
essentially, a
wireless civilization.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.110 align:middle line:84%
There will be autonomous cars
that will be connected to it.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.920 align:middle line:90%
There will be the smart cities.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.780 align:middle line:90%
The internet of things.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And it will then allow
for download speeds, which

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:84%
are so fast that
AT&T can provide you

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:53.950 align:middle line:84%
with HBO in your home wirelessly
from an antenna that's

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:57.610 align:middle line:84%
out on top of the light
pole in front of your home.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to download
a movie onto your iPhone

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:90%
within three seconds.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's how fast
it's going to be

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to have
a wide range of frequencies.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Gonna have some super
low frequencies,

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:84%
like 600 megahertz, 700
megahertz, which go a long ways

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and go through anything
so they can reach devices

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.010 align:middle line:84%
in your home for the
internet of things

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't reach with,
maybe, current technologies.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's also going to be
these very high frequencies.

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:32.700 align:middle line:84%
They're called millimeter
frequencies at 24 ,

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.990 align:middle line:84%
gigahertz 48 gigahertz, all
the way up to 70 gigahertz.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
really fast download

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:90%
speeds are going to come from.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:47.010 align:middle line:84%
But the true linchpin
for the 5G is

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to need to have

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:52.890 align:middle line:84%
cellular antennas on every light
pole, every electrical pole.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So essentially, there
is no escaping the frequencies

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.077 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:40:59.077 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Possibly.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.910 align:middle line:84%
But most likely,
this is only going

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:08.490 align:middle line:84%
to be profitable in major
cities, in very dense areas.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't see this
coming to rural areas,

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:16.590 align:middle line:84%
to even some suburban areas, for
quite some time because if you

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:84%
look at AT&T, they have 70,000
cell towers around the country.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:27.030 align:middle line:84%
In order to make 5G work, they
would need to have a million.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
take a lot of money.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.760 align:middle line:84%
That's going to take
tons of resources

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:90%
to put that infrastructure out.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.440 align:middle line:84%
That's going to take a
long time if they do it.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well you have the
learning curve that's going on.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.920 align:middle line:84%
As the education
continues to increase,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.410 align:middle line:84%
people are going to
start making demands

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:84%
that this not be in their
neighborhood, for example.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Right.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it
possible, in your opinion,

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:56.760 align:middle line:84%
that we could become
well-educated enough in cities

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that they simply aren't
even allowed to bring it in,

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and this whole effort might
be fruitless to begin with.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: It could be.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.700 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It could be that we've
reached a tipping point.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Because I
find that many people are

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.050 align:middle line:90%
educated about this.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.990 align:middle line:90%
And the science is catching up.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The science is now on the
side of the people who are

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.970 align:middle line:90%
trying to protect their health.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And with 5G, we don't
have a lot of good science

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:24.190 align:middle line:90%
on these super high frequencies.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But the science that
we do have finds

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that there's an impact
on our immune systems.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So we would, essentially, want
to have another NTP study where

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.630 align:middle line:84%
they look at how do
these frequencies affect

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.980 align:middle line:90%
the immune system of rats.

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.265 align:middle line:84%
And those effects would
show up in one to two years.

00:42:44.265 --> 00:42:47.670 align:middle line:90%


00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Then, you can,
essentially, relate that

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.290 align:middle line:90%
to how that would affect humans.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:53.542 align:middle line:84%
And we could say, look,
this isn't a good idea.

00:42:53.542 --> 00:42:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well this
is interesting.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.250 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a turn of events.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, the
science is actually

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.040 align:middle line:90%
paid for by the industry.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, a very heavy lobbying
presence for wireless, as well,

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:06.870 align:middle line:90%
on Capitol Hill.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of stacked against
the health of the citizens.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But you're seeing a turn
in this where, somehow,

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.210 align:middle line:84%
the researchers,
in spite of this,

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:19.810 align:middle line:84%
are able to share accurate
information with the public

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:20.610 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:21.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not as skewed?

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that what I'm understanding?

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Well I
wouldn't go that far.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.164 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the NTP
study is a big deal.

00:43:28.164 --> 00:43:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's a big deal.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: This is
not a popular place

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.790 align:middle line:84%
for people to
spend their career,

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:39.510 align:middle line:84%
especially if you are going
against this technology.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The hand that
feeds you, so to speak.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And we know that, of course,
this is a multi trillion

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.420 align:middle line:90%
dollar industry.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So the
science is not going

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:56.610 align:middle line:84%
to be as clear as we would want,
especially when the industry is

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:59.490 align:middle line:84%
funding the science because
it's very clear that when

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:02.290 align:middle line:84%
the funding comes
from industry, then

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:04.990 align:middle line:84%
they get the science that
proves their technology.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and
that's across the board.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what area of life

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:10.766 align:middle line:90%
the research is taking place in.

00:44:10.766 --> 00:44:11.640 align:middle line:90%
It's always the same.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.330 align:middle line:90%
You can count on it.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yep.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But we do have
independent science that

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.230 align:middle line:90%
comes from other countries.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Even some of our own
military studies from the 1960s

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and 70s shows that
this isn't good.

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: So we have that.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to take
the population requesting

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.270 align:middle line:90%
that the science be done.

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And not only that.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you see as an
engineer that there might be--

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.350 align:middle line:90%
well of course, there might be--

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.230 align:middle line:84%
a new type of
technology emerging

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't allow
for that same kind

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.600 align:middle line:84%
of boost in modulation
and those same frequencies

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.970 align:middle line:84%
being used that can
still allow us to have

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.520 align:middle line:90%
these access to our devices?

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Is there something new on
the horizon that you know of?

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: You know,
there's nothing

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.140 align:middle line:90%
that I know of right now.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.474 align:middle line:84%
There might be something with
quantum data transmission.

00:45:01.474 --> 00:45:03.015 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm wondering--

00:45:03.015 --> 00:45:05.060 align:middle line:84%
if quantum computing
is a reality, why not?

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, but that's
probably 10 to 20 years out.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The best thing to do would be
to truly study these frequencies

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:19.656 align:middle line:84%
and see if there are
frequency windows, power

00:45:19.656 --> 00:45:21.280 align:middle line:84%
windows, different
types of modulation,

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and different types of
polarization that is less

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.950 align:middle line:90%
effective in harming the body.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:27.889 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:27.889 --> 00:45:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And we just need to
have the real science on this.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.054 align:middle line:90%
But first we'd have to admit--

00:45:32.054 --> 00:45:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's a problem.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yes.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.229 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about how
we clean up the problem.

00:45:37.229 --> 00:45:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I know there are
certain technologies

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.330 align:middle line:90%
you can use to filter--

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:41.780 align:middle line:90%
some better than others--

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.030 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies in your house.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:46.630 align:middle line:84%
But let's do a little
A to Z quick guide

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:50.620 align:middle line:84%
on what someone can do because
the book that you have just

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
written is on how to choose
a healthy house in this way.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.280 align:middle line:84%
But not everybody
has the ability

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.614 align:middle line:90%
to go choose a new house.

00:45:58.614 --> 00:46:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's deal with
what we already have.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: In the book,
I also talk about how

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:90%
to find a healthy home.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But then, there's also
how to create your home.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:10.650 align:middle line:90%
How to use the meters.

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: All of that.

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's well done.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So the basic thing that most
need to do at the beginning

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:21.770 align:middle line:84%
is start to reduce their
wireless exposures.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily do that
by moving away from Wi-Fi.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Not having a wireless
baby monitor.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.610 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people
have TVs and things,

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:39.400 align:middle line:10%
like Apple TV or Echo, that
are using wireless technology.

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't encourage those.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Some of the wireless
speaker systems

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.430 align:middle line:84%
are not something that
I would put in my home

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.900 align:middle line:84%
anymore because you
can wire all of this.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And that's
the basic thing

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:57.280 align:middle line:84%
that most people can
do in their homes.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you also want to
get rid of cordless phones,

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and just have a
basic, wired phone.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.570 align:middle line:90%
And you can measure all this.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.470 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of fun to start
to reduce all of this.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, use an
RF meter, and see

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.640 align:middle line:84%
how things are being
reduced because you

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.830 align:middle line:84%
can get your home so that
there's, essentially,

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:19.450 align:middle line:84%
no wireless pollution once you
get rid of smart meters, Wi-Fi.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.610 align:middle line:90%
In some of the appliances now--

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.500 align:middle line:84%
we call them smart
appliances-- they're

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.510 align:middle line:84%
going to have an
antenna built into it.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they speak
with your smart meters.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:29.175 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:47:29.175 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Or they speak with
your Wi-Fi router.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or your
Wi-Fi router, yeah.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Or with your phone.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, so people who
are concerned about health,

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.750 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the most
important things

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:44.610 align:middle line:84%
you can do in your home is to
reduce the wireless technology.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can move on
to the other frequencies.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's also the lower
frequencies from electricity.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So you got the magnetic
and electric fields.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And most homes have one
or two wiring errors

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:00.820 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
electricians just

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.690 align:middle line:84%
accidentally connect neutrals
that shouldn't be connected.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's an
imbalance in the flow

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:07.570 align:middle line:90%
of current on the wires.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
you have a magnetic field

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that can go throughout
an entire room.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.375 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And it
would just take

00:48:14.375 --> 00:48:17.440 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes for the electrician
to actually fix. that.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know one couple
that, the wife,

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.030 align:middle line:84%
she wasn't sleeping
well for 10 years.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And I measured their home.

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.137 align:middle line:84%
And the only place they had
an elevated magnetic field

00:48:30.137 --> 00:48:31.720 align:middle line:84%
was right at the
headboard of the bed.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Because there was
a wiring error right there.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:40.150 align:middle line:84%
So we fixed that, and she's
been sleeping fine ever since.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So magnetic fields are
a very important thing.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I would say they're
probably more important

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:middle line:84%
than the wireless
frequencies for many people.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine
them that's when

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.650 align:middle line:84%
you start to get the
health effects if you

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:58.142 align:middle line:84%
have high magnetic fields, and
then high wireless technology.

00:48:58.142 --> 00:49:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So make sure you your
outlets are wired properly.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Mm hm.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's not an expensive
fix, for the most part, at all.

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: No.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and
let's talk about then

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.790 align:middle line:84%
your cell phones, Distances
of these things away from you

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:11.680 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Mm hm.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So with cell phones,
you want to, of course,

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.256 align:middle line:90%
never put it to the head.

00:49:17.256 --> 00:49:18.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
put it in the pocket,

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.690 align:middle line:90%
unless it's on airplane mode.

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:22.750 align:middle line:90%
So you want to use speakerphone.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.140 align:middle line:84%
You want to use an
air tube headset.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:30.940 align:middle line:84%
There's also ways to turn
off the antennas on a phone.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:34.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of phones have five
to six antennas in them.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you just go to
Settings, and you turn off

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:40.000 align:middle line:84%
the Wi-Fi, and the Bluetooth,
and the cellular data,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.720 align:middle line:84%
then that phone is not
pinging the network

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.740 align:middle line:90%
as often as it would otherwise.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And now it's acting like a
phone that we had 10 years ago.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And it'll only radiate when
you get a text message,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.607 align:middle line:90%
or when you send or make a call.

00:49:57.607 --> 00:49:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
another phenomena

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.106 align:middle line:84%
where we're driving in
our cars, and we put it

00:50:01.106 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
through the speaker
system on Bluetooth?

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.300 align:middle line:84%
What kind of effect
is that having

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.640 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to having the
Bluetooth set in your head,

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.440 align:middle line:90%
in your ears.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So most cars have a Bluetooth
router right in the dash.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I get in cars like
that, within 20, 30 minutes,

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I can become nauseous
and get a headache.

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Those are very powerful.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Bluetooth is not as safe
as it's marketed to be.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It does have biological effects.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend that when
people are in the cars

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to try not to use
this technology.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's very convenient.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:47.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's not safe because
people's minds are elsewhere.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ooh, yes.

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.046 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
you're still better off

00:50:51.046 --> 00:50:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to use the air tube headsets,
the old fashioned headsets,

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.420 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah because
that's probably--

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and you put the phone
over to the side.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:59.592 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:59.592 --> 00:51:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: When you're using
a phone inside of a car,

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.780 align:middle line:90%
you have the metal.

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's sometimes
reflecting those signals.

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And the phone has
to work much harder

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to reach a tower, which could
be five miles away, as you're

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:12.180 align:middle line:90%
driving.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
be exposed to more.

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
that's interesting.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have guessed that.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
informing because I often

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.329 align:middle line:90%
speak on Bluetooth in the car.

00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: What some
people do or who

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:23.970 align:middle line:84%
are sensitized to this
type of radiation,

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:26.160 align:middle line:84%
they actually get an
antenna that they'll

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:32.470 align:middle line:84%
put on the outside of their car
that is doing most of the work.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Well what about--

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is not for
everybody, but we did this.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I went through the home and
back to the old fashioned,

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:44.940 align:middle line:84%
plug-in the wall jacks
with my home phones.

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.960 align:middle line:84%
No wireless phones and
ethernets and so forth.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, went with Elon
Musk's technology, SolarCity.

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, turned
the house solar.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:52:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Converted it to solar,
grid tied solar.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Now there are problems
with that, which

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:05.220 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize until after.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that because you think

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.320 align:middle line:90%
you're doing a good thing.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a big proponent
of renewable energy.

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But solar, the way it's done
currently on people's homes,

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.340 align:middle line:84%
creates a lot of
electromagnetic interference.

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
created from the inverter.

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:26.884 align:middle line:84%
So you have solar
panels, which create DC.

00:52:26.884 --> 00:52:28.300 align:middle line:84%
They send it down
to the inverter,

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.160 align:middle line:90%
which turns that into AC.

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Well that AC electricity
going through the home

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.830 align:middle line:90%
is, essentially, polluted.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It has all these extra
frequencies in it.

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can use
a meter like this

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:43.460 align:middle line:84%
to start to look at some
of these frequencies.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.430 align:middle line:84%
This will look at
the magnetic fields.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is this called?

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.846 align:middle line:90%
And where can you find them?

00:52:47.846 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:90%
And how much do they cost?

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Just a little primer on how
people can get one of these.

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:56.340 align:middle line:90%
So this one is about $350.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And it comes from Germany.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:01.620 align:middle line:90%
I link to them on my website.

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.540 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty easy to find.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And this is a good one.

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It measures magnetic
fields and electric fields.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And some of the higher
frequency electric fields

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.820 align:middle line:84%
are what's coming
from the solar.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So you can measure
what's actually

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:20.064 align:middle line:90%
radiating out from your wiring.

00:53:20.064 --> 00:53:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's
devices that you

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:26.160 align:middle line:84%
can plug into your
outlets that will

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.470 align:middle line:84%
let you, essentially,
measure what

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic
interference is from the solar.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's go beyond this.

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:38.520 align:middle line:90%
We've turned everything off.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.480 align:middle line:90%
We've gone back.

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Our house is hardwired again.

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:43.490 align:middle line:84%
We're turning any Wi-Fi
we do have off at night.

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten rid of
the smart meters.

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some of
the technologies that

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.640 align:middle line:84%
are available to act as filters
for whatever we haven't mopped

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.680 align:middle line:90%
up by those practices.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, now there may
be some things that work well.

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:05.520 align:middle line:84%
In my journey in this topic,
I've probably tried two dozen.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes companies send
their products to me.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Other times, I just
have curiosity,

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.840 align:middle line:90%
and I try things out for myself.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:17.324 align:middle line:84%
What I found is that none of
these things have helped me.

00:54:17.324 --> 00:54:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.140 align:middle line:90%
You're sensitive.

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So you're like the canary
in the coal mine there.

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to other
people who have been

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.820 align:middle line:90%
injured by this technology.

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't make them so they
can magically use a cell phone

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.960 align:middle line:84%
or be in these frequencies
without starting to feel

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.950 align:middle line:90%
the effects after some time.

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.958 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Now I'm not saying
that some of this stuff

00:54:35.958 --> 00:54:37.950 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have some benefit.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But until people live in
a very clean environment,

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't think these things
are helping as much as they're

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:47.624 align:middle line:90%
marketed to help.

00:54:47.624 --> 00:54:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.915 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And so
once people are

00:54:49.915 --> 00:54:53.160 align:middle line:84%
living in a clean environment,
then they don't really need

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.170 align:middle line:90%
too many of these other things.

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's my theory thing.

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.540 align:middle line:90%
And what about your cell phone?

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.310 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
companies who put out

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:04.550 align:middle line:84%
various little
technologies that are

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:07.420 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be filtering the
effect of these frequencies.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.144 align:middle line:90%
Do any of those work?

00:55:09.144 --> 00:55:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: I don't think so.

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, I've
actually gone to festivals

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:14.630 align:middle line:90%
where they have them.

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'll pull out my
meter, and I'll show them.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.097 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, you know,
your phone is still

00:55:19.097 --> 00:55:20.180 align:middle line:90%
connecting to the network.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:22.054 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you're
making people cry, yeah.

00:55:22.054 --> 00:55:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah
because, you know,

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:28.050 align:middle line:84%
they'll say it neutralizes
the frequencies,

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:32.130 align:middle line:84%
it changes the frequencies,
but I don't believe it.

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So any final thoughts
on how we can protect ourselves

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and the mindset that's
required outside

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.830 align:middle line:84%
of putting a tiny home
out in the woods, which

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:45.500 align:middle line:90%
not everybody can do?

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: You know,
the thing that I

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:53.390 align:middle line:84%
feel is most
important for families

00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:57.380 align:middle line:84%
is that they realize that
there's something they can do.

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.910 align:middle line:84%
You can reduce the
wireless technology.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can either measure
these frequencies yourself,

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.620 align:middle line:84%
either by buying the meters
or renting the meters.

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Or you have someone come to
your home who has the meters.

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And you actually see
what's in your environment.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So educate yourself
as to what's really going on.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah because it's
all guesswork until that point.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're, kind of,
hoping things are OK.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Or we use a certain
product that we

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.320 align:middle line:90%
think is making things better.

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.070 align:middle line:10%
But when we actually
measure things, and then

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:32.860 align:middle line:10%
you can normally take a
few really simple actions

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:35.044 align:middle line:10%
to eliminate those problems.

00:56:35.044 --> 00:56:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, your home is
just much more healthy.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And it's a
pretty simple process

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.190 align:middle line:90%
when it comes down to it.

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:42.106 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:56:42.106 --> 00:56:45.390 align:middle line:84%
That's a simple, empowering,
and affordable message.

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate your coming
and explaining this to us.

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.424 align:middle line:84%
For any of the
information that's

00:56:50.424 --> 00:56:52.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of slipped through
the net in times past,

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:54.470 align:middle line:90%
like Bluetooth in the car.

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:55.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to know that.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Jeremy.

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And good luck with the
continued work you're doing.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.410 align:middle line:10%
To learn more about how
you can protect your family

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:07.810 align:middle line:10%
from these toxic frequencies,
you can go to EMFAnalysis.com.

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:11.330 align:middle line:10%
Jeremy also has a book on
this subject available,

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:12.980 align:middle line:10%
which you can find on the site.

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
