00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:20.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I'm so happy to have

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:10%
Theresa Cheung back with us.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.810 align:middle line:10%
She's flown in from England
to do this interview,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to start with
the end before we begin.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:84%
In her book, Dreaming
of your Future,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Theresa says that the
future you are looking for

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
is forever looking back
at you in your dreams.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:90%
A little twister.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Lots to unpack there.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe you just
got off the plane, got

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.425 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
sleep, and you're

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:90%
flying right out after this.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for taking
the time to come with us

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:90%
and do this.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.643 align:middle line:84%
>>THERESA CHEUNG:
Oh, it's such a joy.

00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely adore coming
here and seeing you, Regina.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we get to see each
other when I'm in England too.

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
that as we're out and about

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.310 align:middle line:84%
on the street, when we wonder
if this information is trying

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to take seed, you know
by the number of people

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
that would come up to you
on the street, for example.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And in your case, what's so
fascinating is in Britain,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:84%
mainstream media actually
features people like yourself.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
You're on mainstream
media quite a lot there.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I got a call
from a friend this morning

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
who said he was watching
you a couple of days ago.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:90%
So you're on all the time.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:90%
So what do you think's going on?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: I love it.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:10%
As I said, I've been writing
about this for decades.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.180 align:middle line:10%
And it's only been in the last
four or five years, I think,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:10%
that there's real
openness, and I think

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:10%
Gaia is playing a part in that.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
As I said, so many people
know you, Regina now.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
When I'm over there,
quite a few people

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:90%
do recognize me in the street.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.768 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: And watch it.

00:01:43.768 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:10%
And yes, just the day
before, I flew out

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:10%
to come for this interview,
I was on ITV this morning,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:10%
talking about afterlife
signs, the phone-in,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:10%
and I do many dream
phone-ins for them,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.330 align:middle line:10%
and also manifesting
phone-ins, all sorts of things.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:90%
On BBC Radio too.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:84%
There is genuine open
mindedness about this now.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that yet in the
US, not with mainstream media.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Really?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.389 align:middle line:84%
Because the perception in
the UK is the opposite.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
They think that,
oh, in America--

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.833 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Interesting
that you think--

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mainstream media
does not go there yet here.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Not yet?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they'll
actually-- if someone

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:84%
tries to bring that stuff
up, they'll generally,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
they'll chide them a bit,
and they'll be poking fun,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
uncomfortable to watch.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I am told before
I go on, keep it balanced.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.302 align:middle line:84%
Talk about belief, whatever, if
you've got scientific studies.

00:02:35.302 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm kind
of known for because I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
work with scientists
and neuroscientists

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:90%
and psychologists.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So I do try and bring
that in and say,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:90%
perhaps we don't know for sure.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:90%
I do always, when I'm doing--

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You modify it.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, the
people are watching you,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and you're invited
back because people

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:90%
like hearing the information.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:90%
So no.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Britain is more
open than the US.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Wow.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.707 align:middle line:84%
I will go back and
tell them that.

00:02:58.707 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please do.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:90%
With mainstream, absolutely.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, OK,
that crazy little thing

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:90%
that I read at the beginning.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I think that
was Edgar Cayce, actually.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm quoting from--

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From Edgar Cayce, yes.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get into
the notion of that

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and multiple timelines
and actual reverse time.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about everything
happening in this moment

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:90%
has already occurred.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.147 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The concept.

00:03:24.147 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Because this might be quite
a relief to some people.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about it.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, it's already
happened in a potential future

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that I may have had
a month or so ago.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Or certainly, I knew
I was coming to Gaia.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I would have visualized
and imagined this.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So I've been there, and my
future self's already here,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:84%
looking back on this
interview as well.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I firmly believe that
time is not linear.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
happening all at once,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and the reason we experience
it in a linear way

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
is because our brains can't
cope with it in any other way.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much
fascinating research

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:84%
out there right now showing how
the future can affect the past.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
The past can impact
the future, obviously.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the present,
it's all swirling

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.060 align:middle line:84%
around this infinite
possibility.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why dreams are
so powerful for getting

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:84%
a glimpse of the future
before it happens.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Because in the world
of dreams, as you know,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:90%
it's infinite possibility.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.040 align:middle line:90%
We've got rid of our ego.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:90%
We've got rid of our logic.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.590 align:middle line:90%
We've got rid of our reason.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:84%
We've got rid of our doubts
and fears often as well.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And in that state,
we can actually

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:90%
see the future playing out.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But that word potential, it
is always a potential future.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.423 align:middle line:84%
And that's where dreams
again are so powerful.

00:04:41.423 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
like the future, you see,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
if I had a dream
of this interview,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and it was a disaster,
there's a chance for a redo.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I can then in the
daydreaming state

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle line:84%
reimagine that and then
create a different future

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:90%
that I'm more likely to attract.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:84%
If I put my faith
and my passion in it,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that what
we feel about our future

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:90%
tends to be what we attract.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And also, here's
really interesting.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.875 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're aware of
this new branch of study, which

00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
shows that when the future
is viewed with feelings

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love, it's more
likely to be attracted that way.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Also, when you view your
future or yourself or others

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
with feelings of unconditional
love, consciousness expands.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Psychic abilities expand.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
That's a really, really
powerful message.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So if people listening
are getting anything out

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
of this interview at all, when
you think about your future,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
get rid of those pesky
doubts and fears.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Please, you have the power.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Think of it with
unconditional love

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
about yourself and
other people, and you're

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.475 align:middle line:90%
much more likely to attract it.

00:05:47.475 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
makes sense because it's

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:90%
such a fine high frequency.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:90%
There's no density to it.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.720 align:middle line:84%
You can move with it more
freely, I would think.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking of
the future, for example,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I think many, many
people watching

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:84%
this have precognitive
dreams, as you do and as I do.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a
dream, for example,

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.688 align:middle line:84%
that a spaceship is going
to blow up the next day

00:06:06.688 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:84%
or the stock market's
going to crash,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
those are some of
the dreams I've had.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, it
happens the next day.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm getting back
to that negative time.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Has it already happened?

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: And yes, it has.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It has already happened.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:90%
It's already occurred.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And you've kind of had a dress
rehearsal, a threat rehearsal,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:90%
often to know what to do.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
In a way, your dreaming
mind is preparing you

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.660 align:middle line:84%
for outcomes that
are not favorable,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:90%
to give you a heads up.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So that when you've
been there before,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:90%
you can deal with it better.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
You've faced the
worst case scenario,

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
power of dreaming.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Often, people write to me
and say, I'm so worried.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I dreamed a loved one died, or
this happened or that happened,

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:90%
or I was buried alive.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.965 align:middle line:90%
All these disaster scenarios.

00:06:48.965 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying
what it's doing is

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:84%
it's trying to help you,
give you a rehearsal,

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to rehearse
the worst case scenario.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
That's basic psychology
self-help, isn't it?

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
If you can deal with
the worst case scenario,

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:90%
you can deal with anything.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And you have dealt with it
before in the dream state.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So if, and it's still an if
because it's a potential future,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:84%
it happens in the waking state,
you've been there before, right?

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:90%
This is not a dry run.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:84%
You can make the
outcome more favorable.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that gets us
into the notion of free will

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:84%
into what creates
actual outcomes.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So here we have dreams
that many people

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:90%
will have at the same time.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're saying on one
hand, if you do not

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
look at time as something
and anything other than just

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
kind of an infinity loop
of sorts, this thing

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:90%
has already occurred.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
On another level, we might be
looking at potentials building

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
momentum, and it
hasn't reached its--

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't culminated
to its full point yet.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And we might be
tapping into the dream

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
when it's just a
mounting potential.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the power is ours,
collectively and personally,

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:90%
to change that momentum.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
If we don't like the
direction it's headed in.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:84%
There is tremendous power
in collective consciousness.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:84%
The more of us are
working with our dreams

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.553 align:middle line:84%
and altering these disaster
scenarios in the future,

00:08:15.553 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
there is plenty
of research to say

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.838 align:middle line:90%
that this can change outcomes.

00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I wish people would
look into the research.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.100 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:84%
We do have so much
power within us

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
to change what we
are attracting.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We are getting a clear
trailer for our future

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:90%
every night in our dreams.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have
the habit of waking up,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and people get into
their apps to see

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
if someone's texted overnight
or what the news has to say.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:90%
You're saying, bad idea.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
you start your day

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and what would be
ideal for humanity.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, I wish
everybody would start their day,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:84%
first of all, naturally, wake
up naturally without an alarm.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can train yourself to
do that because you are putting

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:84%
yourself right in the
driver's seat of your life

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:84%
from the very moment
you become conscious.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.888 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
an alarm is dictating

00:09:04.888 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:84%
what happens for
the rest of the day.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so funny because
I will set an alarm like when

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm here at Gaia, but I
always wake up 2 to 3 minutes

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.920 align:middle line:90%
before the alarm anyway.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I never set
an alarm otherwise.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Because your being
will tap into it.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.380 align:middle line:90%
It knows what time it is.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.170 align:middle line:84%
It knows when to start
nudging you awake.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's so harsh when
we wake up to an alarm.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, it's
equivalent to a mini stroke

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:28.630 align:middle line:90%
I've heard, physically.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And also, it puts
you at the mercy of your alarm

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and shows you that you are
not in control of your life.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Externals are.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And the
spiritual journey,

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
the personal spiritual
journey is all about inside

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:90%
out power, not outside in.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it shocks
you to the extent you

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.760 align:middle line:90%
can't remember your dreams too.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's like if you
wake up naturally,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
it's like putting a key
in the ignition of a car.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:90%
It starts everything.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:84%
To start everything
right, it's so powerful

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:90%
those early morning moments.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And then just keep still
and luxuriate in waking up

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:90%
to this amazing world.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
That we get an
opportunity, this Earth

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
school that we live
in, every morning,

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and send love to every
part of your body.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Really just send
healing, love, and light

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:90%
to every part of your body.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Do that for one or two minutes.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And then start asking your
inner world, your unconscious,

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:84%
your soul, your spirit,
whatever word you want to use,

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
what dreams?

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:90%
How do I feel?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Show me.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Give me some messages.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Give me some heads up.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to work on
for my personal growth?

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And almost always,
when you do that,

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
when you have that gentle start
for the day, just two or three

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:84%
minutes, memories will
bubble to the surface.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Try and keep still as well
because any movement will

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.515 align:middle line:90%
jettison those dreams.

00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy, does it?

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
If you're on your side and
roll to your back, gone.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Dreams gone.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, no.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:49.660 align:middle line:90%
I'll roll back.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Too late.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But if you
can't remember anything,

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:90%
just ask how you feel.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
let's talk about that.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Ask your body.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Ask your body.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
If you can't remember anything,
check in with your gut.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Your second brain,
that is your gut.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And your heart,
there's wisdom there.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And research on
precognition shows

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that that's the very first
place when we're awake.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, precognition
when we awake

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:84%
is much rarer because we've
got too much distraction.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But when we are
precognitive when awake,

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.265 align:middle line:84%
it's always the body
that knows before we do.

00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But in the
dream state, of course,

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:19.730 align:middle line:90%
the body's asleep.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:90%
We're pure intuition.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why most
precognitions happen.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I would say about 95
plus precognitions

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:84%
happen in the dream
state for that reason,

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.550 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't got
material distractions.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.832 align:middle line:84%
However, in the waking state,
we get that gut instinct.

00:11:34.832 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
we have that word.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:90%
It's in the body.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's going
to happen at night too.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't remember
any of your dreams,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
check in with your
body first thing.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said send healing
love to every part of your body.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:84%
See what your gut is
trying to tell you,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
what your heart's trying to
tell you about the day ahead.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.392 align:middle line:84%
And then write in your
journal how you feel.

00:11:53.392 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to take long.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:84%
We've all got busy
lives, and I know,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.132 align:middle line:84%
Regina, you're always
rushing all over the place,

00:11:58.132 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure a lot of
people listening are too.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:84%
We haven't got
time in the morning

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:84%
to do all this
meditating, these two-hour

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:84%
meditations that people
sometimes recommend.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Who's got time for that?

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just a few minutes course
correcting in the morning

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and doing something slightly
different from alarm goes off.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Get out of bed.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Check my phone.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Please don't do that.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:84%
You do yourself a
great disservice.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And you will notice your
life change radically

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
if you change that, and it will
change in a couple of weeks.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:90%
You will feel better.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:90%
You will feel more in charge.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.125 align:middle line:84%
And keep that I'm in charge
of my day feeling going

00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:90%
for the first half an hour.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
When you get dressed,
when you shower,

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.687 align:middle line:84%
when you have your
breakfast or whatever

00:12:38.687 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
your morning routine is, just
think about how you feel.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily what you've
got to do with the day ahead,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.053 align:middle line:84%
but how you feel, what
dream memories come.

00:12:47.053 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let me ask
you a question about that

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
because that's one thing I've
always understood about dreams

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:84%
is we may each dream
about the same scenario,

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's about the way you feel
within the dream that matters.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're all
seeing the same thing,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
it means something
different to each of us.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible, for example,
as you say, when you come back

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and you are remembering
feeling, how

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:84%
you felt, you're
maintaining that feeling,

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that you might be able to
use that feeling to remember

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:90%
your way back to the dream?

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Absolutely.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.520 align:middle line:90%
That will trigger some memory.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And it could be just a word,
or a symbol, or a person.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:84%
As soon as that comes to
mind, please write it down.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you can brainstorm
symbolic associations

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:90%
around that.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.567 align:middle line:84%
And why are feeling
so important.

00:13:36.567 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course, they are.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.412 align:middle line:84%
Because how you
feel unconsciously,

00:13:40.412 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
which is in the
dream state, you're

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:84%
seeing your
unconscious feeling, is

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:84%
what you tend to attract
in your waking life.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Because in our waking life, we
often tell ourselves stories.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.547 align:middle line:84%
We convince ourselves
that this doesn't matter.

00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't matter.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:90%
We deny, repress.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
That's just what happens
when we're awake.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have to because
we have to be practical.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:84%
We're in this world
for practical reasons.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get
on with our life.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But in the dream
state, we get a chance

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to see how we really feel
about the state of our soul,

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.690 align:middle line:84%
not the state of our nation,
the state of our soul.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most important
thing because dreams don't lie.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:84%
How you feel about
yourself in the inside out

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:84%
is what you tend to attract
in your waking life.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:90%
It matters.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk, because we're

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:84%
talking about a little
bit of precognition.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:84%
There's something called
precognition boosting.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
practice of some sort.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I wish we had
this stack of them out here.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I cannot believe how many books
you've written in the last year.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever sleep?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I know you're passionate
about what you do.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: I do.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
just so much gold

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:90%
in each of these books.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.377 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into the notion
of precognitive boosting.

00:14:49.377 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Precognitive boosting.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing you can
do is to write down your dreams.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the majority
of precognitions

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:84%
will happen in the
dream state because you

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:84%
are pure intuition, precognition
for want of a better word.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I actually think
intuition, sixth sense,

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:84%
all this is actually
precognition, just

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
a different name
for the same thing.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:84%
They have subtle differences,
clairvoyance, et cetera.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:90%
So write down your dreams.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:90%
The second thing is hindsight.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Please go back to your dreams
from three or four days prior,

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
because that tends to be when
déjà rêvé, a dream remember,

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.190 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
It's usually two or
three days that it

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
takes to manifest
in your waking life.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.777 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've noticed that.

00:15:26.777 --> 00:15:28.443 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: So go
back in hindsight.

00:15:28.443 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon
as you get a hit,

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and you will get a
precognitive hit, whether it

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol, a person
you are in touch with,

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.420 align:middle line:84%
a conversation, or an emotion
and a mindset, ring it in red

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.122 align:middle line:84%
and say, this is my proof
that I'm a precognitive being.

00:15:43.122 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got to prove to
yourself first because we've

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:84%
been so conditioned to
believe that we are not.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
We've been
conditioned to believe

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:90%
that we are rational beings.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not logical, but you need
to prove to yourself that you

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:90%
are a precognitive being.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And just to go on a
bit of a tangent here,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.315 align:middle line:90%
I do tend to do that.

00:16:00.315 --> 00:16:01.148 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please do.

00:16:01.148 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:90%
I like your tangent.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.258 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEUNG: You're actually
going with the natural flow

00:16:04.258 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:10%
of your brain when
you're precognitive.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are hard
wired to be precognitive.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:84%
The mysterious
butterflies of the brains

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:84%
seek patterns, seek
out the future.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
shame that we've been

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
told that the natural
flow of our brains

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:90%
is where we shouldn't go.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.190 align:middle line:84%
We've been told to fight
that and repress it.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Study after study shows now
that our brains are natural time

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:90%
traveling machines.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.722 align:middle line:84%
So actually, when you're working
with your dreams precognitive,

00:16:32.722 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:84%
you're doing what
your brain loves.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Your brain will
thank you for it.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:90%
It's the relief they get.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:90%
It gets me.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:90%
We're going with the flow now.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So prove to yourself,
first of all.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:84%
You need that first precognitive
hit, that's what I call it.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And then more and more
will filter through.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Also, when you have a dream,
whatever you dream about,

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.490 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter whether
it's a color, a situation,

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
a person try within
reason and safely

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
to meet an aspect of that
dream in your waking life.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, if you
saw roses in your dream,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.380 align:middle line:84%
buy yourself a bunch of roses
and just have a sacred moment

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:84%
when you reconnect that your
dreaming mind and your waking

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:84%
mind are having this moment
of connection and recognition

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.980 align:middle line:90%
that they are one.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And like you say,
and symbols and colors as well.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Absolutely.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Anything like that.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Just to show, basically
during the day, dreaming mind,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:90%
I noticed.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're
talking to me,

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:90%
and I'm taking you seriously.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what the
dreaming mind wants.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
It craves your attention
and to be taken seriously.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
It has got very
depressed over the years,

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
being dismissed, ridiculed,
just a dream, which

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I say time and time again, I'm
on a mission to obliterate.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.485 align:middle line:90%
That it is not--

00:17:41.485 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please do.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And especially when parents say
to their kids, oh, no, honey,

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.875 align:middle line:90%
it was just a dream.

00:17:45.875 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: So much
damage is done.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By the time we're
three and can talk and share

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.082 align:middle line:90%
these things, it's done.

00:17:51.082 --> 00:17:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Tell Einstein that.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Imagination is more
important than knowledge.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So much of his world
changing theories

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:90%
came from the dream state.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if you do
look in the creative minds,

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
dreaming is at the fore.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
It gives them that
brainstorming insight.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.957 align:middle line:84%
Einstein, Schweitzer,
and a lot of them,

00:18:09.957 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:84%
they dreamed a lot of
their formulations--

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Because you
can't, in the waking state.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.842 align:middle line:84%
Regina, you can't
in the waking state

00:18:14.842 --> 00:18:16.567 align:middle line:84%
make connections
between two things,

00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that in the waking
state, you'd think, well,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:90%
that's preposterous.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.420 align:middle line:84%
However, in the dream state,
nothing is out of bounds.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.582 align:middle line:84%
You can make connections in
different areas of your life,

00:18:25.582 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
in different walks of
life that you would never

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.640 align:middle line:84%
dream, to forgive the pun,
of doing when you're awake.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
That's why dreams are so
powerful, because the only thing

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:90%
missing is logic and reason.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, you
can quite literally fly.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why world-changing
theories, inventions,

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.845 align:middle line:84%
discoveries have happened
in the dream state.

00:18:45.845 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
the world of artists too.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Artists, yes.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.327 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's get
into something that is,

00:18:52.327 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
for some people, very,
very uncomfortable.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.943 align:middle line:84%
You're doing some
incredible things with it.

00:18:55.943 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:90%
The subject of nightmares.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you look at
nightmares quite differently.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what led me
to jump right into that.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:90%
You think of color.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you have a dream that's
soaked in a blackish red blood,

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to go out
and get that and invest it

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:90%
into your daily life.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:90%
That's a little different.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It's different than
a pretty rose--

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Within
reason when I say--

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Within reason.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about nightmares.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:90%
I have many questions.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
One of them is is there a
greater occurrence of nightmares

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
occurring at this point
in time that you're

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
aware of because the world
seems to be in a much more

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
dangerous position than it
was even a year or two ago.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I do a phone-in
the UK, a national phone-in,

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I know that the next day or even
the same day, my message box

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:84%
will be flooded with people
wanting understanding

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:90%
of their dreams.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And 98, 99% of those dreams
are anxiety nightmare ones.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't had that before.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:84%
When I used to do the odd
bit of media in the past,

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
they were more happier dreams
about dancing, singing, flying.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.210 align:middle line:84%
But it does tend to be a
lot of anxiety at the moment

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.070 align:middle line:84%
because the world is
in a really, really

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:90%
complicated state.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:84%
But I always try and
reassure every single person

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:84%
who writes to me or asks me
about nightmares that this

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
is a sign of awakening
because we are going deep

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
into your shadow side what
is repressed and denied.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:84%
You need to go through this
darkness before the awakening,

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.920 align:middle line:90%
before the dawn.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Just go through it
with love for yourself

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and understanding for
yourself because there

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.200 align:middle line:84%
are aspects of yourself
that you are not addressing

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and you really, really need to
for your personal and spiritual

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:90%
growth.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And I always reassure them
that almost all dreams

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:84%
are symbolic in reenactments
of your mindset.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:90%
They are not literal.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
But then again, dreams
don't like to be confined.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:84%
You do get the odd occurrence
when dreams are literal.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
They're stunningly precognitive.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
there's nothing

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
you could have done
to change that future.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.198 align:middle line:90%
It was meant to be.

00:20:59.198 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
People often feel
guilty when they've

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.870 align:middle line:84%
had a precognitive dream,
and it does play out,

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's negative for
themselves or others.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.347 align:middle line:84%
And they think, could
I have avoided it?

00:21:06.347 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can speak to the
person involved or yourself

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:90%
and maybe try and make changes.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:84%
But if it's meant to
be, it will happen.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we take this notion
of these challenging times.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:90%
We take the notion of chaos.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And that it creates a stressor
on the being psychospiritually.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:90%
A stressor.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So it is going to help
us reveal to ourselves

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:84%
what has yet to come to
the surface and be healed.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually functioning,
just like the nightmare

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:84%
is functioning, to
literally give you

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.210 align:middle line:84%
access to a part of yourself
that's been unseen to yourself.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Transformative gift.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Opportunity to course
correct as well.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't like
how you feel on waking, you--

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:90%
we have the now, the present.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the future is swirling
around and already happening,

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:90%
but these are all potentials.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.700 align:middle line:84%
You can change the
future you are currently

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:90%
attracting with this mindset.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Because a nightmare is
symbolizing something

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
in your waking life that
your intuition has noticed,

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:84%
your heart has noticed,
but you haven't.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:84%
You've been repressing
or denying it.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
But in the dream
state, the intuition

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:90%
is saying enough is enough.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I have to shock you
now because I've

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
tried to tell you before
with gentle dreams of fairies

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and butterflies, and
you've just not noticed.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: So one thing
about nightmares,

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
they are wonderful
because you remember them.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And you immediately
reach for your journal

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.408 align:middle line:90%
or Google or a book.

00:22:26.408 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or one of your books.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.720 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But the best person
to interpret really is you.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I write books simply to
kickstart symbolic thinking.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But I always tell people, you
know deep down, brainstorm.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And as Jung said, the master
of dream interpretation,

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I really, really respected Jung
because his dream theory is

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:90%
really, really empowering.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.350 align:middle line:84%
You just keep that
dream on your mind,

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and sooner or later,
an insight will bubble.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Just let it fester there.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Let it stay there.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:10%
And in a couple
of days, you will

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.700 align:middle line:10%
find that you get an a-ha
moment, a Eureka moment.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:10%
You say, I get it.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't, in the odd
occasion that you don't, just

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:10%
think, well, my
dreaming mind knows,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:10%
and the work is being
done undercover.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:84%
My dreaming mind has got
my best interests at heart.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:90%
It really has.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing the
work undercover,

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:84%
whether that be
cathartic or it's simply

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.150 align:middle line:84%
trying to things out, and it's
trying to work it out for you.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
always say about dreams.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a night--

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a long term relationship.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a one-night stand.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:84%
You've got to sleep with your
dreams every single night.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.362 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Passionately,
truly, madly,

00:23:33.362 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:90%
and deeply to get their message.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Don't just get hung
up on one dream.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Please tune in for the next
gripping installment of you.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also,
even nightmares.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And I want to bring this
up because I fall I know

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:90%
into a more anomalous category.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But nightmares are a
matter of perception.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:84%
What can happen in a dream to
one person that is horrifying

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.368 align:middle line:84%
is not at all
horrifying to another.

00:23:58.368 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give
one example because I

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
don't have nightmares, but I've
had some challenging dreams.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:84%
One of them, and I
may have mentioned

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.330 align:middle line:84%
this last time we were together,
but it's worth mentioning again.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.813 align:middle line:90%
The plane's going down.

00:24:11.813 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm on planes a fair amount.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.850 align:middle line:90%
It's going down.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's going to stop it.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's like my
thought is crap.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think it
was ending today.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.485 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, my optimistic
mind hopped in and said,

00:24:26.485 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:84%
You were always
afraid to skydive.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Now you'll know what it
feels like to freefall.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
You got about 10 seconds to
feel the gift of freefall

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.370 align:middle line:90%
before it's over.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.945 align:middle line:84%
So I just let go and
experience death, a free fall.

00:24:40.945 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: The thing is, though,
Regina, it's interesting.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.975 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting you say that
you don't have nightmares.

00:24:45.975 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I mean,
someone would say

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.900 align:middle line:90%
that's a horrible nightmare.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.358 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah,
but you've learned,

00:24:50.358 --> 00:24:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, with
the work you do,

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.540 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of like your
life's a waking dream.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.160 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about the
unconscious, the inner world,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:84%
daily, day in, day out, and
most of us don't do that.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So you are having an
opportunity to deal

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:84%
with your nightmares, deal with
your shadow in plain sight.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I bring this
up because I know

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.290 align:middle line:84%
there are people
watching this that

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
have a similar kind of
experience, who are steeped

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:84%
in all of this, who question
when something's out of balance.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
You question it and say, oh,
that was a bit of a jerk.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I could have handled
that differently.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing that
constantly in your daily life,

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:84%
just kind of keeping
a check on yourself

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:90%
and keeping it in balance.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.363 align:middle line:84%
It probably doesn't need
to play out as nightmarish.

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: I love this.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
this, because that's

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
a natural extension
of precognitive dream

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
work, in that you start, and
I always encourage people

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:84%
to do that, at the end of the
program, when I work with them,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:84%
is that now, your life
is the waking dream.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Interpret every person you
meet as if it was a dream.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:90%
What is this trying to teach me?

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Where am I reflecting?

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Where am I repressing?

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.920 align:middle line:84%
What is this person
teaching me about myself,

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to realize
that we are all one?

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I love dream
work so much, because it

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:90%
shows that we are not alone.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people feel
alone sometimes,

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
but we're not once we
spiritually awaken.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we realize
that we are all one.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And that when we dream,
everything in the dream

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol of our
mindset and that you can

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.260 align:middle line:90%
do that in your waking life.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Like if someone
triggers you, why?

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.450 align:middle line:84%
What is it within you
that you need to learn?

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.640 align:middle line:84%
If someone says
something you don't like,

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:90%
when have I done that to myself?

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.992 align:middle line:84%
If someone's not
truthful, when am I

00:26:30.992 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:90%
not being truthful to myself?

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a really
magical way to live.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.478 align:middle line:90%
And it also has--

00:26:35.478 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
it's very connecting
because you have

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
great empathy for
other people as well,

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
because they're going through
their own inside out drama too.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.060 align:middle line:90%
You're less judgmental.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.700 align:middle line:84%
You're less
critical, because you

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:84%
know we're all on this
path of understanding

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that we are dreaming beings
having a human experience.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
uniting force in the world.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:56.947 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: We're souls.

00:26:56.947 --> 00:26:58.032 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:58.032 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Soul is
not a part of us.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.407 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
dreams are a part of us.

00:27:01.407 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:90%
We are a soul.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I love
that Einstein once

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:84%
said the greatest thing in
the world we can experience

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.240 align:middle line:90%
is the mysterious.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:90%
That's not the greatest thing.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.830 align:middle line:90%
We are mystery.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, not to
criticize Einstein.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.207 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But I know
what he was saying.

00:27:14.207 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:90%
But we are the mystery.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.382 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's not
something we experience.

00:27:17.382 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:90%
We are living it.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And our daily lives
are a magical opportunity

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.450 align:middle line:90%
to learn about ourselves.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Such a precious gift.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Every single day suck every
bit of meaning out of it.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:84%
See the invisible strings
that are weaving together

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:90%
like a tapestry all the time.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
fall asleep and dream,

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:84%
you'll get a
comment on all that.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't change when
you fall asleep and dream.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:90%
You're still the same person.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:90%
You just see.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's making me
think about my dream last night.

00:27:46.418 --> 00:27:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So I end up in this dream,
where I'm somewhere,

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and I've purchased this
really eccentric chessboard.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the pieces on it
are like old cut glass

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:middle line:84%
goblets for some of the pieces
and all different strange

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.640 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Strange
logic that, isn't it?

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, but that's what
occurred to me is I thought,

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.977 align:middle line:84%
hey, why did I buy
this, because I don't

00:28:05.977 --> 00:28:07.160 align:middle line:90%
have anywhere I can put it?

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.618 align:middle line:84%
I haven't played
chess in 40 years.

00:28:08.618 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But what I just remembered
is at the end of it,

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought, maybe you need to
learn to play chess again.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
what you're just saying.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something
about bringing

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.950 align:middle line:84%
about the need for some real
strategic thinking that's

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.140 align:middle line:90%
coming up.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
just blown past that.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: There is
a tendency sometimes

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.150 align:middle line:84%
when you're in deep in
this work to get trapped

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:34.940 align:middle line:84%
in your head and all ideas and
brainstorming and everything,

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and not to actually
walk the talk

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:90%
and have a strategy and a plan.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:84%
There may be something
coming up that requires

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.227 align:middle line:90%
actual real strategy.

00:28:43.227 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Precision.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah and precision.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Planning.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There we go.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.225 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But of course,
in chess, everything

00:28:48.225 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:90%
turns on a move.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:84%
That you can plan it,
and then the opponent

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.400 align:middle line:90%
can throw a curveball.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
precognitive dreaming again.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.428 align:middle line:84%
It's course
correcting constantly.

00:28:57.428 --> 00:28:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I didn't
write it down, but I will now.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Please write it down.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's something
really-- go ahead.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Please write
down your dreams.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:90%
The healing power of dreams.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:10%
Now this you've written
about in one of your books,

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:10%
and you started with
a very personal story.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:10%
I've noticed this with
people with dementia too.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Dementia is a third
dimensional thing.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:90%
It is not a soul thing.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not a higher mind thing,
for whatever reason it occurs.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about interfacing
with people whose memories are

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.860 align:middle line:84%
going and cognitive function is
going, and tell us your story

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and how dreams can
be so beneficial.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: They can, because
over the last five or six years,

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of not been
too public about this.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:90%
It's deeply personal.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.150 align:middle line:84%
My husband has suffered
serious cognitive decline,

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's dramatically
worse at the moment.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.120 align:middle line:10%
There's been denial
and everything,

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.150 align:middle line:10%
and I have sometimes been on my
knees with despair, thinking,

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.440 align:middle line:10%
why can't love heal?

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:10%
I believe in all
this spiritual stuff.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:10%
Why can't I help him?

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.980 align:middle line:90%
He's going through this--

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.430 align:middle line:84%
His soul is slowly
leaving his body.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't recognize
the person now that I

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.090 align:middle line:84%
have, is like a
vulnerable child,

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:84%
three-year-old that
I have to care for.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of my books,
actually, the genesis of it,

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:84%
The Dream Cure,
was I fell asleep

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and prayed for help from my
dreaming mind to help me.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And what happened the next
morning is I had like 1,001

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:27.970 align:middle line:90%
dreams on my mind.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It was like my
brain was on fire.

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And some of those dreams led
to book titles or whatever.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But what it showed
me, it was a reminder.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Again, I have the strength.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I can turn this
pain into purpose.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I am being called
to be, to evolve.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe I've
got too comfortable.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do think that
sometimes people with dementia

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, that the
people around them,

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:90%
they're calling them to grow.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I have to find more
unconditional love.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.603 align:middle line:90%
I have to find more patience.

00:30:56.603 --> 00:30:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I have to find
more understanding.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
passion, everything.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.365 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I've written about
all these things, but have I

00:31:01.365 --> 00:31:03.950 align:middle line:90%
just been theorizing?

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm having to really at
this grand old age in my life.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:10%
And I now have to find--

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How many
people watching or going

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:10%
through this with loved ones.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.520 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.020 align:middle line:10%
I have to find one's
inner strength.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.950 align:middle line:10%
And dream work helps because
when I feel low, and I do,

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:10%
I am reminded that I have an
inner power, an inner world,

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.370 align:middle line:10%
and that world is strong,
and powerful, and infinite,

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:10%
and loving, and I
will pull through it.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:90%
I will transcend this.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And all I can do
at the moment, I've

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.410 align:middle line:84%
kind of let go of the
desire to control as well.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you do think,
I can fix this.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.050 align:middle line:90%
I can fix this.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.640 align:middle line:90%
We all think we can fix this.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I've had to let go, like you
said with your planes dream.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:41.920 align:middle line:90%
I've had to let go.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:90%
This is out of my hands.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:90%
This is, in a way, his drama.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
My role is the carer,
and it's a privilege

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.840 align:middle line:84%
to do that, to try and
help him as much as I can.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I've had to let go
and just reach deep

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:84%
for an unconditional love
I didn't think I had.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:90%
And in the process, awaken more.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Because life is constant
growth and awakening.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then
there's this beauty

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.610 align:middle line:84%
of dreams which are
connecting in with their soul.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whole different story.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
other layer of people

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.530 align:middle line:84%
who may know someone, would be
very close to a dear person,

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:84%
who's losing their potential,
their mental faculties, so

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:84%
to speak, and suffering
from dementia.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:24.810 align:middle line:90%
You can dream with them.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: You can.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.507 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this was pointed out,
this is amazing synchronicity,

00:32:28.507 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:84%
that a couple of months
ago, I was connected

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.643 align:middle line:84%
to Robert Hass, whose wife
also is suffering from this,

00:32:32.643 --> 00:32:33.810 align:middle line:90%
and he's very open about it.

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And he lucid dreams,
and he talks to her

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.678 align:middle line:90%
in the lucid dream state.

00:32:37.678 --> 00:32:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was encouraging me
to try and do the same.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I haven't yet been able to
achieve it but watch this space.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I have dreamed about my husband.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But in the dreams, I'm
not able to talk to him.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.140 align:middle line:84%
He's very much like,
often, the dreams

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I have about him,
that I'm losing him,

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.360 align:middle line:90%
which is so symbolic, isn't it?

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.200 align:middle line:90%
I can't find him.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Where's he gone?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.240 align:middle line:90%
That kind of dream.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:90%
But I'm working towards how.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And I will get there
when I can actually

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.050 align:middle line:84%
have a conversation
with his soul,

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.430 align:middle line:84%
that I can't have
in waking life now.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think lucid dream work,
it's been proven with veterans,

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:08.850 align:middle line:90%
hasn't it?

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And people suffering
incredible trauma

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that they can heal it in
the lucid dream state.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure, actually, it could
be used for carers of people

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
with dementia, Parkinson's,
all these dreadful diseases,

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually have
a connection in spirit

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:90%
with a loved one.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that goes for
people who you've not just

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:84%
lost through
dementia but whom we

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.970 align:middle line:84%
may have lost in our lives, who
may have, for whatever reason,

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:90%
chosen to leave our lives.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Lot of families are
being fractured now.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:10%
It's epidemic, where
particularly, it's

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.878 align:middle line:10%
almost always the grown kids
pulling away from their parents

00:33:47.878 --> 00:33:50.170 align:middle line:10%
and say, we don't want anything
to do with you anymore.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And taking their kids,
their grandkids and leaving.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:54.877 align:middle line:90%
And it is becoming epidemic.

00:33:54.877 --> 00:33:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I get a lot of
people writing to me about they

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.327 align:middle line:84%
can't see their grandkids
because their parents--

00:33:59.327 --> 00:34:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know so many people.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --disagree with
their views or their lifestyle

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a symptom of so
many people in the world

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.190 align:middle line:90%
are still external.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
They're getting their
validation and their meaning

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:18.610 align:middle line:84%
from the old way of job,
career, popularity, money,

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:19.780 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And if they fall in that
trap, sometimes, they

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.250 align:middle line:10%
can turn against their parents
if their parents are not

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it happen
time and time again,

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.280 align:middle line:90%
and it breaks my heart.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, these children
are on their own journey,

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's all for
their soul evolution.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.469 align:middle line:84%
And the parents, all
the parents can do,

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I think we were talking earlier,
is send unconditional love

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.270 align:middle line:90%
and hope that one day--

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree, but they
do show up in your dreams

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.120 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: They do.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you can be
normal together for a moment.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Or you can talk it over,
or you can see maybe where

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.530 align:middle line:90%
they are in their own journey.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Are they withdrawn and angry?

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Are they open and wanting to
connect again in the dream time?

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.555 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been
experiencing that.

00:35:10.555 --> 00:35:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Absolutely.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
can connect with people

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.840 align:middle line:84%
who are lost to
you in your waking

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.650 align:middle line:90%
hours in the third dimension.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: If some people
are in your heart,

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.940 align:middle line:84%
but they can't be in your
life for whatever reason,

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.170 align:middle line:90%
dream about them.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Because on some level,
on some energetic level,

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:31.670 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the Akashic
realms or the realm of spirit,

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.470 align:middle line:90%
they will sense that healing.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.180 align:middle line:90%
They will sense that connection.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell people as well
who fall out with each other.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.160 align:middle line:10%
Instead of stressing about
it or worrying about it

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.990 align:middle line:10%
or getting angry about it,
to try something different.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Send them love.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And you will notice
a difference.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:90%
You will.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.227 align:middle line:90%
If only within yourself.

00:35:50.227 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If only within dreams.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.185 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And with only within
yourself as well that you let go

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:56.350 align:middle line:84%
of that need to
control what is--

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.570 align:middle line:84%
You cannot control what
other people think or feel,

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and it is a big error to
think that you ever can.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:84%
All you can do is show up with
integrity and honesty, humility,

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and unconditional
love and an open mind.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the best thing
you can do for yourself,

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.460 align:middle line:90%
for others and the planet.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.640 align:middle line:84%
The more of us do that, the
more of a beautiful world

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.440 align:middle line:90%
it will be in.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.957 align:middle line:84%
I believe your Future
Human, that amazing book--

00:36:20.957 --> 00:36:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, thank
you, when Lee and I did.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:24.800 align:middle line:84%
You talk about
that all the time,

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.960 align:middle line:84%
that that's the way to
show up for the future.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.750 align:middle line:84%
That's the potential
future that you

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:32.050 align:middle line:84%
want to attract, you and Lee,
through the work you've done.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's the potential future
that I'm doing everything

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.560 align:middle line:84%
in my power, whether it's
writing books, doing media,

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.180 align:middle line:84%
flying here to have the
blessing to talk to Gaia,

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.950 align:middle line:90%
who see the good in people.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I am, I'm trying
to spread that message.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:50.500 align:middle line:84%
There is healing power
in unconditional love.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Love is the greatest
force in the world.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:58.180 align:middle line:84%
It can transcend time and
space, perhaps even life, death,

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.660 align:middle line:90%
hate, evil itself.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.703 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, because
you've written so many books

00:37:03.703 --> 00:37:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and because we can
only talk, we're just

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.940 align:middle line:90%
touching on a couple of them.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.510 align:middle line:84%
There's another one you've
done, but you talk in it

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:13.630 align:middle line:84%
about the relationship between
souls who travel together,

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:84%
your twin flame soul, that may
have split apart at one point,

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.070 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
philosophy you buy into.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And is journeying as male or
female, different timelines,

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.200 align:middle line:84%
comes back together
with all this experience

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.920 align:middle line:90%
into an integrated being.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But the dreaming in that state,
and I'm only setting this up

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.883 align:middle line:90%
for next time you fly here.

00:37:31.883 --> 00:37:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Twin flames.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, twin flames.

00:37:33.925 --> 00:37:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Because we're almost--

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I've got a
whole new take on that.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know you do.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
state right now

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.740 align:middle line:84%
is that I want to do a whole
show on all of that with you

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.962 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I've got
a novel as well.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I've written a first novel.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.422 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk about that.

00:37:49.422 --> 00:37:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But before we go, we still
have time for one more subject,

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.460 align:middle line:90%
and that is dreamscaping.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Like landscaping, isn't it?

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically,
it's dream incubation.

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:04.800 align:middle line:84%
It's before you go to
sleep at night, writing

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:84%
a letter of intention,
either with your thoughts

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.260 align:middle line:84%
or with words, of what
you want to dream about

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.270 align:middle line:84%
or what question
you want answered,

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.120 align:middle line:84%
bearing in mind
that answers aren't

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.330 align:middle line:90%
going to bring you fulfillment.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.010 align:middle line:84%
More and more
questions will come

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.470 align:middle line:84%
because your growth is
in asking the questions

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and in what
understanding you come.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.240 align:middle line:90%
But you can do that.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just before you go to sleep
at night, ask your dreaming mind

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:90%
a question.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Say, show me, help
me understand what

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I need to do for my future
personal and spiritual growth.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Your dreaming mind will
love that conversation,

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.500 align:middle line:90%
and it will deliver.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.687 align:middle line:90%
Trust it, believe in it.

00:38:42.687 --> 00:38:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Give it a little time.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.310 align:middle line:90%
It may not happen the first day.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: No.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.785 align:middle line:84%
It especially depends on your
upbringing and your beliefs.

00:38:48.785 --> 00:38:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I suspect your
listeners, a lot of them

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.230 align:middle line:84%
are very tuned in
to their intuition

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.230 align:middle line:90%
and their dreaming mind.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.670 align:middle line:90%
So it will be much easier.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But we tend to not
think that we have

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:90%
any control over our dreams.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We do have a certain
amount of control.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I always equate it
to being a sailor.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.180 align:middle line:84%
You can learn to sail the seas,
but you can never really control

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:90%
the seas or the ocean.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.090 align:middle line:90%
You can learn--

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.670 align:middle line:84%
What dream incubation
and lucid dreaming

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:84%
give you is if you're in a
canoe, it gives you the oar.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But still,
the ocean is a mystery

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that you can never completely
control or understand.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But you can learn
to navigate it.

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.195 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And all
these techniques are.

00:39:30.195 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, when you
do, life becomes so interesting.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.730 align:middle line:84%
You suddenly think, you
wake up in the morning, oh.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.410 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Why did I dream about that?

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.297 align:middle line:84%
A couple of weeks ago, I kept
dreaming of Hugh Bonneville,

00:39:44.297 --> 00:39:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'd never watched
the Paddington movies.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why I brought
you a Paddington Bear.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love that
little Paddington Bear.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And I loved
the message of that.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And I always dismissed
it, oh, it's nonsense.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Nonsense movie.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's really good.

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Because Paddington
sees the good.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And everything
is so sweet and gentle.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And it's humble
and sweet and open.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:59.703 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love my little bear.

00:39:59.703 --> 00:40:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to go right
next to my little gnome.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But it was a
message telling me, come on.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.750 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I get disillusioned
with the UK, I think,

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:06.892 align:middle line:90%
oh, we're a bit cynical.

00:40:06.892 --> 00:40:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Things are going wrong.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:09.995 align:middle line:84%
And I think, well, no,
the UK produced that.

00:40:09.995 --> 00:40:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: There's
dreaming minds.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
putting people like you

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.030 align:middle line:90%
on mainstream TV.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Absolutely.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Be thankful for that.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And there's
dreaming minds behind that.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have one more thing
to talk about before we go here.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is you've done
your first work of fiction.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.420 align:middle line:10%
And what's it called?

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.490 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEUNG: NightBorn.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.972 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: NightBorn.

00:40:26.972 --> 00:40:28.430 align:middle line:10%
This is exciting,
and I'll tell you

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:29.880 align:middle line:10%
why I think it's so exciting.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.435 align:middle line:10%
One, you have a
great imagination.

00:40:31.435 --> 00:40:33.330 align:middle line:84%
You know dreams inside
out and backward.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.560 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you a chance to
talk about the things that

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.650 align:middle line:84%
are on the edgier side, which
you can't necessarily put out,

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.940 align:middle line:84%
the publishers may not want
you to put out in the books

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.690 align:middle line:90%
that you produce for the public.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: No.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:48.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit more
shocking this way.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But it really is a
novel of integration.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:54.410 align:middle line:10%
It's dealing with the
persona, the shadow, the anima

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.680 align:middle line:10%
or the animus, and how the
main character deals with that.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.628 align:middle line:10%
And as I said--

00:40:59.628 --> 00:41:01.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Give us
the elevator pitch,

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.450 align:middle line:10%
the synopsis, just the
synopsis like on the back.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:04.345 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's just
a fun experiment.

00:41:04.345 --> 00:41:05.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:41:05.303 --> 00:41:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But just tell us
about this character.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: A woman wakes
up in the morning,

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, everybody's
dreaming about her.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine that, if you
woke up, and people said, oh,

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.280 align:middle line:90%
my goodness--

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I saw you last night.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.257 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that has
been done before,

00:41:17.257 --> 00:41:18.920 align:middle line:84%
but I thought that
the way it was done,

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.900 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't enough importance
given to dream work.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.260 align:middle line:84%
That scenario has
happened before.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.427 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're dreaming
about it and go ahead.

00:41:28.427 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Give us a little more.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's a Nicolas
Cage movie, I think,

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.983 align:middle line:84%
when everybody was
dreaming about him.

00:41:31.983 --> 00:41:33.910 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't explore
the power of dream work.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this is
a missed opportunity.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I'm going to do
it from a female point of view.

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.650 align:middle line:84%
A reclusive psychology
professor who's deep into Jung.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I had
tremendous fun with it.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it will
win any literary awards,

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:84%
but it's a way also
of reaching people.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm all about reaching
different audiences.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I love talking to people who
aren't actually necessarily

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.160 align:middle line:90%
in tune with it.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.320 align:middle line:90%
I do actually get a great--

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.187 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of BBC
interviews as well, where

00:42:00.187 --> 00:42:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I have to be very
balanced, and people

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.460 align:middle line:84%
who are going to come
with a skepticism.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.900 align:middle line:84%
This was a way to maybe
reach more mainstream.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.750 align:middle line:84%
People who normally wouldn't
read my nonfiction books.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Because let's face it these
days, you've got Gaia.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.558 align:middle line:84%
You've got wonderful
interviews like you're doing--

00:42:14.558 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
read your fiction book.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.425 align:middle line:84%
I love where imagination
boosts these concepts.

00:42:18.425 --> 00:42:20.008 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEUNG: The way
reading is going now

00:42:20.008 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:10%
with the advent of
AI and everything,

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.705 align:middle line:10%
there's so much material
that people don't actually

00:42:23.705 --> 00:42:26.710 align:middle line:10%
have to go to nonfiction books
anymore to get the goods.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.530 align:middle line:10%
But fiction is still
something that someone

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:33.193 align:middle line:10%
who's maybe not drawn to the
nonfiction will lean into.
