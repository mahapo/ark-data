>> I've always found that
when life presents change,

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:25.893 align:middle line:84%
especially big changes, I begin
searching for music to carry me

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:28.095 align:middle line:84%
through to the other
side, new music.

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.931 align:middle line:84%
On a much larger scale,
using music for change

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.834 align:middle line:84%
and revolution became the
passion of Hank Shocklee,

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.503 align:middle line:84%
a top producer in
the world of rap.

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:37.938 align:middle line:84%
His most well-known
group was Public Enemy

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:40.474 align:middle line:84%
who made the middle-class
white man shudder

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:42.776 align:middle line:84%
but empowered a generation
of black youth

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.913 align:middle line:84%
to reject the prevailing system
which was not working for them.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.616 align:middle line:84%
Hank is with us today to
talk about the ability

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:51.152 align:middle line:90%
of music to shift perception.

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:53.687 align:middle line:84%
And I just have to right
off the top toss something

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.089 align:middle line:90%
out to you here.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.225 align:middle line:84%
Alex Grey, he's the
visionary artist --

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.161 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
seen any of his work --

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:02.863 align:middle line:84%
but he's the one that shows
the kind of internal workings

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:04.231 align:middle line:90%
of the human being, you know,

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:84%
with the meridians
running through.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.836 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing him one time
a few years ago and he said

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:14.241 align:middle line:84%
to me that his opinion, the rap
artists were now the new shamans

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:90%
of society.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.747 align:middle line:84%
Now, that -- at the time I was
trying to get my mind around it,

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:20.948 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quite know
what he meant.

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But you probably do
know what he meant.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.287 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what you think
he was saying at the time

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:29.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, I think
that, you know, for me,

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:30.958 align:middle line:90%
I think that rap has --

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:36.864 align:middle line:84%
it offers an expression that's
not found in R and B or found

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:84%
in either music that
-- perhaps singers.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.003 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
artist now can express more

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:44.805 align:middle line:90%
so they can say more things.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:48.409 align:middle line:84%
And so -- and so I guess that it
empowered them to speak about,

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.013 align:middle line:84%
you know, situations of
whatever is going on in the hood

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:57.016 align:middle line:84%
or whether or not the -- the
injustice that was going on.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.321 align:middle line:84%
So I guess, yeah, in that
respect, I guess, yeah,

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.223 align:middle line:84%
to me that would
be a modern-day --

00:02:02.223 --> 00:02:06.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was authentic,
speaking truth, speaking really

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:10.664 align:middle line:84%
from the heart and the
head both, and what --

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I heard a little bit
of your talk yesterday

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.403 align:middle line:84%
and you gave a bit of background
in terms of the influences

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.739 align:middle line:84%
in your life, and we're going
to go into that in a little bit.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.877 align:middle line:84%
But what was it that made you
throw yourself into the world

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:25.012 align:middle line:90%
of helping produce these artists

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:27.248 align:middle line:84%
to speak their messages
through rap?

00:02:27.248 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's kind of
like I wanted to --

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.653 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be an artist
but I'm not an artist, so --

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:37.057 align:middle line:84%
but I'm more of a producer
behind the scenes, but I wanted

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
to produce them because I --
their vision is my vision.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.966 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I started working
with Chuck, you know -- he --

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:50.004 align:middle line:84%
to me, Chuck was like
a counterpart to me.

00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:54.775 align:middle line:84%
He was like my visionary,
my vocalist if you would.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:59.046 align:middle line:84%
He expressed what I wanted
to talk about deep inside.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.781 align:middle line:84%
So I got a chance
to kind of like work

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:02.683 align:middle line:90%
with him and build with him.

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.218 align:middle line:90%
And I mentor, you know.

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:08.055 align:middle line:84%
So I mentor a lot of artists
before I even work with them

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:11.759 align:middle line:84%
so we get a chance to
build on ideas and concepts

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.295 align:middle line:84%
and understand what
relationships are and some

00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:17.364 align:middle line:84%
of the things that need to be
dealt with in the community.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.634 align:middle line:84%
And we try to, you know,
deal with those things music.

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:21.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.404 align:middle line:90%
The movie "8 Mile."

00:03:23.404 --> 00:03:24.238 align:middle line:90%
"8 Miles"?

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:25.472 align:middle line:90%
"8 Mile"? << Uh-huh.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:28.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. That was the
first time I really got it.

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:31.679 align:middle line:84%
I mean up to that time, I
didn't understand the art form

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.812 align:middle line:90%
that well.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.549 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a West Coast
middle-aged white woman

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.451 align:middle line:84%
and I have a lot of
musical interest,

00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:38.786 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't really get it.

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:43.824 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the amount
of heart and wit and poetry

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:47.695 align:middle line:84%
and just -- just quick
wittedness that was behind it,

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:49.496 align:middle line:84%
it gave me a new
appreciation for it.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.465 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to find
out from your perspective,

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.634 align:middle line:84%
when you were trying
to find artists,

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:56.203 align:middle line:90%
what are these guys like?

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:84%
What do you look for to find
someone that has that intense

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.842 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence and
ability to express?

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:05.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, the first
thing I look for is sound.

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:08.182 align:middle line:84%
Everything to me comes
-- starts with the sound.

00:04:08.182 --> 00:04:11.218 align:middle line:84%
And I look for a voice
that's different and unique.

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I look for,
you know, the fact that,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.722 align:middle line:90%
like you said, the quick wit.

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:16.957 align:middle line:84%
I look for, you know,
your metaphors.

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.159 align:middle line:84%
I look for things
that they can --

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.696 align:middle line:84%
they can put together,
relationships.

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.898 align:middle line:84%
You know, they can take --
they can take what is --

00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:27.568 align:middle line:84%
what is visual and
communicate it

00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:30.871 align:middle line:84%
and verbalize what
they see every day.

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.306 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
kinds of things.

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.808 align:middle line:84%
And when you're talking about
with the "8 Mile" situation,

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:37.378 align:middle line:84%
what, you know, we
produce things --

00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:40.347 align:middle line:84%
they call those "open mics," and
what they are is like they --

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:41.382 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like a competition.

00:04:41.382 --> 00:04:42.249 align:middle line:90%
It's a sound off.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:43.517 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:46.887 align:middle line:84%
And those things are the
classic ways of finding really,

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:49.723 align:middle line:84%
really good talent, because
anybody that can kind a

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
like battle their way in with
a bunch of other rappers,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.396 align:middle line:84%
those are the guys that
you want to go after.

00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:56.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, and that's -- I mean,

00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:58.665 align:middle line:84%
what an exciting
process to go through.

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:00.134 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's it like?

00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:02.703 align:middle line:84%
I mean, give me an idea of a few
of the people who were are just

00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:04.838 align:middle line:90%
so smart it blew your mind.

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's talk
about Chuck, you know.

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:12.446 align:middle line:84%
When I found Chuck, I was
at a Adelphi University --

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:17.017 align:middle line:84%
just a frat party, and in that
time, you know, there was a lot

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:18.552 align:middle line:90%
of emcees that they had.

00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:20.521 align:middle line:84%
When they play a certain
record, like when they play

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:24.291 align:middle line:84%
"Good Times," all the
emcees would want to rhyme.

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And so all these emcees
are rhyming and there's

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.061 align:middle line:90%
about a dozen of them rhyming.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.463 align:middle line:90%
They was all terrible.

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:31.765 align:middle line:84%
And so when I heard
Chuck, Chuck came

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:35.469 align:middle line:84%
and actually just did an
announcement for another event

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:41.008 align:middle line:84%
that was going on, and his
sound and delivery was so crisp

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:44.378 align:middle line:84%
and so precise that I went
over to him and I said, "Look.

00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:47.281 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see if you
wanted to be an emcee

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:49.416 align:middle line:90%
in my -- do my DJ outfit."

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:50.818 align:middle line:90%
He said, "I don't know.

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:52.219 align:middle line:90%
We'll see."

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.589 align:middle line:84%
And so it took me like a year
to convince him to be an emcee.

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.257 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
point I consider

00:05:57.257 --> 00:05:59.026 align:middle line:90%
that to be the training grounds.

00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:03.831 align:middle line:84%
And then from then, he kind of,
like, you know, we learned a lot

00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:08.268 align:middle line:84%
about development and how to
show and how to be an emcee

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:11.238 align:middle line:84%
and how to keep the crowd going
and the things that needs to be,

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:12.339 align:middle line:90%
you know, things that they --

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:16.043 align:middle line:84%
you need to do to be
a charismatic showman.

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.212 align:middle line:84%
>> So really they're
coming more to the area

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:19.947 align:middle line:90%
of poetry than anything else.

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:22.416 align:middle line:84%
These guys are more
poets then singers.

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, right?

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.685 align:middle line:90%
>> I think you have to be.

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:27.855 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to be able
to take what is every --

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:31.225 align:middle line:84%
mundane, everyday
life and glamorize it,

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:34.161 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, put
it in a poetic fashion

00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
so that people would get
it and they wouldn't --

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.065 align:middle line:84%
and it would be entertaining
to them.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.467 align:middle line:90%
And I think that that's --

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:43.604 align:middle line:84%
and to me, I always look for
poets first, because I think

00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:47.274 align:middle line:84%
that poetry is -- if
you're a good poet,

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
then you could be a
sensational rapper.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.711 align:middle line:90%
It's just because I think

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
that the tendencies are
pretty much the same

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We were talking off-camera
at dinner last night,

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.552 align:middle line:84%
just kind of seeing
where we wanted --

00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:00.187 align:middle line:84%
what we wanted to
talk about today,

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:01.822 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things
you mentioned,

00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:04.124 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people listen to rap,
especially like I mentioned

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:06.894 align:middle line:84%
in my open, when Public
Enemy came out, I mean,

00:07:06.894 --> 00:07:09.463 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of white people
who were like, oh, my God.

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:10.297 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:11.532 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen to us?

00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Right? It was scary.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.602 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time,
you're saying, if you're looking

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:19.006 align:middle line:84%
at really toxic music,
go to the Top 40.

00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:20.908 align:middle line:90%
What did you mean by that?

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:24.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that today,
a lot of music is not --

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:27.247 align:middle line:84%
is not communicating what
the community is about,

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:28.882 align:middle line:90%
or not reflecting the community.

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:31.985 align:middle line:84%
And if you look back at the
early, you know, '70s records,

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:34.821 align:middle line:84%
and even the '60s records,
all those records, you know,

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:84%
they defined an era because
they reflected what was going

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.094 align:middle line:90%
on in the community.

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:42.963 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
you know, artists

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:48.267 align:middle line:84%
and great music reflects
the community's values.

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:51.104 align:middle line:84%
And I think that today
that doesn't happen.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:54.708 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that the
values are being projected

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:58.245 align:middle line:84%
so you're getting this kind of
hyper-reality, this fake reality

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:01.815 align:middle line:84%
of artists that's projecting
these lavish lifestyle

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
that really doesn't -- that
doesn't happen in the community.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.724 align:middle line:84%
>> I think everybody can
relate to the inauthenticity

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and falseness of
what's being projected.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So that is trumped up for
purpose, narcotization,

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.132 align:middle line:84%
part of the narcotization
of the masses.

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:20.367 align:middle line:90%
>> It's part of selling.

00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:22.769 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, today
it's all about advertising.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:25.038 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we was -- you
know, when we were coming

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:29.476 align:middle line:84%
up in the time of the early
part of rap, it was -- it was --

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:34.247 align:middle line:84%
it was not cool to be
associated with products.

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It was not cool to advertise.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.719 align:middle line:84%
And matter of fact, it
was just the opposite:

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.522 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to be
against the system.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.091 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to be
against advertising.

00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:45.525 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to be
against products.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.127 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to be
for the community.

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to be for something
that stood greater than --

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:55.435 align:middle line:84%
than just selling and
just commercialism.

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:57.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet at the same time,
you were so successful

00:08:57.738 --> 00:09:00.207 align:middle line:84%
in your efforts that it
started looking like that

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:04.044 align:middle line:84%
to the outside; lots of success,
lots of money, and so forth.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.513 align:middle line:84%
>> But -- and so then
what that leads us to --

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:09.883 align:middle line:84%
to the next level, which now
we start to talk about that.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, you know, for
me, good art doesn't really talk

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.323 align:middle line:84%
about what it has, the
money that it's about.

00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:19.426 align:middle line:84%
I think good art always talks
about issues and problems,

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:21.628 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't matter
how much money we have,

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:22.729 align:middle line:90%
we all want to have --

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.032 align:middle line:84%
we all have issues and
we all have problems

00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:26.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Right. No, that's true.

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:29.169 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's made abundantly
clear in all the tabloids.

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:31.204 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and a lot
of the rap artists,

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:32.606 align:middle line:90%
like a lot of the athletes,

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:35.676 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of movie stars made
their way to the top of that.

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:38.312 align:middle line:84%
And so what was it like dealing
with that behind the scenes

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:84%
where you have people
who come in,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.481 align:middle line:90%
they're -- they have purpose?

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:44.985 align:middle line:84%
First of all, were you looking
for a [cough] -- excuse me --

00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:49.122 align:middle line:84%
a tone that had kind of
some hunger or anger to it

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:50.223 align:middle line:90%
to really project

00:09:50.223 --> 00:09:52.793 align:middle line:84%
that information forward
in an authentic way?

00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:54.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was looking
for honesty.

00:09:54.695 --> 00:09:55.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that the
first thing you look

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.666 align:middle line:84%
for in any situation is,
you want to make sure

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:02.002 align:middle line:84%
that whatever the artist that
you're working with comes

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:03.804 align:middle line:90%
across as honest as possible.

00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:07.474 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're an angry
person and that's your --

00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:11.078 align:middle line:84%
and that's your thing, well,
then I want to accentuate that.

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:13.814 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're --
if comedy is your thing,

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:15.415 align:middle line:90%
then we want to accentuate that.

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:19.553 align:middle line:84%
You know, if being cool and
being smooth and debonair

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:21.688 align:middle line:84%
and being a ladies'
man is your thing,

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that's what you want
to accentuate.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.491 align:middle line:90%
You don't -- you want to --

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:27.961 align:middle line:84%
you want to highlight the
strong points of any artist,

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:31.732 align:middle line:84%
and you want to eliminate all
those weak points, if you would.

00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:34.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And so it seemed
like that particular genre,

00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.136 align:middle line:84%
because you were
looking to -- as an --

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.305 align:middle line:84%
you said initially that
you did it is an experiment

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.607 align:middle line:84%
to see how it would affect kids
if it would kind of get them

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:84%
up to taking some kind of
responsibility, action,

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.712 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot in their own lives.

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:50.317 align:middle line:84%
And so that seems that anger
is oftentimes a useful kind

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:52.052 align:middle line:90%
of motivating force for people.

00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:53.987 align:middle line:84%
And if you're talking
about the black community,

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.822 align:middle line:90%
the inner-city black community,

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.191 align:middle line:84%
there's justifiable
reason to be pretty angry.

00:10:58.191 --> 00:10:59.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we were angry.

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.695 align:middle line:84%
>> We were angry
as kids coming up.

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:04.297 align:middle line:84%
We were angry because the system
wasn't treating us fairly.

00:11:04.297 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:84%
We was angry because our
parents had to work two

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.603 align:middle line:84%
and three jobs just to
put food on the table.

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:12.005 align:middle line:84%
And we was angry because
the community was -- was --

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.774 align:middle line:84%
was impoverished with
drugs and all kinds

00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:16.009 align:middle line:90%
of things that was going on.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:20.547 align:middle line:84%
I mean these are things that we
see every day that affects us.

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:22.582 align:middle line:84%
You know, we didn't like
the fact that we had

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:26.486 align:middle line:84%
to learn certain --
certain things in school

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:28.188 align:middle line:84%
that we were taught
that had nothing

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.756 align:middle line:90%
to do with our experience.

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.091 align:middle line:84%
>> Totally irrelevant
to your lives.

00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:31.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.727 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, you know.

00:11:33.727 --> 00:11:35.762 align:middle line:90%
And I -- you have to understand.

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:38.365 align:middle line:84%
I didn't grow up in
a city in the hood.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:42.135 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a suburb -- in the
suburbs, and so we had to deal

00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:44.504 align:middle line:90%
with racism as a -- as a --

00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:47.841 align:middle line:84%
as a force that was
against us every day.

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:50.777 align:middle line:84%
>> And in that sense that has
to be true where if you're

00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:54.481 align:middle line:84%
in the inner-city, at least
you're accepted by your friends

00:11:54.481 --> 00:11:56.249 align:middle line:84%
and your relatives
and associates.

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:57.984 align:middle line:90%
But not so in the suburbs, huh?

00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:01.888 align:middle line:84%
>> No. So -- so therefore,
that gave us a different kind

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:07.661 align:middle line:84%
of anger, and it taught us a lot
about how to control that anger

00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:11.431 align:middle line:84%
and how -- you know, or how
to find ways of channeling

00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:14.434 align:middle line:90%
that anger into other things,

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:17.537 align:middle line:84%
and so it teaches
you to organize.

00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:19.873 align:middle line:84%
It teaches you to do things
to teach you, you know,

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
we've learned from our
black American experience

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
that we would have at the
Adelphi University where we --

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.051 align:middle line:84%
where we would take all the --
all the kids from the same hoods

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:34.554 align:middle line:84%
or the same areas in the
suburbs and bring them together

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:37.123 align:middle line:84%
in a summer camp program
where they can learn --

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.125 align:middle line:84%
where we can learn
about ourselves.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:43.563 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very key thing
for, you know, for us because,

00:12:43.563 --> 00:12:46.299 align:middle line:84%
you know, we didn't learn
about ourselves in school.

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:48.869 align:middle line:84%
We had to -- those are things --
those were subjects that we had

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:51.705 align:middle line:84%
to learn about -- we had
to learn about history --

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:54.074 align:middle line:90%
that the white histories.

00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:55.542 align:middle line:90%
European histories.

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:58.578 align:middle line:84%
We had to learn about those
histories and we never learned

00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:01.147 align:middle line:84%
about black or African
histories.

00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:06.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. And so that anger
really was a fuel that was used

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:08.822 align:middle line:84%
to propel the poetry
of a lot of the men

00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:12.192 align:middle line:84%
that you ultimately signed
and started producing for.

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:13.894 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened
over their careers

00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:15.729 align:middle line:84%
when they started
getting traction

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and they started
becoming very popular?

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:84%
With a did they stay close
to the authentic juice

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.436 align:middle line:84%
that started the whole thing,
or was there a corruption

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:25.805 align:middle line:84%
that usually happens
with fame and money?

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
very good question.

00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:31.478 align:middle line:84%
And what happens a lot
of times is that when --

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:36.349 align:middle line:84%
now when we become accepted,
that's a whole other issue

00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:40.020 align:middle line:84%
to deal with, because now, you
know, people always say that,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.322 align:middle line:84%
you know, do people
change or do the --

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.558 align:middle line:84%
or do the situations
change around you

00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:45.992 align:middle line:90%
that forces you to change?

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.061 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot
of times, you know,

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:49.963 align:middle line:90%
your surroundings change.

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:55.268 align:middle line:84%
And so now -- now these artists
who've never dealt with success

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:59.272 align:middle line:84%
at that level -- and meaning
success is being acceptedness,

00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:00.974 align:middle line:84%
they'd never dealt
with that, so now --

00:14:00.974 --> 00:14:02.142 align:middle line:90%
>> And adulation.

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:04.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly -- so now
it's coming back at them.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.246 align:middle line:84%
And for people who
have never dealt

00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:08.348 align:middle line:84%
with it before have all
different types of ways

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.749 align:middle line:90%
that they deal with it.

00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:13.053 align:middle line:84%
Some -- you know, some -- you
know, don't deal with it all.

00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:17.424 align:middle line:84%
Some go into what I consider
reverse mode where they --

00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:19.626 align:middle line:84%
were they do everything
the opposite

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:21.428 align:middle line:84%
of what they should
be doing, you know,

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:23.129 align:middle line:90%
which becomes self-destructive.

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:26.066 align:middle line:84%
You know, and then some people
just decide to take it on

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and take on a new persona from
that level, and I'm gonna --

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.574 align:middle line:84%
instead of me dealing with it,
I'm going to bathe myself in it.

00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bask in that --
in this glory, and I'm going

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.445 align:middle line:90%
to constantly keep -- I mean,

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:40.780 align:middle line:84%
so now I've a big head
about what I'm doing.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.718 align:middle line:84%
Now I think I'm the -- I'm
the end-all and be-all.

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:47.253 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, you
know, that happens as well.

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:48.555 align:middle line:90%
But it --

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.623 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not -- that's
not exclusive to musicians.

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:51.624 align:middle line:90%
That's human nature.

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:52.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:53.927 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a choice to
make when you're confronted

00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:55.762 align:middle line:90%
with success, and as you say,

00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:57.564 align:middle line:84%
most people don't
have the opportunity

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.265 align:middle line:84%
to make those decisions
in that way.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:01.501 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think that success --

00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:04.604 align:middle line:84%
you know, people think that
success, you know, ruins you.

00:15:04.604 --> 00:15:06.773 align:middle line:84%
I think that success
highlights it.

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:10.643 align:middle line:84%
I think it brings out your
true nature, because --

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:15.415 align:middle line:84%
because now you don't have
-- you can't hide it now.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.684 align:middle line:84%
Now it's going -- it's
going to allow itself

00:15:17.684 --> 00:15:19.319 align:middle line:90%
to flow out naturally.

00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:22.188 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems that you've been
able to kind of keep your head.

00:15:22.188 --> 00:15:24.357 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you look you up
online, you don't have a bunch

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:26.059 align:middle line:84%
of scandals surrounding
you or anything.

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:28.495 align:middle line:84%
How you were able to keep your
own head through all of this?

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:30.764 align:middle line:84%
What was your grounding
principle?

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:33.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Man, that's another
good question.

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I just think I've -- I've
-- I'm all about community.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:45.812 align:middle line:84%
I'm all about the development
of communities and self.

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:50.517 align:middle line:84%
And keeping a level head, it's
because when you look around,

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:54.654 align:middle line:84%
there's so many things that are
wrong that hasn't been fixed.

00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:56.723 align:middle line:84%
And -- and there's
always something

00:15:56.723 --> 00:15:58.058 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be fixed.

00:15:58.058 --> 00:16:02.062 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, for me, it's
nothing to get bigheaded about.

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:06.232 align:middle line:84%
It's, I'm -- I feel like I'm on
a mission to change the planet

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:09.736 align:middle line:84%
and to create a higher
consciousness with everyone.

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:13.606 align:middle line:84%
And I just happen to
use music as my tool

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:16.509 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I'm --
that's what I'm good at.

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
But that's -- but that's
something that's dear

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.949 align:middle line:84%
to me that's always been with
me, that's been instilled

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:24.584 align:middle line:90%
to me from my grandmother.

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:25.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and through
your parents.

00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into that,
a little bit of history.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.989 align:middle line:84%
And also the history
of this country

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:33.993 align:middle line:84%
and the whole black music
scene from the 19 --

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.728 align:middle line:90%
we'll go from the 1960s forward.

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:38.364 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
let's go back to 1988

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:40.667 align:middle line:84%
and take a little
look at Public Enemy.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:43.169 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And they were
performing on Yo!

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.537 align:middle line:90%
MTV Raps. Okay?

00:16:44.537 --> 00:16:45.605 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:16:45.605 --> 00:16:47.373 align:middle line:84%
>> You understand
until you hear the man,

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
your book of the new school
rap game, writers treat me

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.978 align:middle line:90%
like Coltrane, insane.

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:54.714 align:middle line:84%
Yes to them but to me,
I'm a different kind.

00:16:54.714 --> 00:16:56.382 align:middle line:84%
We're brothers of the
same mind, unblind.

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:59.319 align:middle line:84%
Caught in the middle
and not surrenderin'.

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:01.855 align:middle line:84%
I don't rhyme for
the sake of riddlin',

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.556 align:middle line:90%
some claim that I'm a smuggler.

00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:07.827 align:middle line:84%
Some say I never heard of ya,
a rap burglar, false media.

00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:09.028 align:middle line:90%
We don't need it, do we?

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.531 align:middle line:84%
It's fake that's what
it be to ya, dig me?

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.966 align:middle line:84%
Yo, Terminator X,
step up on the stand

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:15.568 align:middle line:84%
and show these people
what time it is boy.

00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:16.802 align:middle line:90%
Here we go again.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:18.871 align:middle line:84%
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
don't believe the hype.

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:22.442 align:middle line:84%
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
don't believe the hype.

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:24.644 align:middle line:84%
Don't believe the hype,
don't believe the hype.

00:17:24.644 --> 00:17:26.146 align:middle line:90%
Don't believe the hype.

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:28.681 align:middle line:90%
Don't believe the hype.

00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:31.684 align:middle line:90%
Don't believe the hype.

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:33.019 align:middle line:90%
Don't believe the hype.

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:38.324 align:middle line:84%
Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't,

00:17:38.324 --> 00:17:41.327 align:middle line:90%
don't believe the hype.

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:42.262 align:middle line:84%
Everybody say don't
believe the hype.

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:43.062 align:middle line:90%
Say don't believe the hype.

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:43.763 align:middle line:90%
Say don't believe the hype.

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:45.031 align:middle line:90%
Don't believe the hype.

00:17:45.031 --> 00:17:46.032 align:middle line:84%
Say don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't believe the hype.

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Whoa. That's a
blast to the past.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.801 align:middle line:90%
Twenty-five years ago.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.204 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. What's it like for
you watching it now all these

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:51.838 align:middle line:90%
years later?

00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:52.539 align:middle line:90%
I mean --

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:53.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's still good.

00:17:53.306 --> 00:17:54.007 align:middle line:90%
>> -- where's it take you.

00:17:54.007 --> 00:17:54.774 align:middle line:90%
>> It still looks good.

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:55.642 align:middle line:90%
And, you know what?

00:17:55.642 --> 00:17:57.243 align:middle line:90%
It's still relevant, you know.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't believe the hype.

00:17:58.178 --> 00:17:59.345 align:middle line:90%
It's more relevant now.

00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:01.147 align:middle line:84%
I think were more
narcotized now than we were

00:18:01.147 --> 00:18:02.682 align:middle line:84%
when you created
that in the '80s.

00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:03.516 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:04.884 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's all of society.

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:06.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.955 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, and it's funny
because it seems like, you know,

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:11.291 align:middle line:84%
even if you go back
to the '70s records

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:14.661 align:middle line:84%
and the stuff they were saying
in the '60s up until now,

00:18:14.661 --> 00:18:16.996 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't seem much
has changed.

00:18:16.996 --> 00:18:19.566 align:middle line:84%
It seems that we've
got -- we got a lot --

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:21.668 align:middle line:90%
we have lot more technology.

00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:22.869 align:middle line:90%
We've got a lot more success.

00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:25.004 align:middle line:90%
We got a little more glamorous.

00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:25.839 align:middle line:90%
We have things.

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:28.341 align:middle line:90%
But the core is still the same.

00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:31.044 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the same; however, I
would argue it might even --

00:18:31.044 --> 00:18:34.347 align:middle line:84%
we might be a little worse
off right now in the sense

00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:37.917 align:middle line:84%
that at least during those days,
if you are a kid in school,

00:18:37.917 --> 00:18:41.287 align:middle line:84%
any school, anywhere, you
usually had art classes,

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:84%
maybe you had music,
PE, things like that,

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.693 align:middle line:84%
that developed the whole human
being and at least allowed you

00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:48.595 align:middle line:84%
to have a thread
of creativity left.

00:18:48.595 --> 00:18:49.729 align:middle line:90%
That's gone.

00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:51.531 align:middle line:84%
That's been squashed out
in favor of, you know,

00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of the classic
sciences and technology.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.635 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big one.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:59.639 align:middle line:84%
Because for you, creativity
really was what you --

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.674 align:middle line:84%
your whole world was
about creativity.

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:05.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's why the kids now
go to video games is because,

00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:08.081 align:middle line:84%
you know, kids have to have
an out -- have to have an --

00:19:08.081 --> 00:19:10.183 align:middle line:84%
have to have an outlet
expression.

00:19:10.183 --> 00:19:12.051 align:middle line:84%
They have to have
some sort of outlet.

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:15.455 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if you don't
-- if you limit people's outlets

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
of expression, then what
you end up having is,

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.527 align:middle line:84%
you create this drone
society where kids don't --

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:24.764 align:middle line:84%
where people become
insensitive to anything.

00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:25.898 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:27.467 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what you --
so what we're doing now,

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:32.238 align:middle line:84%
we're taking the creativity
away from the youth

00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:34.707 align:middle line:84%
and we're forcing it down
this channel of being

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:37.477 align:middle line:84%
in the video world,
which is some matrix,

00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:39.979 align:middle line:84%
which is a whole
other set of issues.

00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:41.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, big time.

00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And that, it really was what you
were fighting against back then,

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and why you started
this particular genre.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.388 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:50.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. To try to enlighten
and try to -- and to inspire.

00:19:50.757 --> 00:19:53.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. But it was scary to
a lot of people nonetheless.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.828 align:middle line:84%
And one thing women really
were pissed off about is

00:19:55.828 --> 00:19:59.032 align:middle line:84%
that there were a lot of
misogynistic lyrics in some

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:00.667 align:middle line:84%
of the rap -- with
some of the rap groups.

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:01.768 align:middle line:90%
What was your take on that?

00:20:01.768 --> 00:20:04.003 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:08.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that, you
know, I've never really indulged

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:10.743 align:middle line:84%
in any of those type
-- I don't --

00:20:10.743 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't produce those kind of
records or anything, you know,

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.417 align:middle line:84%
but I can -- I can -- what
I can say is that, you know,

00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:19.619 align:middle line:90%
there's always been a battle

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:23.589 align:middle line:84%
in especially the black
community amongst the men

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:24.924 align:middle line:90%
and the women.

00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:28.294 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have -- you know,
we have "Essence Magazine,"

00:20:28.294 --> 00:20:30.196 align:middle line:84%
"Jet Magazine," and
they're all --

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:33.499 align:middle line:84%
is constantly coming back with
these things of "10 Things

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:36.269 align:middle line:84%
that Your Man Don't
Do," you know.

00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:38.671 align:middle line:84%
So they always making
these kind of parallels

00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:39.939 align:middle line:90%
between men and women.

00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:41.874 align:middle line:84%
>> So you had a lot of
friction going on to begin with.

00:20:41.874 --> 00:20:43.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:43.276 --> 00:20:46.846 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, you know, it
does our community a disservice

00:20:46.846 --> 00:20:48.848 align:middle line:84%
when we're fighting
amongst each other,

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:52.085 align:middle line:84%
especially when you're talking
about amongst the sexes.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.887 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that there's
-- I think that there's --

00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:57.523 align:middle line:84%
everybody has situations
and you have issues,

00:20:57.523 --> 00:21:02.028 align:middle line:84%
but I think that harmony is
a better tool for us today

00:21:02.028 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:90%
than us going at each other.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. I think
even some people who,

00:21:05.498 --> 00:21:07.934 align:middle line:84%
like they've live seen "8 Mile"
or whatnot, people like me

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:11.637 align:middle line:84%
who would say, "God, that stuff
is really intensely intelligent

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.172 align:middle line:90%
and interesting and poetic."

00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:15.108 align:middle line:84%
But then you year some
of the rap artists

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.410 align:middle line:84%
that are saying some pretty
nasty stuff about women

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.379 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, I can't
go there anymore,

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:20.947 align:middle line:84%
and then you tune
the whole genre out.

00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:22.915 align:middle line:84%
And I think that happened
with a lot of people.

00:21:22.915 --> 00:21:25.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and that's unfortunate.

00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:26.919 align:middle line:84%
Because -- but a lot
of times these --

00:21:26.919 --> 00:21:28.955 align:middle line:84%
the artists that are
doing it, they're doing it

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:32.258 align:middle line:84%
because they're either being
coached by their record company

00:21:32.258 --> 00:21:36.262 align:middle line:84%
or their A and R person, or
they're looking at the game

00:21:36.262 --> 00:21:38.564 align:middle line:84%
from another perspective
that's saying, oh, well,

00:21:38.564 --> 00:21:41.234 align:middle line:84%
this guy did this particular
record and it worked,

00:21:41.234 --> 00:21:43.336 align:middle line:84%
and so I'm going to
follow in that suit.

00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:46.506 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of -- it's a lot
of monkey-see-monkey-do,

00:21:46.506 --> 00:21:50.576 align:middle line:84%
if I may use that phrase,
in the business as well.

00:21:50.576 --> 00:21:54.046 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if you -- if
you poll and sit down with a lot

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:56.849 align:middle line:84%
of the artists that
are making the records,

00:21:56.849 --> 00:22:00.186 align:middle line:84%
that's not a general
consumption of how they feel --

00:22:00.186 --> 00:22:02.622 align:middle line:84%
conception, I should
say, of how they feel.

00:22:02.622 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.859 align:middle line:84%
>> And they -- they -- they're
more intelligent than that.

00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:11.197 align:middle line:84%
They have -- they have levels of
complexity and dimension to them

00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
that they're not able to
express because of they're

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
in this tight box, they have
to be this certain type of --

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.708 align:middle line:84%
project this image of
this artist that they may

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:25.178 align:middle line:84%
or may not necessarily
agree with.

00:22:25.178 --> 00:22:26.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was kind of
a degenerative cycle,

00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:29.348 align:middle line:84%
but the same thing was
happening outside in the world

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:84%
of what now has become
reality television.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it just became coarse.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.689 align:middle line:90%
Communications and entertainment

00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:39.058 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds started
becoming demeaning

00:22:39.058 --> 00:22:40.493 align:middle line:90%
and coarse across the board.

00:22:40.493 --> 00:22:43.529 align:middle line:84%
So why would rap be
exempt from that trend?

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:45.531 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course is going
to show up there, too.

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:48.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you go back
into the early '70s records,

00:22:48.801 --> 00:22:50.603 align:middle line:90%
everything was about upliftment.

00:22:50.603 --> 00:22:51.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And then right at the
end, I should say more

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.809 align:middle line:90%
like the beginning -- be mid-90s

00:22:56.809 --> 00:22:59.145 align:middle line:84%
that frequency started
to change.

00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:00.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Going downward.

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:00.646 align:middle line:90%
Downward spiral --

00:23:00.646 --> 00:23:01.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:23:01.414 --> 00:23:02.448 align:middle line:90%
>> -- and we're in it.

00:23:02.448 --> 00:23:03.749 align:middle line:84%
>> And it started
to get away from --

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:06.652 align:middle line:84%
get away from harmony and
got away into more discord,

00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:09.388 align:middle line:84%
even to the point where
[inaudible] started to come

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:12.291 align:middle line:84%
into the game, and that's
all part of what I consider

00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:17.163 align:middle line:84%
to be a whole other plan to keep
everybody in the state of fear,

00:23:17.163 --> 00:23:20.333 align:middle line:84%
to keep everybody in
the state of being

00:23:20.333 --> 00:23:22.001 align:middle line:84%
against each other
or against odds.

00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:25.104 align:middle line:84%
That's what this whole
thing about, you know,

00:23:25.104 --> 00:23:28.174 align:middle line:84%
this whole psychic war on
terror and everything else,

00:23:28.174 --> 00:23:30.943 align:middle line:84%
or see something, say
something, you know.

00:23:30.943 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:84%
This is -- this is all part
of, to me, a bigger plan

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:84%
to make us all inherently
afraid of everything --

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:38.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:40.753 align:middle line:84%
>> -- so that we do
not understand or get

00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:44.757 align:middle line:84%
into our full potential,
which is our connection

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:45.958 align:middle line:90%
that we have to each other.

00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:47.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:23:47.193 --> 00:23:49.529 align:middle line:84%
And then the black community
had another challenge

00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:50.796 align:middle line:90%
that it had to go through.

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:53.232 align:middle line:84%
And in my work I do all kinds
of interviews, you know,

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.401 align:middle line:84%
and you can call some of them
conspiracy, although most

00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.737 align:middle line:84%
of them are not conspiracies,
they're realities.

00:23:57.737 --> 00:23:59.906 align:middle line:90%
And one of the realities is

00:23:59.906 --> 00:24:03.509 align:middle line:84%
that from the Vietnam War
there was a lot of drugs --

00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:05.912 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of drugs that
were taken out of Vietnam.

00:24:05.912 --> 00:24:08.514 align:middle line:84%
That was kind of the black
ops industry's cash cattle.

00:24:08.514 --> 00:24:11.584 align:middle line:84%
And they were distributed
to the inner-city youth.

00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:15.621 align:middle line:84%
And this created just
a horrendous impact

00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:18.324 align:middle line:84%
on the black inner-city
youth in particular.

00:24:18.324 --> 00:24:19.725 align:middle line:90%
What -- how do you see that --

00:24:19.725 --> 00:24:22.361 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what was going
on from your perspective?

00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:24.363 align:middle line:84%
What did it do to
your neighborhoods?

00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:25.398 align:middle line:90%
to your families?

00:24:25.398 --> 00:24:27.166 align:middle line:90%
>> It decimated it.

00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:31.537 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking about
my older cousins, my older --

00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:38.244 align:middle line:84%
my uncles, and they were strung
out on heroin, a lot of them,

00:24:38.244 --> 00:24:42.181 align:middle line:84%
and so it killed a big
chunk of our community.

00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:44.350 align:middle line:90%
A lot of the -- our leaders,

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.754 align:middle line:84%
a lot of our revolutionary
partners that was out there,

00:24:48.754 --> 00:24:52.458 align:middle line:84%
whether it be the Black
Panther Party or any

00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:56.662 align:middle line:84%
of these organizations that were
about upliftment of black youth

00:24:56.662 --> 00:25:00.633 align:middle line:84%
at the time, all have been
decimated, either put in jails

00:25:00.633 --> 00:25:02.468 align:middle line:84%
or they're in the jail
-- or they're in graves.

00:25:02.468 --> 00:25:06.205 align:middle line:84%
And the drugs was
a big part of it.

00:25:06.205 --> 00:25:08.541 align:middle line:84%
And we're still fighting
the drugs, you know.

00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:09.508 align:middle line:90%
It just moves --

00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:10.476 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not like
it's not happening.

00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:11.811 align:middle line:90%
It's still happening.

00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:14.313 align:middle line:84%
It's a cash cow for
the black ops.

00:25:14.313 --> 00:25:15.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. And it moves --

00:25:15.715 --> 00:25:20.286 align:middle line:84%
and it moves from heroin from
the '70s to crack in the '80s.

00:25:20.286 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And at the time when we
was producing Public Enemy,

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.259 align:middle line:84%
crack was destroying
our communities.

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:31.263 align:middle line:84%
And crack was something that
was ridiculously dangerous.

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:34.266 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every -- it was
almost to the point where one

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:39.338 align:middle line:84%
in every household had
a relative or someone

00:25:39.338 --> 00:25:42.308 align:middle line:84%
in the household that
was strung out on crack.

00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:45.344 align:middle line:84%
And so when you -- and when you
think about what it did for --

00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:48.214 align:middle line:84%
what it does for
you, it makes you --

00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:51.017 align:middle line:84%
it makes you almost
comatose in a way.

00:25:51.017 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So now all you want to do is get
that next high, that next fix,

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.956 align:middle line:84%
so now you get people that
are breaking in houses.

00:25:56.956 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:84%
You got families that are
breaking up because the sister

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.929 align:middle line:90%
or brother is strung out on it.

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:05.131 align:middle line:90%
>> The jails are filling up.

00:26:05.131 --> 00:26:06.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:10.603 align:middle line:84%
So -- so -- so our
communities are becoming --

00:26:10.603 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:84%
are becoming like these
battlegrounds as opposed

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.876 align:middle line:90%
to it being a community.

00:26:16.876 --> 00:26:19.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And it just
seemed to me that there's --

00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:22.581 align:middle line:84%
the targeting -- it was really
a targeting that occurred.

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:24.483 align:middle line:84%
And you can say it
was all about profit,

00:26:24.483 --> 00:26:27.386 align:middle line:84%
but I think there was
another fear factor behind it:

00:26:27.386 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:90%
To shut the black youth up.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.457 align:middle line:90%
Dull them down.

00:26:31.457 --> 00:26:32.825 align:middle line:90%
Get them out of the way.

00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:34.193 align:middle line:90%
What were they so afraid of?

00:26:34.193 --> 00:26:36.629 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion.

00:26:36.629 --> 00:26:40.099 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure what
they were afraid of,

00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:42.268 align:middle line:84%
but I think that it
was part of a plan

00:26:42.268 --> 00:26:44.737 align:middle line:90%
to just keep everybody down.

00:26:44.737 --> 00:26:46.405 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to
understand something.

00:26:46.405 --> 00:26:48.374 align:middle line:90%
The black community doesn't live

00:26:48.374 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in a community isolated
to itself.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
The black -- you know, the
black community is a subset

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.048 align:middle line:90%
of a wider community.

00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:59.185 align:middle line:84%
And whatever goes on in the
black community, eventually goes

00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:90%
on in the wider community.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.423 align:middle line:84%
So if you -- it's almost like if
you want to say it's targeted,

00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:06.826 align:middle line:84%
it's targeted because
if it starts there,

00:27:06.826 --> 00:27:08.627 align:middle line:84%
it's going to end
up somewhere else.

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:10.229 align:middle line:84%
And so -- you know,
so where do you do?

00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:12.965 align:middle line:84%
You hit -- you hit the what is
known as the "target market"

00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:16.102 align:middle line:84%
so that you can -- so that it'll
eventually see the wider market.

00:27:16.102 --> 00:27:18.437 align:middle line:84%
Because now you got white
kids coming into the hood --

00:27:18.437 --> 00:27:19.105 align:middle line:90%
>> You bet.

00:27:19.105 --> 00:27:20.106 align:middle line:90%
>> -- buying crack.

00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
You got, you know
-- you got the --

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.377 align:middle line:84%
you know, you have the
Latino kids buying it.

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:27.747 align:middle line:84%
You know, so when you
think about it now,

00:27:27.747 --> 00:27:31.817 align:middle line:84%
you're destroying not only
just the black communities,

00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:35.488 align:middle line:84%
but you're destroying the
mainstream communities as well.

00:27:35.488 --> 00:27:38.891 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a unfortunate
situation

00:27:38.891 --> 00:27:40.526 align:middle line:90%
>> It's terrible.

00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:43.062 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd like
to do now is go back --

00:27:43.062 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:90%
I just talked about the '60s.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.465 align:middle line:84%
We know that that kind of
nefarious thing was going

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:50.069 align:middle line:84%
on starting in the '60s,
flooding the communities.

00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:53.839 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at how the social
messages were changing in music.

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:56.942 align:middle line:84%
If you're just kind of indulge
me a little bit and give us kind

00:27:56.942 --> 00:27:59.645 align:middle line:84%
of like a thumbnail sketch
of what was happening

00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:03.416 align:middle line:84%
with black music and the
messages from the '60s.

00:28:03.416 --> 00:28:05.618 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the messages were
simple: It was about love.

00:28:05.618 --> 00:28:08.621 align:middle line:84%
It was about getting
your act together.

00:28:08.621 --> 00:28:11.157 align:middle line:84%
It was about talking
about some of the issues

00:28:11.157 --> 00:28:15.661 align:middle line:84%
of whether it be alcoholism that
was out there, or whether it be,

00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:19.598 align:middle line:84%
you know, drugs in
the community.

00:28:19.598 --> 00:28:23.068 align:middle line:84%
It was about -- it was
about upliftment, you know,

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:27.907 align:middle line:84%
and everything was about
-- was positive and upbeat.

00:28:27.907 --> 00:28:29.308 align:middle line:84%
>> It was trying to
kind of reach out

00:28:29.308 --> 00:28:31.544 align:middle line:84%
and give a helping hand
if someone was down

00:28:31.544 --> 00:28:32.978 align:middle line:90%
or struggling or whatnot.

00:28:32.978 --> 00:28:33.412 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:33.412 --> 00:28:34.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:34.547 --> 00:28:38.217 align:middle line:84%
>> And -- and so -- and
it was also unifying.

00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:40.386 align:middle line:90%
It had a unifying message.

00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:44.757 align:middle line:84%
And the message was -- you know,
for me, the message was simple.

00:28:44.757 --> 00:28:46.492 align:middle line:90%
It was like -- it was like,

00:28:46.492 --> 00:28:49.228 align:middle line:84%
to get to your higher
consciousness,

00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:51.497 align:middle line:84%
understand what's
going on around you,

00:28:51.497 --> 00:28:54.967 align:middle line:84%
help uplift the community
that you have

00:28:54.967 --> 00:28:57.703 align:middle line:90%
around you, teach the youth.

00:28:57.703 --> 00:28:59.705 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was
all about, you know,

00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:03.509 align:middle line:84%
about how to make your community
and your situation better.

00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:05.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Which were a couple of
the top artists you would say

00:29:05.711 --> 00:29:08.180 align:middle line:84%
that were really conveying
those messages well in the '60s?

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:13.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you're talking --
whether it be Marvin Gaye or --

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:13.919 align:middle line:90%
>> James Brown.

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:14.987 align:middle line:90%
>> James Brown.

00:29:14.987 --> 00:29:17.223 align:middle line:84%
I mean -- I mean,
pretty much every artist

00:29:17.223 --> 00:29:18.924 align:middle line:84%
that you can think of,
you know, whether --

00:29:18.924 --> 00:29:21.927 align:middle line:84%
you know, was Cool and
the Gang, or the --

00:29:21.927 --> 00:29:25.898 align:middle line:84%
you know, every artist that
you can think of were all

00:29:25.898 --> 00:29:28.934 align:middle line:84%
about doing something that was
positive for the community,

00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:30.903 align:middle line:84%
because they all came
from the community.

00:29:30.903 --> 00:29:33.038 align:middle line:84%
>> And most of it was
really feel-good music.

00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:33.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, we all loved it.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.675 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it even found
their way to the Top 40.

00:29:36.675 --> 00:29:37.209 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckling]

00:29:37.209 --> 00:29:38.577 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:38.577 --> 00:29:40.713 align:middle line:84%
And made some money, which was
[inaudible] which was nice.

00:29:40.713 --> 00:29:42.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And so now we
going into the '70s.

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:43.449 align:middle line:90%
We have the Vietnam War.

00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:45.117 align:middle line:90%
You just mentioned Marvin Gaye,

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:48.087 align:middle line:84%
and this one particular song I
think that everyone that listens

00:29:48.087 --> 00:29:51.857 align:middle line:84%
to this will remember and
was beloved to all of us.

00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:55.527 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at what
Marvin Gaye was doing, 1971.

00:29:55.527 --> 00:30:04.303 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:30:04.303 --> 00:30:13.379 align:middle line:84%
Mother, mother, there's
too many of you crying.

00:30:14.146 --> 00:30:16.615 align:middle line:90%
Brother, brother, brother,

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:23.155 align:middle line:84%
there's far too many
of you dying.

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:32.298 align:middle line:84%
You know we've got to find a way
to bring some lovin' here today.

00:30:32.298 --> 00:30:39.738 align:middle line:84%
Father, father, We
don't need to escalate.

00:30:39.738 --> 00:30:48.013 align:middle line:84%
War is not the answer, for
only love can conquer hate.

00:30:49.148 --> 00:30:57.389 align:middle line:90%
You know we've got to find a way

00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:59.625 align:middle line:84%
to bring some understandin'
here today.

00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Picket lines and --

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.861 align:middle line:90%
Who doesn't love that one?

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.129 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great.

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:05.431 align:middle line:84%
>> And, I mean, it
breaks your heart, too,

00:31:05.431 --> 00:31:08.267 align:middle line:84%
because it's been done so
sweetly and so sensitively,

00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:10.569 align:middle line:90%
almost like a heart crying out.

00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:11.337 align:middle line:90%
We don't need that.

00:31:11.337 --> 00:31:12.638 align:middle line:90%
We don't need the war.

00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to be doing
this to each other anymore.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.375 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the Vietnam War.

00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:18.344 align:middle line:84%
You had personal
experiences in your family.

00:31:18.344 --> 00:31:20.913 align:middle line:84%
What was going on in your life
and what you were learning.

00:31:20.913 --> 00:31:24.049 align:middle line:84%
I think you had a cousin
that returned from the war.

00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:25.818 align:middle line:84%
What were you learning
about what was happening

00:31:25.818 --> 00:31:28.387 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the world
and how is that reflected back

00:31:28.387 --> 00:31:29.822 align:middle line:90%
in music during that era?

00:31:29.822 --> 00:31:31.757 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it was
an amazing time

00:31:31.757 --> 00:31:34.226 align:middle line:84%
because when my cousin
would come back,

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.695 align:middle line:84%
he would tell me stories that,
you know -- because, once again,

00:31:36.695 --> 00:31:42.001 align:middle line:84%
he was a mechanic in the Air
Force, and so he was also

00:31:42.001 --> 00:31:45.204 align:middle line:84%
in charge of bringing off
the bodies, and, you know,

00:31:45.204 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:84%
he tells me, like, you
know, every day, like,

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.111 align:middle line:84%
he's shipping home
bodies of kids

00:31:52.111 --> 00:31:55.314 align:middle line:84%
that were basically
killed in war.

00:31:55.314 --> 00:31:58.684 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even
understand how --

00:31:58.684 --> 00:32:01.153 align:middle line:84%
what that means until
if you -- if you --

00:32:01.153 --> 00:32:03.555 align:middle line:84%
in the time when I was coming
up, you know, you're talking

00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:05.591 align:middle line:84%
about there was a
draft, you know.

00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:09.028 align:middle line:84%
At the minute that a kid
turned 18, you had to,

00:32:09.028 --> 00:32:09.962 align:middle line:90%
you know, sign up for the --

00:32:09.962 --> 00:32:11.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Put your name
into the lottery.

00:32:11.063 --> 00:32:12.031 align:middle line:84%
>> -- draft, and you
could be -- exactly --

00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:13.999 align:middle line:84%
and you could be
shipped off to war.

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:16.101 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is,
they'll give you, what,

00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:19.038 align:middle line:84%
six weeks basic training
and then throw you

00:32:19.038 --> 00:32:23.175 align:middle line:84%
in a war situation, and
then you have to figure out

00:32:23.175 --> 00:32:25.444 align:middle line:90%
and try to survive that.

00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:26.979 align:middle line:90%
And you're talking about kids

00:32:26.979 --> 00:32:29.515 align:middle line:84%
that never knew anything
about that.

00:32:29.515 --> 00:32:33.986 align:middle line:84%
You know, they lived a normal
lifestyle of just, you know,

00:32:33.986 --> 00:32:37.423 align:middle line:84%
playing baseball or football
or whatever the case may be.

00:32:37.423 --> 00:32:39.858 align:middle line:84%
Now they're carrying a
gun and they're having

00:32:39.858 --> 00:32:42.895 align:middle line:90%
to go kill and -- to stay alive.

00:32:42.895 --> 00:32:46.799 align:middle line:84%
That was something that not
many people can deal with.

00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:49.802 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, when
he was coming back,

00:32:49.802 --> 00:32:53.705 align:middle line:84%
he was telling me these things,
kind of like, it resonated to me

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:56.875 align:middle line:84%
so big because, you know,
I could've been gone.

00:32:56.875 --> 00:32:59.278 align:middle line:84%
But it just so happened
that I, you know,

00:32:59.278 --> 00:33:01.346 align:middle line:84%
we had escaped the
draft had ended

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:03.916 align:middle line:84%
at the time before
I was able to,

00:33:03.916 --> 00:33:05.818 align:middle line:90%
you know, be eligible for it.

00:33:05.818 --> 00:33:09.054 align:middle line:90%
And so what it did was it --

00:33:09.054 --> 00:33:12.925 align:middle line:84%
the music that he
brought back reflected it.

00:33:12.925 --> 00:33:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of music
was he bringing back?

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, anything from the
Funkadelics, you know, to,

00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:19.665 align:middle line:84%
you know, Parliament
Funkadelic was his favorite.

00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:22.034 align:middle line:90%
That created an escape for him.

00:33:22.034 --> 00:33:23.735 align:middle line:84%
You know, of course,
James Brown;

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:24.937 align:middle line:90%
of course, Wilson Pickett.

00:33:24.937 --> 00:33:27.606 align:middle line:84%
You know, you think about
Earth, Wind, and Fire.

00:33:27.606 --> 00:33:30.175 align:middle line:84%
You think about -- I mean, you
think about a lot of the groups

00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:32.177 align:middle line:84%
that -- you think
about Bob Marley,

00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:84%
you think about Peter Tosh,
you think all these groups

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.682 align:middle line:90%
that he brought back that --

00:33:36.682 --> 00:33:40.986 align:middle line:84%
and it was all different
genres of music.

00:33:40.986 --> 00:33:45.491 align:middle line:84%
And -- and bringing it back, but
they all had a central message,

00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:47.226 align:middle line:84%
whether it was Sly
and the Family Stone,

00:33:47.226 --> 00:33:50.529 align:middle line:84%
or whether it was Jimi Hendrix,
they all had a central message,

00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and the message that
they was talking

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.899 align:middle line:84%
about was basically,
no more war.

00:33:53.899 --> 00:33:54.933 align:middle line:90%
We want peace.

00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:56.401 align:middle line:84%
We want to build
our communities.

00:33:56.401 --> 00:33:57.369 align:middle line:90%
We want love.

00:33:57.369 --> 00:33:59.938 align:middle line:90%
We want understanding.

00:33:59.938 --> 00:34:02.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there any difference,
during the Vietnam War

00:34:02.508 --> 00:34:04.810 align:middle line:84%
in particular, when you
had some much strife,

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.512 align:middle line:90%
so many troubles already,

00:34:06.512 --> 00:34:09.780 align:middle line:84%
you had the drug problems
had started by that time?

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.618 align:middle line:84%
Was there any difference
within the inner cities

00:34:12.618 --> 00:34:15.220 align:middle line:84%
with people being asked to
go fight for this country

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:18.923 align:middle line:84%
than would you guess there was
anywhere else in the country?

00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:20.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, nobody wanted
to fight, you know.

00:34:20.926 --> 00:34:25.097 align:middle line:84%
But you got to keep in mind that
you're put into that situation,

00:34:25.097 --> 00:34:26.932 align:middle line:84%
and once you're put in
that situation, well,

00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:28.734 align:middle line:90%
then, you have to respond.

00:34:28.734 --> 00:34:30.401 align:middle line:90%
And I think that, you know,

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.504 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people responded
different ways.

00:34:32.504 --> 00:34:35.707 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of people
that was dodging, that would,

00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:37.943 align:middle line:84%
you know, escape to
Canada, you know.

00:34:37.943 --> 00:34:40.579 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
dealt with it.

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:43.481 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the musicians
that came out that --

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:46.685 align:middle line:84%
they dealt with it
by singing about it,

00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:48.754 align:middle line:84%
by raising the consciousness
about it.

00:34:48.754 --> 00:34:52.057 align:middle line:84%
And I think that by them raising
the consciousness about it,

00:34:52.057 --> 00:34:57.129 align:middle line:84%
created a sentiment and a tone
that allowed even for the people

00:34:57.129 --> 00:34:59.565 align:middle line:84%
to understand what was
going on in Vietnam,

00:34:59.565 --> 00:35:02.367 align:middle line:84%
because if you understand
back in -- back in that time,

00:35:02.367 --> 00:35:05.838 align:middle line:84%
we were isolated from
news and information

00:35:05.838 --> 00:35:08.407 align:middle line:84%
about what was actually
going on over there.

00:35:08.407 --> 00:35:11.743 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't for the artists
that was singing about this,

00:35:11.743 --> 00:35:14.346 align:middle line:90%
gave -- gave -- gave back --

00:35:14.346 --> 00:35:17.683 align:middle line:84%
gave the community
something to look for now.

00:35:17.683 --> 00:35:21.286 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden, journalists
started asking questions.

00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:23.722 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden, we starting
to find out want to find

00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:27.926 align:middle line:84%
out more about what is this
war in Vietnam, because a lot

00:35:27.926 --> 00:35:30.829 align:middle line:84%
of people didn't even know it
was a war that was going on.

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:33.398 align:middle line:84%
We just knew that we was
fighting some war over there.

00:35:33.398 --> 00:35:35.968 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew what it was
about, what it was for,

00:35:35.968 --> 00:35:39.605 align:middle line:84%
and so it was the
consciousness of these artists

00:35:39.605 --> 00:35:43.375 align:middle line:84%
that raised the consciousness
of everyone else that became --

00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.545 align:middle line:84%
that became, you know, fighters
and started to, you know,

00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:48.614 align:middle line:84%
antiwar movements
and different things,

00:35:48.614 --> 00:35:51.483 align:middle line:84%
and that's what in
turn ended that --

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> That was very powerful music
that came out at that time.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.656 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, since then,
what they were talking about at

00:35:57.656 --> 00:36:00.993 align:middle line:84%
that time has since been
validated because, you know,

00:36:00.993 --> 00:36:03.929 align:middle line:84%
declassified documents
and so forth have shown us

00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:06.298 align:middle line:84%
that the war was primarily
something, you know,

00:36:06.298 --> 00:36:09.101 align:middle line:84%
a figment of Kissinger's
imagination, you know,

00:36:09.101 --> 00:36:11.603 align:middle line:84%
and the players for
various reasons having to do

00:36:11.603 --> 00:36:12.838 align:middle line:90%
with resources and so forth.

00:36:12.838 --> 00:36:14.473 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a little
legitimate war to begin

00:36:14.473 --> 00:36:16.241 align:middle line:84%
with that we should have
been involved in anyway.

00:36:16.241 --> 00:36:17.876 align:middle line:90%
And these guys must've --

00:36:17.876 --> 00:36:20.746 align:middle line:84%
you can't be on the ground
in that kind of field

00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:22.581 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness and not see

00:36:22.581 --> 00:36:24.950 align:middle line:84%
or feel something's
wrong with this picture.

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Why am I killing these
people, these women and kids?

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.554 align:middle line:90%
You know, so that had --

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:32.090 align:middle line:84%
the music did a really
beautiful job, I think,

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:34.593 align:middle line:84%
of bringing that kind
consciousness of the surface.

00:36:34.593 --> 00:36:35.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it did.

00:36:35.427 --> 00:36:36.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. So that was the '70s.

00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:40.966 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Now we're hitting it into
the '80s, and you come along,

00:36:40.966 --> 00:36:43.669 align:middle line:84%
Public Enemy comes along toward
the latter part of the '80s.

00:36:43.669 --> 00:36:45.971 align:middle line:84%
But what was happening
in the early '80s

00:36:45.971 --> 00:36:48.407 align:middle line:84%
in the consciousness
of what was going on?

00:36:48.407 --> 00:36:50.976 align:middle line:84%
>> The consciousness was
back then was all about,

00:36:50.976 --> 00:36:55.113 align:middle line:84%
I want to get accepted
into the wider society.

00:36:55.113 --> 00:36:57.649 align:middle line:90%
I want to be affluent now.

00:36:57.649 --> 00:37:01.987 align:middle line:84%
Now money is and
became the key thing.

00:37:01.987 --> 00:37:03.855 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to go to
the clubs when --

00:37:03.855 --> 00:37:07.025 align:middle line:84%
you talking about the disco
era, now it becomes, you know,

00:37:07.025 --> 00:37:09.461 align:middle line:90%
it's red -- it's red carpet.

00:37:09.461 --> 00:37:11.496 align:middle line:90%
It's velvet rope.

00:37:11.496 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
It's all like --
it's all exclusive.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.169 align:middle line:84%
It's all I want to be
seen and I want to be --

00:37:17.169 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and I want to wear
the best clothes,

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.038 align:middle line:90%
and I just want to go out.

00:37:20.038 --> 00:37:22.674 align:middle line:84%
I want to forget
about the struggle.

00:37:22.674 --> 00:37:25.377 align:middle line:84%
I want to forget about
anything that's conscious.

00:37:25.377 --> 00:37:27.713 align:middle line:84%
I want to -- I want to --
I want to sit over here

00:37:27.713 --> 00:37:30.282 align:middle line:84%
and sniff cocaine
and just chill out --

00:37:30.282 --> 00:37:31.717 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to have my
place at the table

00:37:31.717 --> 00:37:32.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:37:32.818 --> 00:37:35.053 align:middle line:84%
And so now -- so now
when you think about it,

00:37:35.053 --> 00:37:36.188 align:middle line:90%
that that brought on --

00:37:36.188 --> 00:37:39.458 align:middle line:84%
that's what the whole
disco era was all about.

00:37:39.458 --> 00:37:44.162 align:middle line:84%
And, you know -- you know,
me watching this from afar,

00:37:44.162 --> 00:37:46.098 align:middle line:84%
was saying like,
well, wait a minute.

00:37:46.098 --> 00:37:48.567 align:middle line:84%
They're still wrong and
things that are happening

00:37:48.567 --> 00:37:51.269 align:middle line:84%
in the community that
no one's addressing.

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:56.007 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I was
at college and I was in --

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:59.444 align:middle line:84%
on campus, and there
was a woman that was --

00:37:59.444 --> 00:38:04.216 align:middle line:84%
a girl at the time I was there,
and she was selling a red,

00:38:04.216 --> 00:38:09.955 align:middle line:84%
black, and green button that
said, "Save the Children."

00:38:09.955 --> 00:38:13.792 align:middle line:84%
And she was just asking for
maybe a dollar for the button.

00:38:13.792 --> 00:38:17.863 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was walking by
her like she didn't exist.

00:38:17.863 --> 00:38:19.664 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking
at her like -- like --

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:23.435 align:middle line:84%
like, why is she talking
about save the children?

00:38:23.435 --> 00:38:26.405 align:middle line:84%
and what's this red, black,
and green thing, you know?

00:38:26.405 --> 00:38:29.508 align:middle line:84%
And the red, black, and green
represented the black --

00:38:29.508 --> 00:38:34.179 align:middle line:84%
it was like our own black
national flag, you know.

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:36.181 align:middle line:90%
It was the colors

00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:39.918 align:middle line:84%
that symbolizes unity
amongst black people.

00:38:39.918 --> 00:38:43.855 align:middle line:84%
And with the save the children,
the message to me was clear:

00:38:43.855 --> 00:38:45.424 align:middle line:90%
It was about the kids.

00:38:45.424 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And for people to
be ignoring her,

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.395 align:middle line:84%
kind of like registered
something to me,

00:38:50.395 --> 00:38:51.997 align:middle line:90%
and it said, you know something.

00:38:51.997 --> 00:38:55.767 align:middle line:84%
If I could build something or do
something or if I have a voice

00:38:55.767 --> 00:38:59.271 align:middle line:84%
in something, I want to
be able to answer that.

00:38:59.271 --> 00:39:01.706 align:middle line:84%
And so thus, you know,
having the chance

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:06.044 align:middle line:84%
to produce Public Enemy gave
me a chance to answer that.

00:39:06.044 --> 00:39:07.779 align:middle line:84%
>> How did it go
when you first --

00:39:07.779 --> 00:39:11.883 align:middle line:84%
when this phenomenon first
started, how was this accepted

00:39:11.883 --> 00:39:13.718 align:middle line:84%
by the inner-city
youth to begin with?

00:39:13.718 --> 00:39:16.154 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it must've
been like manna.

00:39:16.154 --> 00:39:17.489 align:middle line:90%
>> They didn't understand it.

00:39:17.489 --> 00:39:20.592 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, we was told
everything from, you know,

00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:23.028 align:middle line:90%
conscious music will never sell.

00:39:23.028 --> 00:39:24.262 align:middle line:90%
You know, conscious --

00:39:24.262 --> 00:39:25.997 align:middle line:84%
nobody wants to hear
anything about conscious rap.

00:39:25.997 --> 00:39:28.433 align:middle line:84%
They want -- at the time, if you
noticed anything that was going

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:31.837 align:middle line:84%
on in the hip-hop community
was all about party raps.

00:39:31.837 --> 00:39:33.805 align:middle line:84%
It was all about
bragging and bolstering.

00:39:33.805 --> 00:39:35.907 align:middle line:84%
Is all about talking about
the things that you had

00:39:35.907 --> 00:39:38.677 align:middle line:84%
versus the things that
somebody else did not have.

00:39:38.677 --> 00:39:42.948 align:middle line:84%
So we came in with
this idea of how --

00:39:42.948 --> 00:39:45.417 align:middle line:84%
we could talk about
something that's relevant

00:39:45.417 --> 00:39:47.652 align:middle line:90%
to us and our community.

00:39:47.652 --> 00:39:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And we were met with, like,
no, this is not going to work.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.126 align:middle line:84%
So thus, that's why if
you notice that none

00:39:54.126 --> 00:39:56.261 align:middle line:84%
of those records were
really on the radio.

00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:57.696 align:middle line:90%
They never got into the media.

00:39:57.696 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.731 align:middle line:90%
>> They never -- the video --

00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:02.334 align:middle line:84%
we never made a video
that was acceptable on MTV

00:40:02.334 --> 00:40:04.836 align:middle line:90%
or any -- any of those outlets.

00:40:04.836 --> 00:40:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And --

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet, everyone
knows their name.

00:40:07.172 --> 00:40:11.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because -- because what
was going on in the community,

00:40:11.076 --> 00:40:15.313 align:middle line:84%
it resonated to the real core
people that was happening

00:40:15.313 --> 00:40:17.148 align:middle line:90%
on the streets in the community.

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:19.885 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, when they --
when they heard the band

00:40:19.885 --> 00:40:22.621 align:middle line:84%
and they heard the messages
and they heard the group,

00:40:22.621 --> 00:40:25.223 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to get
more involved with it.

00:40:25.223 --> 00:40:29.027 align:middle line:84%
When they saw that this was not
just a particular solo artist

00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:36.201 align:middle line:84%
but it was actually a group, a
network of guys getting together

00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:39.104 align:middle line:84%
that necessarily not every
one of them was a rapper,

00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:41.940 align:middle line:84%
not all of them was a DJ,
not all of them were --

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.209 align:middle line:84%
you know, they were
-- you had security

00:40:44.209 --> 00:40:45.710 align:middle line:84%
of the first [inaudible],
which was --

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:49.014 align:middle line:84%
which was basically their homies
or their posse, if you would.

00:40:49.014 --> 00:40:52.617 align:middle line:84%
So you saw this kind of
like military, you know,

00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:56.288 align:middle line:84%
black national front
that was coming at you.

00:40:56.288 --> 00:40:57.622 align:middle line:90%
And it was like -- it was --

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:01.293 align:middle line:84%
it was a bit much to kind
of digest, but once the --

00:41:01.293 --> 00:41:03.962 align:middle line:84%
once the kids knew what
it was all about --

00:41:03.962 --> 00:41:05.096 align:middle line:90%
>> You did it for the kids.

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:06.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:41:06.298 --> 00:41:09.167 align:middle line:84%
'Cause the kids understood
the concept of a posse.

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:11.169 align:middle line:84%
They understood the
concept of a gain.

00:41:11.169 --> 00:41:12.270 align:middle line:90%
They understood that.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.272 align:middle line:84%
They understood that
so, therefore,

00:41:14.272 --> 00:41:15.807 align:middle line:90%
they resignated [sic] to that.

00:41:15.807 --> 00:41:18.877 align:middle line:84%
They were like, wow, we
can identify with this

00:41:18.877 --> 00:41:21.413 align:middle line:84%
because this was
speaking directly to us

00:41:21.413 --> 00:41:23.114 align:middle line:90%
and not to everybody else.

00:41:23.114 --> 00:41:25.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. Yet at the
same time, you sold also

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:27.352 align:middle line:90%
in the white community.

00:41:27.352 --> 00:41:30.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because of the
rebellion that was there.

00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:33.558 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at the same
time that was happening

00:41:33.558 --> 00:41:36.194 align:middle line:84%
in the black community,
well, punk was coming

00:41:36.194 --> 00:41:37.596 align:middle line:90%
up in the white community.

00:41:37.596 --> 00:41:41.299 align:middle line:84%
And it was -- and it was a thing
-- it was the same vibration,

00:41:41.299 --> 00:41:44.269 align:middle line:84%
the system and rebelling
against it.

00:41:44.269 --> 00:41:45.604 align:middle line:84%
And so what had happened
is it just --

00:41:45.604 --> 00:41:47.138 align:middle line:84%
it just so happened
that these two --

00:41:47.138 --> 00:41:51.376 align:middle line:84%
these two kind like situations
from two different sides

00:41:51.376 --> 00:41:55.046 align:middle line:84%
of the spectrum kind like
merged and stuck together

00:41:55.046 --> 00:42:01.419 align:middle line:84%
and became this symbol of --
of -- of freedom if you would,

00:42:01.419 --> 00:42:03.822 align:middle line:84%
and music culturally
and everything else.

00:42:03.822 --> 00:42:05.757 align:middle line:84%
That's why you got --
that's why you have a group

00:42:05.757 --> 00:42:09.494 align:middle line:84%
like Anthrax do -- and
Public Enemy coming together

00:42:09.494 --> 00:42:12.297 align:middle line:84%
to create Bring the
Noise a second time

00:42:12.297 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And yesterday
before we saw you speaking

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.837 align:middle line:84%
at the LOHAS Conference, right,
here in Boulder, Colorado,

00:42:18.837 --> 00:42:20.438 align:middle line:90%
you know, you say, what?

00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:21.706 align:middle line:90%
The LOHAS?

00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:24.042 align:middle line:84%
It's like a lot of very
liberal, mostly white people,

00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:26.578 align:middle line:84%
middle-age white people, and you
are bringing a very important

00:42:26.578 --> 00:42:28.980 align:middle line:84%
message about this
transformation through music.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.449 align:middle line:84%
But before you went on, I
was sitting out in the lobby

00:42:31.449 --> 00:42:34.386 align:middle line:84%
and a man started up a
conversation with us,

00:42:34.386 --> 00:42:36.254 align:middle line:90%
about 50 years old, white guy.

00:42:36.254 --> 00:42:37.656 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, "So
what are you doing?"

00:42:37.656 --> 00:42:38.757 align:middle line:90%
I said, Well, we're here

00:42:38.757 --> 00:42:39.958 align:middle line:84%
to see Hank Shocklee
and blah, blah, blah.

00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:43.561 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Oh, man," he
said, "I was a white boy

00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:47.132 align:middle line:84%
in the suburbs in Boulder
and I loved Public Enemy."

00:42:47.132 --> 00:42:48.800 align:middle line:90%
You know, and it was, from him,

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.936 align:middle line:84%
he came from it fairly
erudite family and all of that.

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:52.971 align:middle line:90%
They were into law.

00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:55.807 align:middle line:84%
They were into protesting
against one

00:42:55.807 --> 00:42:57.342 align:middle line:90%
of the nuclear plants here.

00:42:57.342 --> 00:43:00.345 align:middle line:84%
And so I was looking at
him, and he said, "Yeah,

00:43:00.345 --> 00:43:02.147 align:middle line:84%
that's the music
that spoke to me."

00:43:02.147 --> 00:43:04.115 align:middle line:84%
And so that must've
been the case.

00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:06.017 align:middle line:84%
>> Because at the time
it was the only --

00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:09.187 align:middle line:84%
it was the only music
that was speaking

00:43:09.187 --> 00:43:11.156 align:middle line:90%
for some sort of change.

00:43:11.156 --> 00:43:14.826 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it,
you know, and the reasons why

00:43:14.826 --> 00:43:19.097 align:middle line:84%
that I'm happy to be -- glad
to be at the LOHAS, you know,

00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:22.901 align:middle line:84%
Conference was because I see
the same things happening.

00:43:22.901 --> 00:43:26.371 align:middle line:84%
It's a revolution
that's happening.

00:43:26.371 --> 00:43:31.209 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the forefront
is affordable,

00:43:31.209 --> 00:43:37.782 align:middle line:84%
sustainable conscious health,
the whole vibration now is --

00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:42.987 align:middle line:84%
is a movement that --
that we have to undertake,

00:43:42.987 --> 00:43:47.358 align:middle line:84%
because we can't do anything
if our bodies are down.

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.962 align:middle line:84%
>> We can't -- if the -- you
know, you see what's going

00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:52.397 align:middle line:90%
on with the chemicals and the --

00:43:52.397 --> 00:43:53.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, boy.

00:43:53.098 --> 00:43:53.932 align:middle line:90%
>> -- the spraying --

00:43:53.932 --> 00:43:54.999 align:middle line:90%
>> We're going to get into it.

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:56.134 align:middle line:84%
>> -- and all that
stuff that's going on.

00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:59.771 align:middle line:84%
But it -- but as us, as
people, we have to --

00:43:59.771 --> 00:44:02.774 align:middle line:84%
we have to be conscious now,
and what that means is we have

00:44:02.774 --> 00:44:04.542 align:middle line:84%
to protect ourselves
in every aspect.

00:44:04.542 --> 00:44:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.178 align:middle line:90%
Okay. So three's the '80s.

00:44:07.178 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Public Enemy's on the scene.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.182 align:middle line:84%
We have the convergence of the
punk scene with the rap scene.

00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:13.485 align:middle line:90%
Now we go into the '90s.

00:44:13.485 --> 00:44:14.886 align:middle line:90%
What was happening then?

00:44:14.886 --> 00:44:16.821 align:middle line:84%
What was the consciousness you
were dealing with at the time?

00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the '90s, you
know, started to --

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.761 align:middle line:84%
started to move because
now you have to understand,

00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:24.195 align:middle line:84%
affluence is starting
to settle in.

00:44:24.195 --> 00:44:25.864 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, the one
thing that happens

00:44:25.864 --> 00:44:29.667 align:middle line:84%
with affluence comes
decadence, and with that,

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:33.138 align:middle line:84%
everybody starts now
losing the big picture.

00:44:33.138 --> 00:44:36.875 align:middle line:84%
And so what we start -- what
started happening was we started

00:44:36.875 --> 00:44:41.179 align:middle line:84%
out something that was
conscious turned it to something

00:44:41.179 --> 00:44:44.482 align:middle line:84%
that was -- that they turned
the consciousness around.

00:44:44.482 --> 00:44:49.187 align:middle line:84%
And so now it became these kinds
of beasts within each other.

00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:52.457 align:middle line:84%
You know, so now you have
groups that are talking

00:44:52.457 --> 00:44:55.427 align:middle line:84%
about black-on-black
crime and things that of

00:44:55.427 --> 00:44:56.427 align:middle line:90%
that nature, you know.

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:58.062 align:middle line:90%
Then the misogyny that comes

00:44:58.062 --> 00:45:01.466 align:middle line:84%
in with the lyrics
and everything else.

00:45:01.466 --> 00:45:04.636 align:middle line:84%
And so now what you have is
now the music is now starting

00:45:04.636 --> 00:45:06.171 align:middle line:90%
to turn on itself.

00:45:06.171 --> 00:45:09.174 align:middle line:84%
It's now starting to
implode the situation.

00:45:09.174 --> 00:45:12.143 align:middle line:84%
As more and more
success starts happening,

00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:15.447 align:middle line:90%
the more that starts to rise.

00:45:15.447 --> 00:45:18.817 align:middle line:84%
And so what you have
now is a situation

00:45:18.817 --> 00:45:22.687 align:middle line:84%
where now things have
become toxic because, yes,

00:45:22.687 --> 00:45:25.890 align:middle line:84%
there's nobody talking about
the issues that are going on,

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:27.926 align:middle line:84%
and there are more
issues happening today

00:45:27.926 --> 00:45:29.093 align:middle line:90%
than it was in the '80s.

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:30.395 align:middle line:90%
>> You bet.

00:45:30.395 --> 00:45:31.729 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at least we weren't
dealing with chemtrail's,

00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:33.231 align:middle line:90%
that we knew of at the time.

00:45:33.231 --> 00:45:36.768 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Let's move on
to 2000s up to now.

00:45:36.768 --> 00:45:40.572 align:middle line:84%
Once we hit the
turn-of-the-century to now.

00:45:40.572 --> 00:45:42.974 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know what starting
to happen now with the kids?

00:45:42.974 --> 00:45:44.609 align:middle line:90%
The kids are starting to realize

00:45:44.609 --> 00:45:46.544 align:middle line:84%
and they're taking
a double take.

00:45:46.544 --> 00:45:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful thing
about YouTube is the fact

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.217 align:middle line:84%
that now you have the
ability to go back

00:45:52.217 --> 00:45:55.386 align:middle line:90%
and watch a Marvin Gaye video

00:45:55.386 --> 00:45:57.222 align:middle line:84%
and see what he was
talking about.

00:45:57.222 --> 00:45:59.624 align:middle line:84%
You can watch a Public
Enemy video and see.

00:45:59.624 --> 00:46:04.028 align:middle line:84%
You can watch an X Clan video
or KRS One video and see,

00:46:04.028 --> 00:46:08.466 align:middle line:84%
and you can listen to -- go back
and listen to early [inaudible]

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and early Rock Kim,
and now you can start

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:15.673 align:middle line:84%
to put the pieces
together that was missing.

00:46:15.673 --> 00:46:18.776 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't this music
still relevant?

00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:21.079 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't you hearing
this music today?

00:46:21.079 --> 00:46:24.415 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't, you know,
Common just as --

00:46:24.415 --> 00:46:29.120 align:middle line:84%
just as popular as Rick
Ross is on the radio.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.224 align:middle line:84%
And now kids are starting to
understand why I do want to be

00:46:33.224 --> 00:46:35.693 align:middle line:90%
like that stuff that's there.

00:46:35.693 --> 00:46:38.696 align:middle line:84%
I want to -- I want to
vibrate on this energy

00:46:38.696 --> 00:46:41.332 align:middle line:90%
over here, this positive energy.

00:46:41.332 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if you give anybody
a choice between something

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.206 align:middle line:84%
that is negative or something
that's positive, they're going

00:46:48.206 --> 00:46:49.741 align:middle line:90%
to pick the positive anyway.

00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:51.409 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you've
noticed that there's

00:46:51.409 --> 00:46:54.245 align:middle line:84%
so much negative
that's been projected.

00:46:54.245 --> 00:46:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So the kids now are starting to
revert back into do something

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:00.919 align:middle line:84%
that -- they're going back
to their natural state.

00:47:00.919 --> 00:47:03.922 align:middle line:84%
They're going like, you know, I
want to vibrate on this music.

00:47:03.922 --> 00:47:07.425 align:middle line:84%
So now you're seeing a whole new
set of artists that are coming

00:47:07.425 --> 00:47:09.928 align:middle line:90%
up that are doing their side

00:47:09.928 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and creating a movement
within themselves.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Who do you think are some

00:47:13.598 --> 00:47:16.401 align:middle line:84%
of the really good voices
out there right now?

00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:17.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, man.

00:47:17.035 --> 00:47:18.236 align:middle line:90%
Tons of them, man.

00:47:18.236 --> 00:47:20.905 align:middle line:90%
Whether it be Amon Tobin,

00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:24.542 align:middle line:84%
who's a composer that's doing
some great things; you know,

00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:30.615 align:middle line:84%
Mala from Digital Mystikz is
doing some incredible things.

00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:33.051 align:middle line:84%
You have -- I mean, you
still got like groups

00:47:33.051 --> 00:47:35.019 align:middle line:90%
like that's a little bit older,

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:37.455 align:middle line:84%
the Dave Matthews Band
that's doing some really,

00:47:37.455 --> 00:47:38.856 align:middle line:90%
really great things.

00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a lot of groups
-- that Jason Mraz is doing --

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:42.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, wonderful.

00:47:42.794 --> 00:47:43.494 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:43.494 --> 00:47:44.529 align:middle line:90%
>> -- some great things.

00:47:44.529 --> 00:47:46.497 align:middle line:84%
You have groups that
are out there now

00:47:46.497 --> 00:47:48.533 align:middle line:90%
that are I think are important.

00:47:48.533 --> 00:47:50.768 align:middle line:84%
And people is still
starting to understand --

00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:53.071 align:middle line:84%
they're starting to
understand their importance.

00:47:53.071 --> 00:47:56.374 align:middle line:84%
And so now they're starting to
do things like Alicia Keys going

00:47:56.374 --> 00:47:59.877 align:middle line:84%
to Africa and doing
some great things there.

00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:01.279 align:middle line:90%
You know, so you starting --

00:48:01.279 --> 00:48:03.848 align:middle line:84%
you starting to see that there's
things that's starting to happen

00:48:03.848 --> 00:48:05.516 align:middle line:90%
because people are tired

00:48:05.516 --> 00:48:10.254 align:middle line:84%
of watching this movie just
become self-destructive.

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:11.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:48:11.623 --> 00:48:13.925 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that I'm noticing
is even in shows like this,

00:48:13.925 --> 00:48:16.361 align:middle line:84%
you know, the ones I do,
oftentimes I've thought,

00:48:16.361 --> 00:48:18.096 align:middle line:84%
how do I integrate
art into this?

00:48:18.096 --> 00:48:20.231 align:middle line:84%
I mean, art is coming
from the heart.

00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.833 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is
sitting and chatting,

00:48:21.833 --> 00:48:23.368 align:middle line:84%
and even though the
heart's involved,

00:48:23.368 --> 00:48:25.236 align:middle line:84%
it's often very much
intellectual.

00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:29.040 align:middle line:84%
We're taking concepts via an
interview format for example.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:33.578 align:middle line:84%
But it's starting to occur to me
that art is going to be the lens

00:48:33.578 --> 00:48:35.446 align:middle line:84%
through which we start
elevating ourselves again.

00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:37.648 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, visual arts,
all the -- all the arts.

00:48:37.648 --> 00:48:38.816 align:middle line:90%
>> It always has been.

00:48:38.816 --> 00:48:39.951 align:middle line:90%
>> It has.

00:48:39.951 --> 00:48:42.854 align:middle line:84%
But to do it not like
an MTV way of doing it.

00:48:42.854 --> 00:48:47.525 align:middle line:84%
It has to be integrated into
society and media mechanisms

00:48:47.525 --> 00:48:51.095 align:middle line:84%
in a different way than it has
so that it's coming back to all

00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:52.997 align:middle line:84%
of us now, not just
by choice of music.

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:54.298 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I get exactly
what you're saying.

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.703 align:middle line:84%
And I think that for
me, you know, art is --

00:48:58.703 --> 00:49:00.938 align:middle line:84%
there's good are
and there's bad art.

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:03.608 align:middle line:90%
To me, what's bad art is art

00:49:03.608 --> 00:49:07.979 align:middle line:84%
that does not vibrate
to your -- to you.

00:49:07.979 --> 00:49:10.815 align:middle line:84%
What it does is,
it disorients --

00:49:10.815 --> 00:49:14.018 align:middle line:90%
it disconnects you from reality.

00:49:14.018 --> 00:49:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Great art connects you.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:20.491 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what's
needed today is more avenues

00:49:20.491 --> 00:49:25.229 align:middle line:84%
for artists that are
making great art to have --

00:49:25.229 --> 00:49:26.964 align:middle line:90%
>> More platforms.

00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:28.332 align:middle line:90%
>> -- platforms [inaudible].

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:29.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:31.369 align:middle line:84%
That's not just isolated
to music fans.

00:49:31.369 --> 00:49:32.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:32.737 --> 00:49:34.806 align:middle line:84%
>> It has to start crossing over
into culture at large again.

00:49:34.806 --> 00:49:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody's into music.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.409 align:middle line:90%
Music speaks to everybody.

00:49:38.409 --> 00:49:39.744 align:middle line:90%
>> So what are you doing now?

00:49:39.744 --> 00:49:43.548 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you're into
all kinds of music production,

00:49:43.548 --> 00:49:46.517 align:middle line:84%
and you've done a lot of
genres since your days

00:49:46.517 --> 00:49:48.352 align:middle line:84%
with Public Enemy
and the other groups.

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:50.054 align:middle line:90%
So how are you looking it at --

00:49:50.054 --> 00:49:52.056 align:middle line:84%
I know you're starting something
called Shocklee Interactive is

00:49:52.056 --> 00:49:53.691 align:middle line:90%
going to be up in a while.

00:49:53.691 --> 00:49:54.892 align:middle line:90%
What is it you're trying to do?

00:49:54.892 --> 00:49:56.294 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:49:56.294 --> 00:50:01.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm building a media
platform and a networking base

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:06.104 align:middle line:84%
for artists that have
a conscious vibration.

00:50:06.104 --> 00:50:08.172 align:middle line:84%
And when I say "conscious,"
that doesn't mean that you have

00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:10.007 align:middle line:84%
to be overly seriously
conscious.

00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:11.442 align:middle line:90%
You just have to be for --

00:50:11.442 --> 00:50:11.976 align:middle line:90%
>> Thinking.

00:50:11.976 --> 00:50:12.677 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:50:12.677 --> 00:50:13.511 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to think.

00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:15.913 align:middle line:90%
>> And that doesn't exist now.

00:50:15.913 --> 00:50:17.014 align:middle line:90%
If you look at all the --

00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:19.951 align:middle line:84%
the blogs and things
that are going on,

00:50:19.951 --> 00:50:22.353 align:middle line:84%
it's all about celebrities
and that thing.

00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:27.458 align:middle line:84%
I'm more bringing it back and
dealing with art and dealing

00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:29.260 align:middle line:90%
with the artists themselves.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.964 align:middle line:84%
So we been developing
Shocklee.com as a vehicle

00:50:32.964 --> 00:50:37.902 align:middle line:84%
for helping to express and
promote these artists and ideas.

00:50:37.902 --> 00:50:39.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Will it be like multi-media?

00:50:39.137 --> 00:50:40.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Will there be some
ability to just like we are,

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.841 align:middle line:84%
hold conversations
about things --

00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:44.876 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:50:44.876 --> 00:50:45.943 align:middle line:84%
>> -- in addition
to the performance?

00:50:45.943 --> 00:50:47.879 align:middle line:84%
>> We're developing
a network that we --

00:50:47.879 --> 00:50:51.282 align:middle line:84%
and we already do
what is -- tutorials.

00:50:51.282 --> 00:50:55.753 align:middle line:84%
We have our Ableton Live
users group, you know,

00:50:55.753 --> 00:50:59.891 align:middle line:84%
tutorials that we
produce through Tekserve.

00:50:59.891 --> 00:51:03.261 align:middle line:84%
And those are things
that we're developing.

00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:06.164 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is for
us to create this kind

00:51:06.164 --> 00:51:11.669 align:middle line:84%
of like platform of awareness
and -- so that we can --

00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:12.870 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
the beautiful thing

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:15.439 align:middle line:84%
about the net is
that you can link.

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:19.243 align:middle line:84%
And so our mission and
goal is to be able to link

00:51:19.243 --> 00:51:23.848 align:middle line:84%
to every conscious organization,
whether you're putting out,

00:51:23.848 --> 00:51:26.784 align:middle line:84%
you know, whether you're
putting out a fruit drink

00:51:26.784 --> 00:51:31.389 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're creating a
new software or whatever it is

00:51:31.389 --> 00:51:33.991 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing, we want
you to be able to link.

00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:37.061 align:middle line:84%
We want to link into people
that have media channels

00:51:37.061 --> 00:51:39.497 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, because
we want to create this kind

00:51:39.497 --> 00:51:41.265 align:middle line:90%
of like one big voice.

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:42.733 align:middle line:90%
>> I saw your mission statement.

00:51:42.733 --> 00:51:43.634 align:middle line:90%
Very eloquent.

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:44.769 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:51:44.769 --> 00:51:47.371 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and thoroughly
addressing the times,

00:51:47.371 --> 00:51:49.407 align:middle line:84%
that people are looking
for this change inside,

00:51:49.407 --> 00:51:52.710 align:middle line:84%
not only externally, which
is a little harder going

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.779 align:middle line:84%
to change systems
on the outside.

00:51:54.779 --> 00:51:57.448 align:middle line:84%
But mostly to change the
internal thinking and systems.

00:51:57.448 --> 00:51:59.717 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like what
you're doing is addressing it

00:51:59.717 --> 00:52:00.551 align:middle line:90%
straight on.

00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And I have to thank Joanne.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.357 align:middle line:84%
You know, she's been the
spearhead behind that.

00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:09.293 align:middle line:84%
She's the person that's
been putting the hammer down

00:52:09.293 --> 00:52:11.395 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that
all the nuts and bolts

00:52:11.395 --> 00:52:13.898 align:middle line:84%
and everything is all tight
and everything is working.

00:52:13.898 --> 00:52:15.800 align:middle line:90%
So hats off to her.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.134 align:middle line:84%
>> And you were talking
about networks

00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:18.502 align:middle line:84%
and you're talking
about collaboration.

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:19.804 align:middle line:90%
I'm aware of a lot

00:52:19.804 --> 00:52:21.739 align:middle line:84%
of collaboration that's just
starting to be given birth

00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:24.008 align:middle line:84%
to behind the scenes
through a lot of entities

00:52:24.008 --> 00:52:25.576 align:middle line:90%
that are in alternative media.

00:52:25.576 --> 00:52:26.677 align:middle line:90%
For example, in one of them,

00:52:26.677 --> 00:52:29.213 align:middle line:84%
you're a big fan of,
the Alex Jones show.

00:52:29.213 --> 00:52:33.718 align:middle line:84%
You also -- I mean, that really
has kind of spoken to you

00:52:33.718 --> 00:52:35.119 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:37.788 align:middle line:84%
So what are some -- talk just
a little bit about, Alex,

00:52:37.788 --> 00:52:39.957 align:middle line:84%
what draws you to some of
the other shows you're --

00:52:39.957 --> 00:52:43.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Alex, George Noory
Coast to Coast.

00:52:43.261 --> 00:52:47.231 align:middle line:84%
I mean -- and those are my
two favorites, you know.

00:52:47.231 --> 00:52:50.534 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I -- you
know, I follow --

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:53.004 align:middle line:84%
I've been following
David Eick for years now.

00:52:53.004 --> 00:52:54.505 align:middle line:90%
So I kind of like know.

00:52:54.505 --> 00:52:57.875 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I think that the
thing that I find that's really,

00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:00.745 align:middle line:84%
really cool and what's starting
to happen is there's starting

00:53:00.745 --> 00:53:02.680 align:middle line:84%
to be an awakening
that's going on.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:03.881 --> 00:53:05.249 align:middle line:84%
>> People are starting to
realize that, you know,

00:53:05.249 --> 00:53:09.654 align:middle line:84%
there's things that are not good
that's happening and we need

00:53:09.654 --> 00:53:13.424 align:middle line:84%
to start to address those issues
-- or at least look at them.

00:53:13.424 --> 00:53:17.295 align:middle line:84%
And I think -- and I think
that that's now the forefront

00:53:17.295 --> 00:53:19.664 align:middle line:90%
of becoming an informed public.

00:53:19.664 --> 00:53:23.868 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we need to
have more [inaudible] channels,

00:53:23.868 --> 00:53:28.606 align:middle line:84%
we need to have more shows
like Coast to Coast and Alex.

00:53:28.606 --> 00:53:29.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. Absolutely.

00:53:29.974 --> 00:53:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And what about -- you also
speak of the "new frequency."

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:34.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:34.278 --> 00:53:35.279 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a term, if you look
you up online, you're going

00:53:35.279 --> 00:53:37.248 align:middle line:84%
to see the new frequency
spoken of.

00:53:37.248 --> 00:53:39.150 align:middle line:90%
What is the new frequency?

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:41.285 align:middle line:84%
>> New frequency is
higher consciousness.

00:53:41.285 --> 00:53:44.555 align:middle line:84%
It's us leaving behind all our
petty differences, understanding

00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:49.093 align:middle line:84%
that race and religion
and sex and all

00:53:49.093 --> 00:53:53.264 align:middle line:84%
that stuff is a paradigm
that's out [inaudible] dated

00:53:53.264 --> 00:53:57.835 align:middle line:84%
and we start to think as human
beings, because our job is

00:53:57.835 --> 00:54:00.638 align:middle line:84%
for us as human beings
to live on,

00:54:00.638 --> 00:54:03.841 align:middle line:90%
for us to perpetually dominate

00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and take our rightful
place on this planet.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We're human beings, and the
false divisions really can't

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.416 align:middle line:84%
survive much longer because
we're going to need each other.

00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:15.353 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, community,
collaboration,

00:54:15.353 --> 00:54:17.955 align:middle line:84%
all of it is really
where we're headed.

00:54:17.955 --> 00:54:19.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Because if you look at it

00:54:19.657 --> 00:54:21.692 align:middle line:84%
from we all breathe
the same air.

00:54:21.692 --> 00:54:24.929 align:middle line:90%
We all occupy the same space.

00:54:24.929 --> 00:54:26.664 align:middle line:90%
We all do -- everything

00:54:26.664 --> 00:54:29.333 align:middle line:84%
in our biological
systems are all the same.

00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:31.469 align:middle line:84%
So there's really
no differences.

00:54:31.469 --> 00:54:35.206 align:middle line:84%
And that's what that higher
consciousness is all about.

00:54:35.206 --> 00:54:36.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:54:36.507 --> 00:54:38.209 align:middle line:84%
And I was just reading this
morning, as I was thinking

00:54:38.209 --> 00:54:41.846 align:middle line:84%
about our interview, it was
going into my mind in that way,

00:54:41.846 --> 00:54:46.350 align:middle line:84%
which is, it was an
article on how 70 percent

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:49.720 align:middle line:84%
of the American workforce
dislikes

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:54.658 align:middle line:84%
or even hates their jobs, have
contempt often for their peers

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:58.429 align:middle line:84%
or the managers and so forth,
and that it has turned into --

00:54:58.429 --> 00:55:00.164 align:middle line:84%
the workforce has
turned into more of a

00:55:00.164 --> 00:55:02.733 align:middle line:84%
"zombie land" is
the way they put it.

00:55:02.733 --> 00:55:04.435 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not designed for that.

00:55:04.435 --> 00:55:07.037 align:middle line:84%
You know, people are
not -- are not --

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:09.740 align:middle line:90%
people want to be creative.

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.810 align:middle line:84%
People want to feel a
sense of self-worth.

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:16.781 align:middle line:84%
When you take away people's
ability to have self-worth

00:55:16.781 --> 00:55:20.217 align:middle line:84%
and then you put them in the box
and tell them they can only move

00:55:20.217 --> 00:55:22.887 align:middle line:84%
within this little
cubicle, well, then,

00:55:22.887 --> 00:55:24.555 align:middle line:90%
they're going to resent that.

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:26.757 align:middle line:90%
That's just a human experience.

00:55:26.757 --> 00:55:31.662 align:middle line:84%
And that's -- and I think that's
part and parcel done purposely

00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:36.066 align:middle line:84%
so that they can create this
drone society that don't have --

00:55:36.066 --> 00:55:38.335 align:middle line:84%
that don't respond, that
don't have any emotions

00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:39.703 align:middle line:90%
or any feelings.

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:43.874 align:middle line:84%
Emotion and feelings and all
these things are natural for us

00:55:43.874 --> 00:55:45.843 align:middle line:90%
that we supposed to express.

00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:47.678 align:middle line:84%
When we're not allowed
to express that,

00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:50.314 align:middle line:84%
then we're creating something
that's unnatural for us.

00:55:50.314 --> 00:55:51.816 align:middle line:90%
So what you see in terms of --

00:55:51.816 --> 00:55:53.517 align:middle line:84%
we just have a couple
minutes left --

00:55:53.517 --> 00:55:56.620 align:middle line:84%
in what you're observing, you
spoke to it a little bit ago,

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.023 align:middle line:84%
with the youth, because
I'm a big fan

00:55:59.023 --> 00:56:01.025 align:middle line:90%
of the upcoming generations.

00:56:01.025 --> 00:56:03.561 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be coming in
with a little bit more wisdom

00:56:03.561 --> 00:56:06.363 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes a lot more
wisdom, a lot more ability.

00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:07.765 align:middle line:90%
What are you seeing out there?

00:56:07.765 --> 00:56:09.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I -- definitely.

00:56:09.233 --> 00:56:11.235 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what I see
is that's happening,

00:56:11.235 --> 00:56:14.772 align:middle line:84%
that the youth are talking what
we're talking about right here

00:56:14.772 --> 00:56:16.340 align:middle line:90%
and actually applying it.

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Not only are they applying it,
they're taking it to new levels

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.012 align:middle line:84%
at the levels that
they can take it at.

00:56:22.012 --> 00:56:25.049 align:middle line:84%
For example, you know,
the whole computer age,

00:56:25.049 --> 00:56:28.652 align:middle line:84%
the kids are using
computers and cell phones

00:56:28.652 --> 00:56:31.255 align:middle line:84%
like we would never
even imagine.

00:56:31.255 --> 00:56:36.293 align:middle line:84%
And they're networking
with them very efficiently.

00:56:36.293 --> 00:56:39.597 align:middle line:84%
And so they're taking the
stuff that they're given,

00:56:39.597 --> 00:56:44.301 align:middle line:84%
and they're actually applying
it to other situations

00:56:44.301 --> 00:56:46.036 align:middle line:90%
that creates a greater good.

00:56:46.036 --> 00:56:49.173 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question is,
is that they need help.

00:56:49.173 --> 00:56:51.242 align:middle line:90%
And this is where we come in,

00:56:51.242 --> 00:56:52.877 align:middle line:84%
where we should be
doing our job.

00:56:52.877 --> 00:56:56.714 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like me as an
adult, I've kind of failed them

00:56:56.714 --> 00:57:00.651 align:middle line:84%
in that respect because we
didn't set up institutions

00:57:00.651 --> 00:57:02.486 align:middle line:90%
that would allow them to be able

00:57:02.486 --> 00:57:06.090 align:middle line:84%
to manifest their
realities or their dreams.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:07.491 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's what
you're trying to do now.

00:57:07.491 --> 00:57:08.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:08.893 --> 00:57:11.262 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that's partly what
Shocklee Interactive is going

00:57:11.262 --> 00:57:14.398 align:middle line:90%
about, Shocklee.com.

00:57:14.398 --> 00:57:15.866 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing,
too, that --

00:57:15.866 --> 00:57:20.371 align:middle line:84%
that I think is really kind of
an unintended effect here is,

00:57:20.371 --> 00:57:24.441 align:middle line:84%
we're going into an era where
the species itself is beginning

00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:27.378 align:middle line:84%
to transform and transcend into
higher states of awareness,

00:57:27.378 --> 00:57:30.080 align:middle line:84%
as you talked about,
which also means

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.449 align:middle line:84%
that we can operate more
beyond time and space,

00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:33.817 align:middle line:90%
telepathically for example.

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:35.319 align:middle line:90%
That's becoming very common.

00:57:35.319 --> 00:57:37.521 align:middle line:84%
And these kids and
what they're doing,

00:57:37.521 --> 00:57:40.524 align:middle line:84%
their lives are almost
completely transparent.

00:57:40.524 --> 00:57:41.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

00:57:41.525 --> 00:57:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And that, you
know, we're like, oh,

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.931 align:middle line:84%
I don't want my personal details
to be known, but the reality is,

00:57:46.931 --> 00:57:49.266 align:middle line:84%
whether we like it or not,
we're going into a phase

00:57:49.266 --> 00:57:51.535 align:middle line:84%
of transparency all
with each other,

00:57:51.535 --> 00:57:53.237 align:middle line:84%
so we need to stop
the separation

00:57:53.237 --> 00:57:54.538 align:middle line:90%
and lying it seems to me.

00:57:54.538 --> 00:57:55.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:57:55.773 --> 00:57:58.242 align:middle line:84%
Stop the fronting and
let's get down to business.

00:57:58.242 --> 00:57:59.577 align:middle line:90%
>> You bet.

00:57:59.577 --> 00:58:01.946 align:middle line:84%
It was a been an absolute
pleasure being with you, Hank.

00:58:01.946 --> 00:58:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:58:04.048 --> 00:58:06.083 align:middle line:90%
And thank everyone here.

00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:07.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Hank is becoming
involved in a number

00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:10.387 align:middle line:84%
