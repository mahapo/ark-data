00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:23.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Many of the world's

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.040 align:middle line:10%
ancient religious traditions
have brought valuable knowledge

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
forward about healing
the mind and body.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:10%
Shamini Jain was raised in
the Jain tradition in India,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:10%
a religion many of us
know very little about.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Today she's going to tell us
about Indo-Tibetan healing

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
practices, which have an
intriguingly different view

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
of how the body and soul
juxtapose to each other

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.020 align:middle line:90%
and work together.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:90%
I think it's really interesting.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you are into some
really exciting stuff right

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So before we get into the
subject, just top us off.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.487 align:middle line:84%
You're the founding director
of something pretty impressive.

00:00:55.487 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAMINI JAIN: Well, thank you.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I'm very pleased and
honored to be here, first.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, Regina.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, we're up to
some really fun things.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the founding
director of a collaborative

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:84%
called The Consciousness
and Healing Initiative.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And our goal is to scale the
science and practice of healing

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:84%
by bringing communities
together to really create--

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and I know this is a very
buzzword these days--

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.715 align:middle line:90%
a new alchemy of healing.

00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, interesting.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.715 align:middle line:84%
Because in my last
interview, we were talking

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of alchemy.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:90%
And it is true.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
It's really going to take the
wisdom of these traditions

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
plus modern science,
plus intuitives, plus,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:84%
plus, in order to
ground us in a much more

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
efficient way of understanding
our body-mind matrix.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think the implications,
especially today,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:90%
are just vast.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:10%
We're coming to such exciting
and such important times

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:10%
that I think all
of our community

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:10%
can agree that scaling healing
and the wisdom of understanding

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:10%
the power of consciousness
is really just imperative.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:10%
It's imperative.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So you started out more in
the scientific realm, right?

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.095 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: That's right.

00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're a
psychologist, right?

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: That's correct.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.239 align:middle line:84%
Also, you call yourself
a social entrepreneur.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And we'll find out how
these things-- and I guess

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.363 align:middle line:84%
your initiative right there
explains how these two

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:90%
things fold in together.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But how did the world
of material sciences

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.084 align:middle line:84%
initially start letting
you down to the extent

00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
that you've gone the
direction you have?

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Yeah, thank
you for that question.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that when I was
first in college at Columbia

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.820 align:middle line:84%
University is when
I really realized

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
how fractured science is and
what a sad state of affairs

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
we have currently with the
separateness of perspectives

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
in science and the holding
onto a particular--

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
what I would call really a
monocultural, ethnocentric view

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
in science that is plaguing
medicine as we know it today.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
know from history

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
that some of this happened
because of issues,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
political issues
between the church

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and science with Descartes,
who of course, you may know,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
was actually a firm
believer in God.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
political situations

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
at that time, proposed
dualism, proposed rationalism.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And basically the
idea was, OK, well,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
all of you religious folks get
to play in the spirit world,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and we will just focus on the
here and now natural sciences.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But we lost something, because
we lost animism in science,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:90%
and it was discredited.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we, in my view, have
been suffering ever since.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
wake up call for me

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.060 align:middle line:84%
was when I heard
a professor say,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
there's no plasticity in
the brain after age seven.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:90%
So this was in the '90s.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a student.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:90%
I knew nothing.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But I knew enough to know that
that statement seemed pretty

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
preposterous, especially given
that there was very little

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:90%
data to base it on.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.708 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Considering the brain
is still forming until well

00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:90%
into the 20s.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Exactly.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
I had in my mind

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:84%
was, well, how do
they know that?

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%
How are they so sure of it?

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized that
religion and science sometimes

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
are not so separate
in that there's

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
significant dogmatism
in science that

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.936 align:middle line:90%
is causing a problem today.

00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
really what brought

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.684 align:middle line:84%
us to begin the initiative--
to understand that there are

00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:84%
multiplicities in perspectives,
that it's a need for us,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:84%
at this point, to bring
together those multiplicities

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
of perspective if we really
want to scale healing in the way

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.347 align:middle line:90%
that we need to do.

00:04:15.347 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you take
it down to a discipline,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
psychoneuroimmunology
really is the discipline

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:90%
you're working with here.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: That's correct.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the many
disciplines, of course.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:90%
It's one that I was trained in.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was drawn to it because
in cognitive neuroscience,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I realized very quickly,
especially in the early '90s,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that while I thought it would
be more systems oriented,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't, really.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.248 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was the brain.

00:04:35.248 --> 00:04:37.162 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting with my
professor at the time.

00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
We had actually-- I was
just about to graduate.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
know, I don't know

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
why people are still
studying things like skin

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:90%
conductance in the heart.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:90%
We have the brain.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:90%
And I just thought, wow, OK.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a system.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:90%
It's an interconnected system.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And so psychoneuroimmunology
was, of course,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
formed understanding that if we
wanted to really scale anything

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:84%
in the way of
medicine and healing,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:84%
we needed to start
talking to each other.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
We needed to understand how
the system is connected.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a great
basis, I think,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
for starting to explore
the question of how

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
does energy affect us,
of course mentally,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, emotionally,
and also physically.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So honestly, traditional
psychoimmunologists

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
are still not open to
a lot of these ideas.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:84%
But within our initiative,
The Consciousness

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and Healing Initiative, we
have many leading scientists

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
in psychoneuroimmunology,
in biophysics, in medicine,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and healers who are
all working together

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
to deeply explore the
nature of consciousness

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
for healing on all
of these levels.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's really quite exciting.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.099 align:middle line:84%
And we hope to just
continue to scale it.

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:43.898 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:43.898 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I find what's particularly
exciting about it is-- well,

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.111 align:middle line:84%
this audience is
pretty well-informed.

00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Most of them have been reading
about these connections

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:90%
for decades.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is in doing it this way,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:84%
you're now bringing
the masses on board.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
The potential is to bring
the masses on board.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.039 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
where it has to happen.

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:01.838 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:06:01.838 --> 00:06:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And to help, I think,
our communities.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So we understand all
of us specialize.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's unrealistic
to expect a healer

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:84%
to be able to rattle off
30 scientific studies.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And yet they have
this issue where--

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a very
specific example.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.862 align:middle line:84%
I had a healer friend
write me and say,

00:06:19.862 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:84%
quick, I need you to send
me all the studies that you

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.192 align:middle line:84%
know about on healing
that are really top notch.

00:06:25.192 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:90%
And so I sent him that.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
We've actually
built an infographic

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
that people can really get
into that shows basically

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.954 align:middle line:84%
all of the data behind
hands-off healing

00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
so that people can share
that with their colleagues,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.036 align:middle line:84%
with their medical
professionals, or whatever.

00:06:37.036 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:90%
So I sent him these papers.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later,
I inquired with him.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And I said, so how did that go?

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.998 align:middle line:90%
What did you need them?

00:06:43.998 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I knew he was doing some
healing work with PTSD patients

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.545 align:middle line:90%
in a clinic in the Midwest.

00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said, thank you,
thank you, thank you,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.961 align:middle line:84%
because the patients
have been saying

00:06:51.961 --> 00:06:53.152 align:middle line:90%
how useful this is for them.

00:06:53.152 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But we really wanted
to scale this.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I was able to show
them the scientific papers,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:84%
they gave us $300,000
so that we could

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.514 align:middle line:84%
scale our work more effective
and pay the healers, which

00:07:02.514 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:90%
is what should happen.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, absolutely.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's not just
for the professionals.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It's people like
our audience here,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
who have understood
these things may

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
have different certifications
and various healing

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:84%
practices and such and so forth,
but are still around the family

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
dinner table trying to
somehow validate what they do.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into this
whole structure that's

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:90%
critical thinking in nature.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.048 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean as
in critical thinking.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean as in criticizing
one another for something

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
we're not familiar with, that
kind of ignorance of what

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it sounds like
there's an apparatus here.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Is there an apparatus here
for the average person

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
to tap into and get their
hands on these studies

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.347 align:middle line:84%
so when they do meet with
their sister the next time,

00:07:48.347 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
they can say no, no, here I have
a couple of studies on this I

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:90%
think you'll find interesting?

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.355 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.271 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Start bringing
a larger conversation

00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:90%
to every man and woman's table.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:84%
It's all about trying to
find a common language.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.442 align:middle line:84%
And what I've learned
in the different worlds

00:08:03.442 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that I've walked is
it's really important

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:84%
to understand someone's
language and then speak to it.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and yet none of us have time
to really learn a new language.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But when we put our
languages together,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
that's where we can first
share, and then second,

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.772 align:middle line:84%
create a new emergent language
that perhaps is more universal

00:08:18.772 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:90%
that people understand.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that is often
the language of experience.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
That's usually the universal
language, is experience itself.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet if we really want to
make sure that patients who

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
are suffering today from things
like chronic pain, cancer,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.034 align:middle line:90%
and other things--

00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:84%
if we really want to
make sure that they

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.880 align:middle line:84%
have healing services in
place, the science language

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And so part of our role
is to help bridge that gap

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and share the
science more broadly

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:90%
with communities that need it.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we find
that it's really important

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
to evolve science so that it's
no longer insert healer here,

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:90%
or insert meditator here.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And you come into my study,
and I tell you what to do.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
We really need to
listen more deeply

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to our spiritual
practitioners and our healers

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and understand what they're
saying so that we can develop

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.300 align:middle line:90%
better ways of studying spirit.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're up to that kind of
work in the initiative as well.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.272 align:middle line:90%
It's good work.

00:09:15.272 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And so in general,
you're saying we

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.832 align:middle line:84%
need to move away
from disease thinking,

00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and then that we have moved
through, or are moving through,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:84%
what you call the
Decade of the Brain

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:90%
toward whole systems thinking.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, explain to
people what you mean

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:90%
by the Decade of the Brain.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Sure.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.594 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until just
recently that everything,

00:09:31.594 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned, was
brain, brain, brain.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
We got really excited about
how the brain lights up

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.530 align:middle line:90%
to this and that.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.889 align:middle line:84%
That's where we were in the
'90s and even the 2000s.

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And now, of course, we're
getting a little more systems

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
oriented, but it's still
the brain connectome,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:90%
the brain this, the brain that.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's just this constant
self-referential process.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So when people are
studying what are commonly

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
termed in mainstream science
mind-body practices, which

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
of course are really
mind-body-spirit practices,

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
it's still what can meditation
do for me, for example.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:84%
What can meditation do for my
brain, my cognition, my health?

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And what the scientists
in our initiative

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:84%
are really interested in is
moving from the power of me

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:90%
to the power of we.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So one of our projects
is really to see

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
if we can replicate and extend
some of the fine work that

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.760 align:middle line:84%
was done by Maharishi
International University

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.989 align:middle line:84%
scientists many
years ago and say,

00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
what happens when we come
together in collective prayer

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.152 align:middle line:90%
and meditation?

00:10:30.152 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
There's more and more
impetus to do that.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Lots of people want to do that.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:84%
How do we synchronize
together biologically?

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
What kind of information
transfer is happening?

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And then how can we
understand and scale that

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to promote more peace in the
world and reduce violence?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But we have the
tools now, I think,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand this
on a scientific level in ways

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't a
few decades ago.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
work to be done.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:84%
They've done some beautiful
work there at the university.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's interesting,
because a lot

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
of the funding, a lot
of the media and such

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:84%
is going into the dysfunction
and breakdown of the brain--

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:84%
primarily, in my opinion,
because the baby boomers are

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
starting to age, and
now Alzheimer's is

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:90%
becoming an issue.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And the boomers are
the me generation,

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:90%
as I was chuckling a moment ago.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.840 align:middle line:84%
So of course, holding
the purse strings,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:84%
being the me generation,
and now starting to say,

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
well, this is not working
out too well for my brain--

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be where the
real highlight, focus, money,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:90%
studies are all going right now.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:28.905 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:28.905 --> 00:11:29.705 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:31.950 align:middle line:84%
It's always disease
process, disease pathology,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.919 align:middle line:90%
and preventing me from dying.

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
singularity movement.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:84%
There's very interesting
stuff going on there,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
wanting to live forever
and all of that.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But we're also at a
crisis point that I think

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:90%
people understand right now.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:90%
We have a crisis in dogmatism.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.562 align:middle line:84%
We have a crisis of
my way or the highway,

00:11:49.562 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding and my
truth is wider than your truth,

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:90%
all of this.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I think many of us feel
a need to really come together

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and say, let's talk
about collective truth.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about collective
healing and the sustainability

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:90%
of our planet.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And again, that requires
the younger generations

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.190 align:middle line:84%
to come in and start
looking at the need

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
to move beyond not
just yourselves,

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:90%
but the next generation, even.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is really, I think,
where the me generation--

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:90%
the boomers-- kind of fell down.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:84%
We always say we think
it will be wonderful

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.702 align:middle line:84%
if we can unite the boomers
with the millennials, and really

00:12:25.702 --> 00:12:26.535 align:middle line:90%
all the generations.

00:12:26.535 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, you saw that--

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.891 align:middle line:84%
if you take it politically,
you saw that at, say,

00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Bernie Sanders rallies.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
You had a lot of
people in their 60s

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of kids in their
20s, and the middle generations

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
didn't seem to be as present
at a lot of those events.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And so it is possible
they were coming together

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:84%
for some progressive
potential politically.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But the same thing
has to happen in terms

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.880 align:middle line:90%
of our healing and medicine.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to say
that fine work isn't

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:84%
being done with a lot of these
neuroscientists and such.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:84%
There's amazing discoveries
about the brain.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.699 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not throwing
any of it out.

00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was
funny after you were saying

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.155 align:middle line:90%
we need to move from me to we.

00:13:03.155 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yes.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, on that note, I will just
mention we're getting there.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.652 align:middle line:84%
So there's some really
fabulous new mainstream

00:13:08.652 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
work that's starting
to be done now

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
looking at
inter-brain synchrony,

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:84%
finally, and exploring that,
and their roles of empathy,

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:90%
reducing pain, cooperation.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're slowly,
slowly moving there.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.784 align:middle line:84%
But the job of our initiative
is to move more quickly,

00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:90%
to scale there more rapidly.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot wait another 50
years to place consciousness

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
at the center of
healing in medicine.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.724 align:middle line:90%
We have to do that now.

00:13:29.724 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
seems to me you're

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:84%
getting down philosophically to
some really simple constructs,

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:35.730 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at how these
brains synchronize together,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:84%
the notion of cooperation
versus competition

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
in our entire societal structure
is based on competition

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
up to this point, which
has to be incredibly

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.452 align:middle line:84%
damaging, in a way,
to our own physical,

00:13:50.452 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:90%
mental, and emotional health.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.201 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Absolutely,
because we're not

00:13:53.201 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
operating within the full
spectrum of our consciousness.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is plaguing
all of the problems.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And again, it's me.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yes.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.671 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's interesting,
because we talk a lot

00:14:02.671 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:90%
about desire and manifestation.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
considering that today.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're
going to be talking

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.650 align:middle line:90%
a bit about the Jan tradition.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
a lot of questions

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.530 align:middle line:84%
sometimes around these
Vedic traditions,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Vedic-based traditions,
and the idea

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
let go of desire.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's maybe
a misperception there.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you on that.

00:14:20.418 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: It's the question of
where desire is coming from.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about my
desire versus collective desire

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:90%
versus spirit-aligned desire.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think what some
of the Vedic wisdom

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
is teaching us is that
it's not necessarily

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
letting go of desire as much as
it is aligning with divine will

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:84%
so that you can open to
a bigger perspective,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that that little
me consciousness that you have

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:90%
is really causing suffering.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:90%
And we see that now.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:90%
We see it all over the planet.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.402 align:middle line:84%
That little me consciousness is
wreaking havoc on our bodies--

00:14:53.402 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the mind.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.676 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: And our environments.

00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.667 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't agree more.

00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing in
this universe that

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
would exist without some
kind of higher desire

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and without some kind of
divinely ordered desire.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything exists through
desire and desired outcome.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter who the
creator of it is, right?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that is--
it's been something

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
been maligned a bit

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.550 align:middle line:84%
in our common interpretations
of ancient cultures, which

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:84%
of course there's a lot
of misinterpretation that

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.130 align:middle line:90%
happens there along the way.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.205 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at--
it's not Jainism?

00:15:27.205 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Jan?

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Both are
correct, actually.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a dipthong.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So some people do say Jane,
and some people say Jan,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:90%
and both are correct.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were
raised in a household that

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:90%
was steeped in this tradition.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.646 align:middle line:84%
So talk a little bit
about that before we start

00:15:39.646 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:90%
going into the particulars.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Because like all religions, it
has very beautiful components

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and some quirky components,
and some antiquated components,

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and then other factions say
yes, they are antiquated,

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:90%
we're going this direction.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yes, absolutely.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
makes it a religion.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
makes it a religion.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your household

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:90%
and what that meant growing up.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Sure.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So one of my
earliest memories was

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:84%
going up to our
little library attic

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and seeing, next
to my mom's "Cosmo"

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
magazines, books like "Easy
Journey to Other Planets"

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So both were totally
unfathomable, right?

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But I was always drawn to those
Jan books at an early age.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.456 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we had
practice at home too.

00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is practice?

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Jains, for example, are
taught very fundamental life

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:84%
principles that I think are
really relevant to society

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And three of those fundamental
principles, Regina,

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
are Ahimsa, which
is nonviolence,

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Anekantawd, which is the truth
in multiple perspectives,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and Aparigraha, which
is translated usually

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
as non-possession,
but can be linked

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:90%
to the principle of sufficiency.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So these are the principles
that we were raised with.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we were
taught prayers and things

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I was just surrounded by
that culture, you could say,

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of books.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been an
avid reader, always a very

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:90%
curious person, curious child.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I would start
reading those books

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and start reading
about all the things

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:84%
they said about the different
subtle bodies and the effects

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.859 align:middle line:84%
of yoga on the parasympathetic
nervous system, this thing

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
that I had never even heard
of as a nine-year-old.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was fascinating to me.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.307 align:middle line:84%
So kind of early on, I thought,
how did they know this?

00:17:18.307 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:90%
How are they mapping it all out?

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Jainism really prides
itself on being scientific.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They have a whole
mapped-out metaphysics

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:84%
for understanding
the nature of soul,

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:84%
the nature of
consciousness, and how

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that relates to
liberation, which is really

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:90%
the utmost goal in Jainism.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So there is an understanding
that gods exist.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.610 align:middle line:84%
There is actually a description
of many different realms

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:90%
besides the human ones--

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:84%
the [NON-ENGLISH] or
the heavenly realms,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:90%
the hellish realms.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:84%
It's considered to
actually be quite a boon

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to be incarnated in
human form, because it's

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:84%
believed that only by being
incarnated in human form, where

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:84%
you can experience both
pleasure and suffering, pleasure

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and pain, can you
transcend all of that

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:90%
to become fully liberated.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the goal is really
for full liberation,

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
which is a deep connection
with one's totality, divinity

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
As the Vevic principles
would say, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in your
household, I would assume,

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
generally speaking,
your household

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.340 align:middle line:84%
was one of peace
and open-mindedness?

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair to say?

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.996 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Well, we're all human.

00:18:28.996 --> 00:18:30.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
were working at it.

00:18:30.775 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, what was fun, really--

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:90%
one of the things--

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.156 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in South
Carolina, so all my friends

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:90%
were Baptist Christian.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would go to
church with them.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while, when
the pastor started looking at me

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and saying, if you don't believe
in Jesus, you're going to hell,

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I realized, well,
maybe I don't need

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to be going to church
with them anymore.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But yet within me
and my friends,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
there was really this
mutual respect and curiosity

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:90%
for each other's paths.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So we would share, and they
were very interested in Jainism

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and asked me why we
didn't eat meat, why

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:90%
we practice the things we did.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Why do monks and nuns
from the Jan tradition

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.620 align:middle line:90%
wear a cover on their mouth?

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, they do that because
they firmly believe

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:90%
in the principles of Ahimsa.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And they have taken vows to say
I'm going to try to follow this

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:90%
as much as I can.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm conscious
of the organisms

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:90%
that I'm breathing in and out.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And by placing a simple
thing on my mouth that's

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:84%
no trouble to me, I
kill less organisms.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And so that's their choice.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you also
see some of the monastics

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
walking with a broom,
because they walk,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want to step
on insects, even unwittingly.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So they consciously
just make sure

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that if there's
anything in their path,

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.192 align:middle line:90%
they don't step on it.

00:19:42.192 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
reverence for all life.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:90%
It's quite beautiful.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a non-theistic
religion, right?

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Correct.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So what that means,
really, is that the belief

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:84%
in the utmost divinity is
the belief in one's own soul,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.330 align:middle line:84%
in the totality
of one's own soul.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So gods are understood
to be present.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:90%
They are respected.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for what we
call the tirthankaras,

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:84%
or jinas, who are--
you can think of them

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:84%
as the Bodhisattvas
for Buddhism.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones who became
enlightened and stayed

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
in human form to teach the way
of enlightenment to others.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So for them, there is utmost
liberation, and yet a decision

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
to stay in human form for
the remainder of their life

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and not leave the body
right away to teach that.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is who
Jains try to emulate.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It's more about receiving that
total liberation, understanding

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.096 align:middle line:84%
that you may have help
from beings along the way,

00:20:39.096 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily
trying to get

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
to heaven as the
utmost result. That

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
may happen as a result
of karma, reincarnation.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:84%
You may incarnate in
one realm or another.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate
goal is liberation.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the establishment of Jainism,

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
sixth century BCE,
as almost a pushback

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:84%
against Orthodox
Romamism, right?

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.589 align:middle line:90%
So that was, I think, where--

00:20:59.589 --> 00:21:01.421 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was going
on at the time that

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
needed to be pushed back
against, in your mind?

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Sure.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So delving into what
we call Jan history,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:90%
there are a few things.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.752 align:middle line:84%
One is that Jainism, as it's
been described as Jainism,

00:21:11.752 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
it's true that it
seemed to emerge around

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
this time of sixth
century BCE as a result

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:90%
of some disagreements.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But really, the
practice of Jainism

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.610 align:middle line:90%
occurred well before that.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And people who practiced this
path were called [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.900 align:middle line:10%
So there is actually
history dating

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.880 align:middle line:10%
to one of the previous jinas,
whose name was Parshvanatha.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:10%
He was the 23rd tirthankara,
or as I said, jina.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.690 align:middle line:10%
Around 6th century
BC, we had Mahavir,

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:10%
who was the 24th
tirthankara of our time.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:84%
He was actually a
contemporary of the Buddha,

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
of Buddha as we know
him, a little bit older.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.896 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it's likely
that they had met,

00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:84%
but they are not
the same person.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:90%
They're different people.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Around that time,
there was disagreement

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.900 align:middle line:84%
among the people
who were practicing

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.100 align:middle line:84%
this form of what we call
Jainism the Brahmins for two

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:90%
main reasons.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.550 align:middle line:84%
One, the Jains believed
that you didn't

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:84%
have to just be a
Brahmin to talk to God,

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that you had direct
connection with your divinity

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:84%
at all times, and that animal
sacrifices were not necessary.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Because of the Jan's
strong belief in Ahimsa,

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.780 align:middle line:84%
they did not feel that animal
sacrifices were the way

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:90%
to go for liberation.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
where they started

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:84%
to culturally separate
more from the Hindus

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:90%
and define their own path.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really also
where the idea of Jan laypeople

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:90%
started bearing more fruit.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Because as some who have
studied Jainism may know,

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
those who are monks, nuns
take very particular vows.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And among those are chastity,
non-stealing, non-possession,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:84%
non-harming, all
of these things.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So they really--
they go with nothing.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So they almost really are, in
a way, trusting in the universe

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
to provide things like
food when they need it.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
understood that if we

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
created a basis for laypeople
who weren't ready to take it

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:84%
to that level, but really wanted
to incorporate these principles

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.570 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, that we could
have this cooperative system.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:10%
So that's where the
established order of Jainism

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.820 align:middle line:10%
started, and there are many
different sects of Jainism.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.555 align:middle line:10%
The two main ones are the
Digambras and the Svetambaras.

00:23:30.555 --> 00:23:32.131 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Is one
more conservative?

00:23:32.131 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:10%
>>JAIN: The Digambras
are considered

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.462 align:middle line:10%
to be more conservative.

00:23:35.462 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I know there's always
questions about how

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
are women treated in all of
these organized religions.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:84%
There are some fundamental
differences between Digambras

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:90%
and Svetambaras.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.875 align:middle line:84%
I thought we'd get into
that in a little bit,

00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
because I found that part
absolutely fascinating.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But basically, you're looking
at a path of salvation

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
through perfection, through the
karmic wheel of reincarnations,

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: That's correct,
yeah, and really adherence

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:90%
to the principles.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So the ultimate
goal is liberation.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.460 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of steps
towards liberation.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the roles
of any spiritual practice

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:84%
is just how to live
a good life, how

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to live a life that matters, how
to live a life that is pleasing

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
and that helps others.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And so these
fundamental principles

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
of ahimsa, nonviolence, multiple
perspectives, and living

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.470 align:middle line:84%
according to the
law of sufficiency

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:84%
are really those
guiding principles

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
that of course have
an effect on karma,

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:84%
on what happens
during reincarnation.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:84%
But because one follows
those principles,

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.742 align:middle line:84%
there is naturally a change
in karmic flow that happens.

00:24:35.742 --> 00:24:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Because you can look at
it like a bank account.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, I've got this much bad
karma and this much good karma,

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.421 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be like
this in my next life,

00:24:42.421 --> 00:24:44.536 align:middle line:84%
so I have to do this
kind of meditation.

00:24:44.536 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of empty.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, just
starting with do no harm.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.724 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
good starting place

00:24:48.724 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:90%
in any incarnation, right?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Right, yeah.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as
natural vegetarians,

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:59.460 align:middle line:84%
how did the more conservative
or the more strict sects

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
of Jainism work with the whole
notion that plants have souls,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:84%
animals have souls, yet you
have to have sustenance.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you are going
to obviously eat

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.370 align:middle line:90%
from the plant kingdom.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:84%
How does that work out on
a spiritual soul level?

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Sure.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And plants have consciousness.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not
breathing bacteria,

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:90%
for example, how does that work?

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So the Jains do believe in
consciousness in all matter,

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:26.922 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:25:26.922 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:84%
They believe that
souls exist everywhere.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.379 align:middle line:84%
There are souls running
through this table

00:25:30.379 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:90%
right now, according to Jainism.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But they also believe in
the hierarchy of the senses.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
That is, how much do we
feel particular things

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:90%
like pain and suffering?

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And so with Jains, they
believe that animals and humans

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and plants and rocks
have consciousness.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.589 align:middle line:84%
But animals suffer more
from pain than plants do.

00:25:50.589 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have a different
type of nervous system

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:84%
that's more highly
developed, right?

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Exactly.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they suffer more from
the ramifications of killing,

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
for example, than
certain plants do.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Very strict Jains
will actually not

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.182 align:middle line:84%
eat things that
grow underground.

00:26:04.182 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And most people think
that's because when

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.224 align:middle line:84%
you pull the plant out
of the Earth, it's gone.

00:26:08.224 --> 00:26:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Like you pull a carrot out,
there is no more carrot.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:90%
The carrot doesn't grow back.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
like fruitarians.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.961 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Right, similar to that.

00:26:13.961 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of them don't eat
onions, don't eat garlic,

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:90%
don't eat potatoes.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
There are other reasons, too,
igniting the passions of--

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.152 align:middle line:84%
they say there are multiple
souls in things like garlic

00:26:23.152 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and onion, for example,
which is interesting thinking

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:90%
of the different layers.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:84%
But they do firmly believe in
the hierarchy of the senses.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.204 align:middle line:84%
So during our holy days,
which we call [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:26:32.204 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, where the laypeople
try to emulate more of the life

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
of a monk, it's said not to
eat even green leafy vegetables

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:84%
because there are so many
different insects and other

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.840 align:middle line:84%
organisms that subsist on
those that could get hurt

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.830 align:middle line:90%
in the process.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So they do-- they kind
of take it to that level.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And there is a reason why
people don't hear about Jainism.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not a
proselytizing religion.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not one that people
try to convert to.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty strict.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Extreme asceticism
at times, right?

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: It can seem that
way, especially in the West.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:84%
There's not a focus on flogging
oneself or anything like that.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:90%
But everything is done--

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:84%
these things that seem
very aesthetic to us,

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.710 align:middle line:84%
they're really just practices
to bring us closer to our souls.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.300 align:middle line:84%
They're really just
practices to help

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:84%
us recognize when we're in
that attachment aversion

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
paradox that sometimes
plagues our lives.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:90%
And so that's really the point.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so
with this religion,

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.040 align:middle line:10%
because it is reliant
upon the soul,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:10%
it's interesting
when you look at what

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:10%
is this wheel that we see that
has the concentric circles

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:10%
of our being.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.520 align:middle line:10%
What do you call this wheel?

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:10%
>>JAIN: Yeah, it's-- you
know, I don't know if it has

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:10%
a particular name.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:10%
I call it the Wheel
of Understanding.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.321 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The Wheel
of Understanding.

00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:10%
But interestingly, in a lot
of different understanding

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.657 align:middle line:10%
spiritual traditions, you
would have the physical,

00:27:53.657 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:10%
the mental, the emotional.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.800 align:middle line:10%
It goes out, and ultimately,
you have the soul

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:10%
as this more nebulous outer
ring of the concentric circle.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:10%
This has the soul
at the center of it.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately, that
is who you answer to,

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
who you are responsible to
and for the development of.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.196 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: That's
absolutely correct.

00:28:12.196 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:90%
The soul is really your essence.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:84%
The soul is your true
essence, your pure essence.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And I love this
model, and I'd love

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.920 align:middle line:84%
to try to break it
down a little bit.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So if we think about our
ultimate being, our true being,

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:90%
it's really the soul.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:26.510 align:middle line:90%
And what is the soul?

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:90%
The soul is pure light.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:90%
It's pure consciousness.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:10%
We come into embodied
form in the soul.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.530 align:middle line:10%
And so certain aspects of
the light and consciousness

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:10%
in our soul are obscured
by what we call karma.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is karma?

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
definitions of karma.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:10%
I think of karma as the
result of our thoughts, words,

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.360 align:middle line:10%
and deeds.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.420 align:middle line:10%
And so in the Jan tradition,
it's understood that karma--

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.030 align:middle line:10%
and this is where it differs
from many sects of Buddhism--

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.841 align:middle line:10%
karma is considered real.

00:28:53.841 --> 00:28:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Karma is considered actually--

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like a
subtle matter, right?

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Very subtle matter.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Explain this more to us.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: So the way
karma interacts

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:84%
with the soul is literally to
form almost a sheath around it.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:84%
You can think of a cloud
surrounding a soul that

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.700 align:middle line:84%
is a dynamic cloud,
and it's really

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.060 align:middle line:84%
being fed by everything you're
thinking, doing, and feeling.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So the light of
the soul is really

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
being filtered through
this karmic body.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
We call it the [NON-ENGLISH],,
or the karmic body.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that filtering
light is actually

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
what gives rise to all of these
other aspects that are more

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:84%
gross that begin to
push into the physical.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually where
the bioenergetic body,

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:84%
what we call in Western science
the biofield, comes about.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a direct result of the
interaction of your soul

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.480 align:middle line:90%
with the karmic sheath.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.560 align:middle line:84%
That forms what we in Jainism
call the [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:84%
or kind of like the
electric or fiery body.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:84%
In Vedic traditions, it's
called the [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:84%
The biofield is
essentially that interface

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.170 align:middle line:84%
between the soul and
the physical body.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have this filtering
of light through karma

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.310 align:middle line:84%
which is then carried out by
the biofield, which gives rise

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:84%
to thoughts, gives
rise to emotions,

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:84%
gives rise even to our
physical attributes,

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.510 align:middle line:90%
our physical bodies, our selves.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the emanations
of soul consciousness

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.360 align:middle line:84%
through these sheets,
through these bodies

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:84%
that really help us
understand the nature

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness, where
our consciousness is at.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's completely dynamic.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And karma is not the
absence of free will.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, karma just basically
reflects your actions,

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.580 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's really fascinating.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And as scientists, we're
really just wanting to dive

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.000 align:middle line:84%
more deeply into this connection
between the soul and the body

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
different aspects.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
get into the specific lineage

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.230 align:middle line:90%
of healing and how that works.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I found some of it fascinating
and some of it kind of quirky.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem
antiquated, but maybe

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.770 align:middle line:84%
you can explain the actual
principles behind it--

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.280 align:middle line:84%
for example, the notion
that just in being feminine,

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.000 align:middle line:84%
it's already creating an
inequality spiritually

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.864 align:middle line:84%
with men, with the
masculine, for example.

00:31:09.864 --> 00:31:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: That is really coming
from the Digambra tradition,

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:90%
which we mentioned is--

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.400 align:middle line:84%
you can say more of
the fundamentalist type

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.230 align:middle line:90%
of tradition of Jainism.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
thing with religion.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's not unlike
Christianity, where

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.726 align:middle line:84%
you have different sects that
believe in different things.

00:31:23.726 --> 00:31:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're all filtering
the truth in their own way.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.850 align:middle line:84%
All religion is fraught
with cultural issues.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen those play a
role in so many different forms

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:90%
of religion.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So the Digambras
believed that only men

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:84%
could become liberated, and
you had to be in male form.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is very
curious, because actually,

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.140 align:middle line:10%
one of the tirthankaras--

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.514 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned there
are 24 of them.

00:31:45.514 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:10%
So they're like 24 jinas,
who are like the bodhisattvas

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.150 align:middle line:10%
for Buddhism.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.630 align:middle line:10%
One of them was female.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:10%
The 19th tirthankara was
actually named Mallinatha.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:10%
And there is actually
historical evidence

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.200 align:middle line:10%
that suggests that she was
a female, because they have

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:10%
excavated idols, for
example, from 15 years ago

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.440 align:middle line:10%
that show very clearly she
had braids, she had breaths.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet the Digambras
hold that she wasn't

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.160 align:middle line:90%
a female, that she was a male.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.600 align:middle line:90%
So that's one sect.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
one, Svetambaras Jains,

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.970 align:middle line:84%
which I'm a part of-- and there
are many different sub-sects

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:90%
between them--

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:90%
they don't believe that.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:10%
And actually,
Mahavira, who again

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.820 align:middle line:10%
was considered the
modern founder of Jainism

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.560 align:middle line:10%
in the sixth century
BCE, was actually

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.990 align:middle line:10%
known as a liberator of women.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Because he was
the one that said,

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.660 align:middle line:90%
actually, that's not true.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Women can attain liberation.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Women are equal to men, and
they are embodied human form,

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and there's no reason why they
can't attain enlightenment.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But there is some
confusion around that.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There is.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating,
because you

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:84%
look at the psychology behind
it and say, well, first of all,

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.740 align:middle line:84%
being able to be naked
in front of the world,

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.310 align:middle line:84%
in front of yourself, the
soul, and so forth, and express

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:90%
yourself, is--

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:84%
it's not an undesirable thing to
do, to attain this liberation,

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.150 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be
naked in the world.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet if a woman is
naked in the world,

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:84%
it can tempt the man, who is
on his path of purification.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: And then
there's this projection

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.040 align:middle line:90%
that the woman is evil.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then there's
this projection

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.114 align:middle line:84%
that the woman is evil, so
that's one of the reasons.

00:33:12.114 --> 00:33:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Yeah, that's
one of the reasons.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And it plagues, I think,
many societies, certainly

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.170 align:middle line:90%
the Vedic society.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I'll just share with
you an anecdote.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.600 align:middle line:10%
My husband, who is an Indian
man like me, born and raised

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:10%
in the States,
was very connected

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.860 align:middle line:10%
to Vivekananda
and his teachings.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:10%
And so I knew that he
was very connected to it.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.940 align:middle line:10%
So when we were
married, I picked up

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.064 align:middle line:10%
one of Vivekananda's books.

00:33:32.064 --> 00:33:33.310 align:middle line:90%
He has a whole set of them.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I just opened to something
and started reading it.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was the woman
this, the woman that,

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.390 align:middle line:84%
like totally disparaging, almost
like the woman who was evil.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.730 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what is this?

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a discussion
with him about it.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
that was the culture

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720 align:middle line:90%
that he was coming from.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's
fine, but he's

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.170 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be enlightened.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.450 align:middle line:90%
So how does that work?

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we see this plaguing
and this suppression

00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:84%
of feminine wisdom and this
projection of impulse control

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:04.180 align:middle line:84%
issues onto the woman
all over society today.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Now we see this kind of uprising
in our society, of course,

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.739 align:middle line:84%
of the Me Too movement
and other things.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're seeing an
uprising in that movement

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.352 align:middle line:90%
in science today, too.

00:34:12.352 --> 00:34:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where the
study of the biofield comes in.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:19.659 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think about what
that is, it's the vital bodies.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So in the Vedic traditions,
there's an understanding

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.969 align:middle line:84%
that divine union of
the male and female

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:28.929 align:middle line:84%
are Shakti and Shiva, Shakti
being the divine female force,

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the vitalism that
runs through the body that

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.250 align:middle line:84%
meets the wisdom that is
inherent to really create

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.830 align:middle line:90%
utmost consciousness and bliss.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And so what have we done?

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.710 align:middle line:84%
We've taken the divine
feminine out of everything,

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.630 align:middle line:90%
including science.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:90%
And so we don't have wisdom.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.741 align:middle line:90%
We just accumulate knowledge.

00:34:47.741 --> 00:34:49.949 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I couldn't
agree with you more on that.

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
women do not have

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.253 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate as male
first before they

00:34:54.253 --> 00:34:55.419 align:middle line:90%
can attain their liberation.

00:34:55.419 --> 00:34:55.719 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: No.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.400 align:middle line:84%
That's only in the
Digambara sect.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's definitely
hotly debated among Jains.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And I would say all of
the Svetambara sects--

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and there are
about five of them,

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I think, or something--
don't believe that.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.650 align:middle line:84%
They do believe that women
can absolutely be liberated.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.347 align:middle line:84%
And one of our
tirthankaras was a woman.

00:35:12.347 --> 00:35:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What you were just
talking about a moment ago,

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.350 align:middle line:84%
even in the world of science,
the smearing of the two--

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking at a conference
a few ago, several months ago

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end, they had
each of the speakers on stage.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.200 align:middle line:90%
We were all in a panel together.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.756 align:middle line:84%
And they were each
to make a statement

00:35:29.756 --> 00:35:31.380 align:middle line:84%
or answer a question
from the audience.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things--

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:90%
I made a statement.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
interesting to watch.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I said, until
we marry the intuitive

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and the native
wisdom of our ability

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:84%
to bring through information
from other realms

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:84%
with this wonderful scientific
knowledge in the world

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.237 align:middle line:84%
of material sciences--
until we marry them,

00:35:54.237 --> 00:35:55.820 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
make any fast track

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:84%
to any of these
major discoveries

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that this conference
is all about.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:59.772 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: That's great.

00:35:59.772 --> 00:36:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And actually, I have
to say the men were really--

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:03.271 align:middle line:90%
they were all scientists.

00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:06.730 align:middle line:84%
The men were very uncomfortable
with it, mostly arms folded.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Audience loved it.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:08.920 align:middle line:90%
They were like yes.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:90%
They were applauding.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they could
understand it's true.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.995 align:middle line:84%
The time has come
to be able to--

00:36:14.995 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and we could go down
many tracks with this,

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:84%
but to bring that
feminine aspect of being,

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
which is the part that can very
easily detach from the material

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.210 align:middle line:84%
world and bring knowledge
in from other areas.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Men and women can do it.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just the feminine
receptive aspect of being.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Until we're fully charging
that up and using it

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.030 align:middle line:84%
alongside science,
we aren't going

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:90%
to make a lot of progress.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too slow.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Exactly.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:41.430 align:middle line:90%
It's too slow.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:44.980 align:middle line:10%
So I study with-- my teacher
is Reverend Rosalyn Bruyere.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.560 align:middle line:10%
And so she is part of our
scientific advisory council,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:10%
actually, among many
healers who are also

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.878 align:middle line:10%
part of our
collaborative, I think,

00:36:50.878 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:10%
who have been on your show,
Tiffany Barsotti, Eileen

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.441 align:middle line:10%
McKusick, and others.

00:36:54.441 --> 00:36:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
Rosalyn remarked about

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.856 align:middle line:84%
that she loves with getting
together with other scientists

00:36:58.856 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:90%
is that our biofields--

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.990 align:middle line:90%
they merge.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:03.730 align:middle line:90%
So our biofields merge.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And so she gets to gain that
analytical understanding

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.889 align:middle line:84%
that they have, and they get
to expand their consciousness

00:37:10.889 --> 00:37:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and worldview in a way that's
more receptive to getting

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.857 align:middle line:84%
answers that are not just
from their thinking mind.

00:37:15.857 --> 00:37:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that we're doing,

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.900 align:middle line:84%
actually, is we're taking
a delegation of scientists

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to India this year
to sit with some

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.730 align:middle line:84%
of the great spiritual
teachers and leaders

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.455 align:middle line:84%
and really go to their
space, go to their church.

00:37:27.455 --> 00:37:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So again, instead of
bringing them here

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and coming to the university
and all that-- that's great.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:32.290 align:middle line:90%
They're happy to do it.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:33.670 align:middle line:84%
As you know, many of
these spiritual leaders

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:35.260 align:middle line:90%
love to meet with scientists.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's also
important that we go there,

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:42.220 align:middle line:84%
that we feel the vibrations of
their ashrams, their devotees,

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.234 align:middle line:84%
their experience, and open
ourselves to the nonlinearity

00:37:45.234 --> 00:37:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that exists-- of course,
as you know in India,

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:90%
it's very nonlinear there--

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:84%
so that we can ask
better questions.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into
the actual tenants

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.820 align:middle line:90%
of Indo-Tibetan healing.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.400 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean, and what
are the tenants of healing,

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.584 align:middle line:90%
and how does it differ?

00:37:59.584 --> 00:38:01.750 align:middle line:84%
If you have this chart where
the soul is essentially

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:84%
at the center, I would assume
that the process of healing

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it begs the question
of what is healing, actually.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has a
different definition.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.300 align:middle line:90%
And I think all of us--

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Balancing
out imbalances.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:14.908 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Right, exactly.

00:38:14.908 --> 00:38:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone, probably,
who is watching agrees

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.815 align:middle line:90%
that healing is not caring.

00:38:20.815 --> 00:38:22.898 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you have to
do a lot of clarification

00:38:22.898 --> 00:38:24.310 align:middle line:84%
on that for our
medical audiences

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:25.512 align:middle line:90%
and scientific audiences.

00:38:25.512 --> 00:38:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not about just getting
rid of a disease or getting rid

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.460 align:middle line:84%
of something that's in me
that I don't want anymore.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.750 align:middle line:90%
That might happen.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.100 align:middle line:90%
That might not happen.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:37.090 align:middle line:84%
for me, healing is bringing
one closer to their own soul

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.500 align:middle line:90%
and their soul nature.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
is what is reflected

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.370 align:middle line:90%
in these Indic practices.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So going back to that
framework of the soul

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:84%
really being the
ultimate goal, if we

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:84%
are in harmony with
our soul's actions

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and our soul's manifestation
in physical form,

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:84%
then we understand that
we are vibratory, alive,

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
dynamic beings that
are interacting

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:04.150 align:middle line:84%
with the world in all
of these different ways.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:08.367 align:middle line:84%
Now, from the Indic traditions,
there is speaking of elements.

00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the different traditions,
it's kind of different.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, we
are all comprised--

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
everything in nature,
including ourselves, are

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.990 align:middle line:90%
comprised of these elements.

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:25.070 align:middle line:84%
In our tradition, it's space,
earth, water, fire, and air.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.131 align:middle line:84%
So we all have this
unique cosmic blueprint.

00:39:28.131 --> 00:39:29.380 align:middle line:90%
That's essentially what it is.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.460 align:middle line:90%
It's based on karma.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.400 align:middle line:84%
It's based on what we've done
before in previous lives, what

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.950 align:middle line:84%
we're up to now, what
our sole purpose is.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:84%
We've been constructed in a
way to carry out our purpose.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And our constitution
really reflects that.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So healing is really about
getting us to be back

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:46.420 align:middle line:90%
to our best vibratory selves.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And so healing for me might look
different from healing for you.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.540 align:middle line:84%
The commonality is that
it's bringing us back

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.620 align:middle line:84%
to our soul nature and
our soul in physical form.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes, again,
with the plaguing of dualism

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.120 align:middle line:84%
that we have-- and
honestly, in some ways,

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Jainism also dualistic
in the way it describes

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:90%
the soul and the body.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.950 align:middle line:84%
We're learning more and
more that the power that we

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:84%
have here as embodied souls on
this Earth to affect healing

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:84%
requires us to be fully awake
and present in our bodies

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.200 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I see
an evolution happening

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.420 align:middle line:84%
in some of the ways
that we're interpreting

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.800 align:middle line:90%
some of these texts.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.830 align:middle line:10%
So maybe you and some of
your viewers, for example,

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.470 align:middle line:10%
have heard of Sri
Aurobindo and the mother.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.350 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely brilliant,
brilliant man, brilliant woman.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:37.150 align:middle line:10%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.030 align:middle line:10%
And the mother
appeared very clear

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.750 align:middle line:10%
in her speaking and
her writing that--

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.730 align:middle line:10%
and this is completely aligned
with Jan wisdom, Vedic wisdom--

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:49.480 align:middle line:10%
that consciousness is all the
way down to the cellular level.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Our cells are conscious.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we have the potential at
this point of not just checking

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.050 align:middle line:84%
out to go get wisdom,
go somewhere else,

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.180 align:middle line:84%
or just leave somewhere
else, and liberate.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.819 align:middle line:84%
Certainly we can
follow that model.

00:41:02.819 --> 00:41:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But if we choose that we don't
want to do that at this point,

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:84%
we also have the capacity
to bring forth wisdom

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.520 align:middle line:90%
to provide heaven on Earth.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.950 align:middle line:84%
We have that capability to
provide heaven on Earth,

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.440 align:middle line:84%
to bring healing in
through ourselves,

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.100 align:middle line:84%
outside of ourselves, to bring
greater light to everything

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.090 align:middle line:90%
that is manifest on this Earth.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that
has to do with working

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.920 align:middle line:84%
with these elemental
energies, bringing them

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
from a more gross level to a
finer and finer state, right?

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.145 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
the healing process.

00:41:35.145 --> 00:41:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's not relegated to
Indo-Tibetan practices at all.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.405 align:middle line:90%
That's in native practices.

00:41:39.405 --> 00:41:41.510 align:middle line:84%
It's in all of these
different practices.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And Rosalyn has
certainly taught me

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot about how to feel
the subtle elements

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and how to utilize
those for healing.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So very specific ways
that you can do that.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.380 align:middle line:84%
But the first part, I'd
say, is just to tune

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:56.530 align:middle line:90%
in to one's own sensation.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.001 align:middle line:90%
Notice what's there.

00:41:58.001 --> 00:41:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
know that elements

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:84%
are related to
chakras, and there

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:03.010 align:middle line:90%
are different models for that.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But for example, if one is
feeling emotionally depleted,

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Rosalyn is fond of saying
the solution to pollution

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:90%
is dilution.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Bring water into
the second chakra.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Help flush it.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:90%
Help clear it.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:19.530 align:middle line:84%
The first chakra in the
Vedic model is earth.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:90%
In Rosalyn's model, it's fire.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:90%
You can see how it's both.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Grounding, connecting
with the earth

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.980 align:middle line:90%
is vitally important for us.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.688 align:middle line:84%
If we're really going
to be able to bring

00:42:28.688 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual all the way
down into the physical

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.070 align:middle line:84%
into our bodies
and on the Earth,

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:36.840 align:middle line:84%
we can utilize the power
of these elements subtly

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.640 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's a really fun process.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
there's another part.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the notes
I made here-- it's

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.760 align:middle line:84%
the interaction of
our environment,

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.500 align:middle line:84%
any subtle energies, is creating
psychological reactions, right?

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.430 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
are mentioned here

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.640 align:middle line:84%
are attachment, aversion,
and indifference,

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.870 align:middle line:84%
which is also attraction and
repulsion and essentially

00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:59.870 align:middle line:90%
indifference, right?

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.277 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really the flow
of energy through our egos.

00:43:03.277 --> 00:43:04.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just really our
ego conditioning.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.901 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's really
where a lot of people

00:43:06.901 --> 00:43:09.650 align:middle line:84%
get hung up, so
let's talk about it.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Life, all of life, is based
on attraction and repulsion.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the nature of
the universe itself.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:17.032 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Well, it can be, sure.

00:43:17.032 --> 00:43:18.490 align:middle line:84%
That is the nature
of the universe.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:19.969 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just on
an atomic level.

00:43:19.969 --> 00:43:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yes, that's true.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:22.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the law of
cause and effect.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:26.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the duality that
we live in, absolutely.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think the skill that
a lot of these religious and

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.120 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions
are trying to help us

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.610 align:middle line:84%
with is the ability
to observe that

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.440 align:middle line:90%
without getting caught into it.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:90%
So we're human beings.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:90%
We want for things.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:40.826 align:middle line:90%
We avoid certain things.

00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But is there a way that
we can lean into that

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and actually observe
that wanting, observe

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that repulsion in a way that
we're not consumed by it?

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Because it's when we
get consumed by it

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.090 align:middle line:90%
that we run into problems.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.790 align:middle line:84%
It's when I'm so
attached to something

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that I can't see
everything else around me.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Either way creates a
lot of resistance in our lives.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Whether something is being
taken away or foisted upon us,

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:07.300 align:middle line:84%
there's resistance either way
if we have too strong a vantage

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.870 align:middle line:90%
point or a viewpoint, right?

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, what that does
is those strong attachments

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and aversions create
karma-- again,

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:84%
going back to that
karmic sheath,

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.020 align:middle line:84%
you're literally creating
more subtle matter that

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.450 align:middle line:90%
obscures the light of the soul.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So yes, attachment and
aversion are part of life.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.400 align:middle line:90%
But the trick is--

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.420 align:middle line:90%
there's a trick.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.600 align:middle line:84%
The trick is really to
watch it so that you're not

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.190 align:middle line:84%
attached to your
attachment, you're

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.140 align:middle line:90%
not attached to your aversion.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So then the light of the soul
is able to shine through more

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.340 align:middle line:84%
clearly and guide you
on your purpose in life.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems to me
actually quite simple in that

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.150 align:middle line:84%
if you are able to listen
to these subtle feelings--

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:50.680 align:middle line:84%
as I call them, the
whisperings of the soul--

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that you tread through
life a little more lightly.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And you allow yourself, whether
it's your preference or not

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.620 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, to
be guided where

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:00.940 align:middle line:90%
you need to go in that moment.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
a lot of people,

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.450 align:middle line:84%
especially in a very
willful world, get hung up.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Once a desire is created
for a specific outcome,

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.945 align:middle line:90%
then comes the attachment.

00:45:11.945 --> 00:45:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we're
doing it because we

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:18.550 align:middle line:84%
think we're supposed to, because
there's some societal pressure

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.350 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.370 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
it's driven by that

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:25.090 align:middle line:84%
or just garden variety
attractions and repulsions.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:32.260 align:middle line:84%
But to me, if you can't just
listen and respond accordingly,

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.200 align:middle line:84%
life becomes nothing
but resistance.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So how can you avoid building
up more of this subtle matter

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.170 align:middle line:90%
called karma?

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I think a key thing is really
widening our perspectives.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.920 align:middle line:84%
We live in an increasingly
self-referential world.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.110 align:middle line:90%
We have our social media.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.597 align:middle line:90%
We have all of these things.

00:45:51.597 --> 00:45:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And now we get self-referential
about our purpose.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.929 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, what's my purpose?

00:45:54.929 --> 00:45:57.100 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's really
getting boring.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Yeah, it can
get really boring,

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.780 align:middle line:90%
because it's lonely too.

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So when we widen our
perspective while doing

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.070 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of
spiritual practices

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that connect us both to
spirit and with each other,

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.260 align:middle line:90%
we widen our lens.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't take
things as seriously.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We're able to watch and
observe, and like you said,

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:23.320 align:middle line:84%
be light with the process,
have fun with the process,

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.720 align:middle line:90%
and let go of our rigidity.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.310 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One time a being that
I'm closely associated with

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.010 align:middle line:84%
that I chat with
from time to time--

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:37.420 align:middle line:84%
the being was saying that
the conscious mind as we

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.680 align:middle line:84%
know it, the animal portion
of the conscious mind,

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.300 align:middle line:84%
they say it was initially
only there to keep you

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.210 align:middle line:90%
from bumping into things.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:50.260 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the part that
was taken over, dominated,

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:54.070 align:middle line:84%
making your life decisions
for you now to the point where

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:56.590 align:middle line:84%
essentially, you can't even
hear the real mind, which

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:58.450 align:middle line:90%
is the whispering of the soul.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I assume that part of
the practice, the practice

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.010 align:middle line:84%
element of the
Jan tradition, has

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to be removing the
noise so that you

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.170 align:middle line:84%
can hear the soul or the higher
mind speak through to you.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely, yeah.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then get this
lower mind that's chatting

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.280 align:middle line:84%
away, telling us what we
should and shouldn't do,

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and holds shame-- that's
subconscious-- but nonetheless,

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.740 align:middle line:90%
all of this baggage with it--

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.910 align:middle line:84%
it really has to
take a backseat.

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.190 align:middle line:84%
That is what's causing
the problem in us.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet we all have
to deal with it.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.586 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah, it's really true.

00:47:33.586 --> 00:47:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And these tried and true
spiritual practices really

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.370 align:middle line:84%
help us to filter
out that mind noise

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:42.730 align:middle line:84%
to clarify a direct channel
with our spirit guides,

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.230 align:middle line:90%
with our souls.

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Jan
tradition, that's

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.130 align:middle line:84%
generally taken in the
form of mantra meditations.

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot
of mantric prayers

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that we do that help to
stabilize the energy field.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.440 align:middle line:84%
There are color
meditations as well

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to bring in color into the
body, again with verbalizations

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.750 align:middle line:90%
of mantras to do that.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely
that tradition,

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.410 align:middle line:84%
very similar to
Vedic traditions,

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.390 align:middle line:84%
the traditions of really
getting into the body

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.760 align:middle line:84%
and relaxing every
single part of the body.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we understand
that all the impulses that

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.730 align:middle line:84%
are going on here are
mental emotional, basically.

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's happening
is here reflected in the body.

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And so by getting
the body quiet,

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:84%
we help get the mind quiet,
and we allow for spirit

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.480 align:middle line:84%
to come more fully
present in our bodies.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And these are universal.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I just had the beauty of
sitting with a Chilean healer.

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:35.780 align:middle line:90%
It was just amazing.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It was this past week.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
similarities in all

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:42.370 align:middle line:84%
of these indigenous approaches
and Christian approaches,

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:44.830 align:middle line:90%
all of these different--

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Judaism, even, I would
say to a degree, probably

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Islam and others--

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.520 align:middle line:84%
there's always a reminder to
refocus back on sensation,

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.270 align:middle line:90%
to anchor back into the body.

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And so as we start doing
that, for if we're just

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.570 align:middle line:84%
learning about it, we start
feeling the sensations

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.160 align:middle line:90%
associated with our emotions.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we start learning
about the thoughts that are

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:06.701 align:middle line:90%
associated with those emotions.

00:49:06.701 --> 00:49:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And then once we've
cleared the bubbling river,

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting more
to lake level, stillness

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:16.290 align:middle line:84%
of the ripples of
sensation in our body,

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:18.430 align:middle line:84%
then we get into the
more subtle aspects.

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And the subtle sensations
give us spiritual messages.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once
we begin to quiet it

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.890 align:middle line:84%
all down so we can
actually listen,

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:32.690 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
pops up is trauma.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And we have to somehow
interface with that trauma.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.230 align:middle line:10%
And this is something
in Tiffany's work,

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:40.060 align:middle line:10%
Eileen McKusick's work.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.970 align:middle line:10%
When she's using
her tuning processes

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:45.210 align:middle line:10%
to go through the subtle
layers of our history,

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.130 align:middle line:10%
you keep hitting trauma,
disturbances in the field,

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:49.510 align:middle line:10%
another disturbance
in the field.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.490 align:middle line:10%
And then on the other
side of the body,

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.700 align:middle line:10%
she looks at how this is
expressed out in our behavior

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.850 align:middle line:10%
at this point in time
and into the future.

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.210 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So looking at it from
that point of view,

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.140 align:middle line:90%
how is trauma worked with?

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar to these
other healing approaches

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.600 align:middle line:84%
in that as you clarify
the light of the soul,

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.810 align:middle line:84%
you gain the power to release
those karmic patterns that

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:19.280 align:middle line:84%
stay in the biofield and keep
that trauma pattern running.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a karmic
trace of that trauma, which

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:23.620 align:middle line:90%
often there is--

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.600 align:middle line:90%
trauma runs deep.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It's usually felt
on a karmic level.

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:31.330 align:middle line:84%
As we go through the processes
of spiritual awakening,

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.760 align:middle line:84%
spiritual liberation,
a lot of those traumas

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.170 align:middle line:84%
will come to light
when they seek

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:39.014 align:middle line:84%
help with them, like going
to a healer, for example,

00:50:39.014 --> 00:50:40.555 align:middle line:84%
or going to a
spiritual practitioner,

00:50:40.555 --> 00:50:43.105 align:middle line:84%
or going to friends,
sharing what's

00:50:43.105 --> 00:50:44.230 align:middle line:90%
coming up for me right now.

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:45.438 align:middle line:90%
It could be past life trauma.

00:50:45.438 --> 00:50:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It could be a lot
of different things.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.110 align:middle line:84%
By clarifying the
light of the soul,

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:51.850 align:middle line:84%
we're able to release
those patterns.

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And once we release those
patterns on the karmic level,

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:58.210 align:middle line:84%
they no longer plague
our mind and our emotions

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and our behaviors in the
way that they had before.

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:04.140 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, as you know,
when you do deep work,

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:05.890 align:middle line:84%
you don't even know
it's going to come up.

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:07.431 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
there's a trauma

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:10.300 align:middle line:84%
that comes up that you
weren't even aware of before.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And it can come up in layers.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when I think of the
trauma that's carried forward

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:22.180 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime and from other
lifetimes, in my vernacular,

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:25.060 align:middle line:84%
that would be contained within
what we call the subconscious.

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So how does the word
"karma" and this karmic body

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:84%
interface with the notion,
or maybe the Western notion,

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.090 align:middle line:90%
of the subconscious mind?

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, recall that we talked
about these emanations

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:39.190 align:middle line:90%
of karma.

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:42.680 align:middle line:84%
In the Jan tradition, they
describe them as twofold.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.640 align:middle line:84%
One is psychical, meaning
the mind and emotions,

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.270 align:middle line:90%
and one is physical.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So we can see how the
emanations of consciousness

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and our conscious experience get
lodged into our bodies as well

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.930 align:middle line:90%
as our mind and emotions.

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:59.830 align:middle line:84%
So that is the adivasi,
or the karmic emanations

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:01.390 align:middle line:90%
that spring forth.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Those are not always conscious.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:04.600 align:middle line:90%
But what I've noticed--

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and likely, I think, all
healers and practitioners

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.880 align:middle line:84%
have noticed-- is
that even when they're

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.760 align:middle line:84%
lodged in the subconscious, they
play a role in our behavior.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:15.730 align:middle line:84%
They're driving
behavior unconsciously.

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So we just simply start
looking at our behavior

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.640 align:middle line:84%
patterns, especially the things
that aren't working for us

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.723 align:middle line:84%
and things that are causing
us pain and suffering,

00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and we say what
is going on here.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Why is this pattern continuing
to come forth in my life?

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And how can I look
deeply into that?

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we don't
know the origin of it.

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:84%
There are some
healers, including

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.874 align:middle line:84%
Rosalyn, who believe that you
don't have to know everything

00:52:37.874 --> 00:52:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was going to ask next.

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:40.590 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that--
we have a little bit of time

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:43.960 align:middle line:90%
here--

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.250 align:middle line:84%
about the two different
schools of thought.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.170 align:middle line:90%
You have to get to it.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:48.130 align:middle line:90%
You have to relive it.

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:50.050 align:middle line:84%
You get in the pain,
and boom, that's

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:52.240 align:middle line:84%
going to somehow
disperse it, right?

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: No.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is an
understanding among many of us

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.050 align:middle line:90%
that if a healer--

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:03.390 align:middle line:84%
let's say if a healer does not
know how to skillfully remove

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:05.710 align:middle line:84%
a trauma at the
karmic level, they

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:07.360 align:middle line:90%
may actually just basically--

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Re-traumatized.

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Yeah, you just amplified
the traumatic pattern, which

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.590 align:middle line:84%
might serve if someone
really needs to wake up

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.600 align:middle line:84%
to their traumatic
pattern, but it may cause

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.550 align:middle line:90%
a lot of suffering as well.

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:20.500 align:middle line:90%
So I personally think--

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.514 align:middle line:90%
this is on a case-by-case basis.

00:53:23.514 --> 00:53:25.180 align:middle line:84%
For me, one of the
most important things

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.805 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned
personally in working

00:53:26.805 --> 00:53:29.500 align:middle line:84%
with trauma with patients
with PTSD and others

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.870 align:middle line:90%
is that you create a container.

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Creating a container for
me has worked really well.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So you really create
a space of light

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that allows that karmic
trace to release.

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who have helped
people release their trauma

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.020 align:middle line:90%
have seen that.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:48.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a flash, and it comes
often with a flash of insight.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It comes with an energetic
feeling of something

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.450 align:middle line:90%
leaving the body.

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.877 align:middle line:84%
But if you're trying to
dig in there and get it--

00:53:54.877 --> 00:53:55.960 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of like you're--

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give it a
name, give it a face.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that it's always
so helpful, unless the person is

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.470 align:middle line:84%
coming where they're present and
they need to talk it through.

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And we see this a lot, even
in chronic pain-- for example,

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.970 align:middle line:84%
a lot of work I've
done with veterans.

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Of course they
always send veterans

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.440 align:middle line:84%
to the psychologist when they're
using up too many services,

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.794 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to get
them to utilize less services,

00:54:13.794 --> 00:54:15.710 align:middle line:84%
so they send them to the
psychologist instead.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
how they're stuck

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:20.290 align:middle line:84%
in their narrative of trauma
that's not necessarily

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.520 align:middle line:90%
helping them move forward.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you able to, in
that practice with veterans,

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:84%
utilize some of your more
ancient and mystical knowledge

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.410 align:middle line:90%
to work with them?

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah, of course.

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:32.801 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or do you
have to do it covertly?

00:54:32.801 --> 00:54:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: So I'll share with
you on a personal level,

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I never sat for my licensure.

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And I did that on
purpose-- because I

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.940 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be
constrained and feel

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.080 align:middle line:84%
like, as a clinical
psychologist,

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not allowed to touch people.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.512 align:middle line:84%
And quite frankly, most
of my full-time work

00:54:47.512 --> 00:54:49.720 align:middle line:84%
is really being done in the
Consciousness and Healing

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Initiative and directing that.

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But when I work with someone who
has trauma like this, generally

00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:02.920 align:middle line:84%
speaking, it D depending
on what their openness is,

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.260 align:middle line:90%
we may talk about it.

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's, as you know,
kind of a felt thing.

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Their guides come in.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:09.820 align:middle line:90%
My guides come in.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I may intend to just hold
them in a pillar of light.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.955 align:middle line:90%
And that has worked really well.

00:55:14.955 --> 00:55:17.080 align:middle line:10%
You think about-- I don't
want to digress too much,

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.180 align:middle line:10%
but you think about
the work of Carl Rogers

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.680 align:middle line:10%
and that famous,
famous session he

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.940 align:middle line:10%
had where he sat in
silence with his patient,

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.790 align:middle line:10%
and this patient had an
enormous breakthrough.

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:29.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: And the psychologists
were like, what happened?

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And the healers understand
it all too well.

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
years ago, I used

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:41.560 align:middle line:84%
to do just a little clinical
hypnotherapy practice I had.

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.524 align:middle line:90%
And I was not a psychologist.

00:55:43.524 --> 00:55:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I just understood the
skill set and went

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:46.510 align:middle line:84%
through that kind
of certification.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:47.510 align:middle line:90%
You can do it in months.

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal right.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.157 align:middle line:84%
Psychologists will say,
oh, my god, don't do that.

00:55:52.157 --> 00:55:53.990 align:middle line:84%
But I always found it
was quite interesting.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:57.790 align:middle line:84%
I had some good success with
people doing this in the day.

00:55:57.790 --> 00:56:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I found
that was not taught--

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and I can't say that my
instructor particularly

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.810 align:middle line:84%
frowned on it, but
they didn't understand

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:11.650 align:middle line:84%
it-- was that I started
doing silent sessions,

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:14.650 align:middle line:84%
connecting with people in
their ideomotor response

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.600 align:middle line:90%
silently, mind to mind.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And as long as there was
an environment of trust,

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:21.100 align:middle line:90%
you could do this easily.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And had sometimes some really
profound transformations,

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.520 align:middle line:84%
especially when I was
working with someone where

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.150 align:middle line:90%
it was performance-oriented.

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I would get an agreement
with them, mind to mind,

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and they would just boom,
pop up in the competition

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and not know what they had
done or been working on.

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But I find that that's
actually a very powerful way

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.890 align:middle line:84%
to work because it bypasses
all resistance-- the resistance

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:47.270 align:middle line:84%
of all words, all
concepts, all ego.

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:48.254 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there--

00:56:48.254 --> 00:56:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Holding space.

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Except a pure holding
space for another person.

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:52.270 align:middle line:90%
It was very effective.

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:53.311 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: That's wonderful.

00:56:53.311 --> 00:56:55.360 align:middle line:84%
There's one other thing
that comes to mind since

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.943 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about how to work
with trauma that we've learned

00:56:57.943 --> 00:57:01.090 align:middle line:84%
from Rosalyn and that many
healers are using today with

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:03.010 align:middle line:84%
their work in with
PTSD patients,

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and that is actually
rooted in Vedic tradition--

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:06.644 align:middle line:84%
it's probably other
traditions as well,

00:57:06.644 --> 00:57:08.830 align:middle line:84%
I think Egyptian
traditions and others--

00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:10.720 align:middle line:90%
called unwinding.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is understood to really
help release patterns that

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:16.190 align:middle line:90%
again are on the karmic level.

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So what it might look like is,
for example, a patient laying

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.400 align:middle line:84%
on the table-- not
always, but can

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.010 align:middle line:84%
look like this, where you have
your hands around their head.

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And again, you're holding space.

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And their bodies start
to move a little bit.

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Their head starts to move.

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the
pattern releasing.

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.700 align:middle line:84%
There are meditations that one
can do, unwinding meditations,

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.075 align:middle line:84%
that are just good
because we all

00:57:38.075 --> 00:57:40.580 align:middle line:84%
get wound up in our little
patterns and things like that.

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really
easy self-care practice

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:45.430 align:middle line:90%
where one sits in meditation.

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And it allows the body
to move freely in the way

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.140 align:middle line:84%
that it wants to release those
patterns that are winding us

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:51.940 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:53.336 align:middle line:90%
So be specific.

00:57:53.336 --> 00:57:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Is that all there is to it?

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:55.891 align:middle line:90%
You sit quietly.

00:57:55.891 --> 00:57:56.890 align:middle line:90%
You're feeling wound up.

00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.990 align:middle line:84%
You sit quietly,
and you just allow

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:01.360 align:middle line:84%
the body, of its
own intelligence,

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:04.296 align:middle line:84%
to begin moving you,
just subtle movement?

00:58:04.296 --> 00:58:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: I would add--

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I always think this
is a good practice,

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.280 align:middle line:84%
especially in this day and age
-- make sure you're grounded.

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.715 align:middle line:90%
So sit down, stand up, whatever.

00:58:11.715 --> 00:58:12.515 align:middle line:10%
Sitting is easier.

00:58:12.515 --> 00:58:13.315 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Breathe.

00:58:13.315 --> 00:58:16.000 align:middle line:10%
>>JAIN: Breathe, feel
the base of your spine,

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.330 align:middle line:10%
feel your feet on the ground,
feel your legs connect

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:21.250 align:middle line:10%
with the earth, feel
supported by the earth,

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:24.580 align:middle line:10%
support yourself, and send
support back down to the earth

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:27.390 align:middle line:10%
so you really have that firm
connection with the earth.

00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then let
the movement just--

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: And then let
the movement begin.

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So that way you don't get dizzy
or feel a little lightheaded

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:34.600 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:35.860 align:middle line:90%
You're really grounded.

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And this process
can be five minutes.

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.330 align:middle line:90%
It can be 45 minutes.

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I think Rosalyn and
Ken recommend doing it

00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:44.110 align:middle line:90%
about twice a week if you can.

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I found it to be very helpful.

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've done
it just spontaneously

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:48.200 align:middle line:90%
off and on throughout my life.

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know exactly
what was going on,

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.803 align:middle line:84%
except I assumed it was
working through something.

00:58:51.803 --> 00:58:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I find it very
natural and beautiful.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Give us maybe-- we just have
a couple of minutes left--

00:58:56.750 --> 00:59:01.240 align:middle line:84%
maybe one little Jain meditation
or a prayer, or something

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.994 align:middle line:90%
universal that we can work with.

00:59:02.994 --> 00:59:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: I'd love to do that.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:07.627 align:middle line:84%
So I'll share with you
a Jan universal prayer,

00:59:07.627 --> 00:59:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'll explain a
little bit of the meaning

00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:13.510 align:middle line:84%
before I say the words, which
of course are in Sanskrit.

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So the prayer is a universal
prayer for everyone.

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:19.230 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, Jainism doesn't
believe in a creator god.

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:20.770 align:middle line:84%
This is really a
universal prayer

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:23.320 align:middle line:84%
to all beings who have
attained enlightenment

00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.120 align:middle line:84%
or are teaching the
path of enlightenment

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.400 align:middle line:90%
and giving reverence to them.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.740 align:middle line:90%
So the prayer starts--

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll first say it,
and then if it's OK,

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll just sing it, because
that's how we usually do it.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So the prayer is Namo
arihantanam which means I bow

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:40.390 align:middle line:84%
to all the [NON-ENGLISH],, those
who have conquered themselves,

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:44.160 align:middle line:84%
those who have stayed to teach
the way of enlightenment.

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.060 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I bow to all those who have
attained enlightenment.

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:51.510 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I bow to all heads of
congregations that are holding

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.790 align:middle line:90%
space for this learning.

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:59.530 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I bow, again, to some of the
major monks and nuns that

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.288 align:middle line:90%
are teaching the way.

01:00:06.288 --> 01:00:11.910 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] I bow to all
teachers of spirituality.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:14.090 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:19.520 align:middle line:84%
By bowing to these five
beings, [NON-ENGLISH],,

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.560 align:middle line:90%
may all darkness be removed.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.970 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH] basically
means this is a very revered,

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.020 align:middle line:10%
ancient prayer.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.102 align:middle line:10%
So we will sing it now,
or I'll sing it for you.

01:00:33.102 --> 01:00:34.560 align:middle line:10%
I sing this to my
kids every night.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.864 align:middle line:10%
You'll love it.

01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:38.696 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

01:00:38.696 --> 01:02:09.460 align:middle line:90%


01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.250 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH]

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:12.050 align:middle line:90%


01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:13.520 align:middle line:90%
May all beings have peace.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.100 align:middle line:90%


01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very beautiful.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure your children will
sing that to their children.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:21.645 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Thank you.

01:02:21.645 --> 01:02:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note,
thank you so much, Shamini.

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Thank you, Regina.

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:25.920 align:middle line:10%
It's my honor.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.796 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

01:02:26.796 --> 01:02:28.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To learn more
about Shamini and her work,

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.820 align:middle line:10%

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.110 align:middle line:90%
