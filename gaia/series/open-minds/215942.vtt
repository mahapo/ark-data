>>REGINA MEREDITH: Last time
I was with Elizabeth April,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:10%
we talked about
timelines according

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.660 align:middle line:10%
to the Galactic Federation.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:10%
But a lot has
happened since then.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a look at what

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:84%
the timelines for transformation
are shaping into right now

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:84%
because it feels like
we took the quick rip

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:90%
off the Band-Aid option.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, it's good
to see you again.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH APRIL: Thank you
so much for having me back.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we get
into all these timelines,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
we're kind of picking
up where we left off

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:90%
in our last conversation.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So for anyone who
hasn't seen it,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of a good
backstory to where we are now.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But let's just talk about
the Galactic Federation

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
for a moment, your own
relationship to them,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:90%
what they're made up of--

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people hear the word

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.300 align:middle line:84%
but have no real
understanding of what

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:90%
you're even talking about.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, for sure.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:10%
So I was actually pretty
upset when I first

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:10%
met the Galactic Federation.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:10%
Because at the time, I was
studying global politics.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was very disappointed
at the current structure

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.442 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even at the top
right, these non-government

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:90%
organizations are so corrupt.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when I met the Galactic
Federation for the first time,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I was really
disappointed that we even

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
needed to have a
structure in the universe.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we all just get along.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.600 align:middle line:10%
Why can't we all just
harmonize, especially

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.652 align:middle line:10%
in the higher densities
and dimensions?

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So let me
just quickly ask you.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
you were kind of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
tapped because of your
proclivity toward looking

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:90%
at things globally?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were a good tap?

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, I
mean, I was already

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:90%
disappointed with the world.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought it
was going to be better.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:90%
And there's still a hierarchy.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:90%
There's still a structure.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:90%
There's still a system.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's still a need
for an organization.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the
organization is good.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
They are here to help us
along in our ascension

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.440 align:middle line:90%
and our awakening.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
universe, there's a duality.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:90%
There's a high frequency.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:90%
There's a low frequency.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:90%
There's higher dimensions.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:90%
There's lower dimensions.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's an infinite
number of beings

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:84%
that all have different
agendas for what they want.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And so essentially, a lot of
different species got together.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And they decided that they
wanted unity in the universe.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And any other species, whether
individual or collective,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:84%
who also wanted unity
consciousness and service

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
to others decided
to get together.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is the core of
the Galactic Federation,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
is they are here to essentially
spread unity and align

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:90%
to the laws of the universe.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in your
personal connection,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:84%
how did that first
appear in your life,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.312 align:middle line:90%
your original experiences?

00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
this a little bit more,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:84%
about speaking with guides,
with other outside entities.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So how did this or these
outside entities appear to you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:90%
and show up in your life?

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:90%
So I was around 18 years old.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I was in
university at the time.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:90%
And I was in my student house.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was hanging out
with a bunch of friends.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And I started to feel really
lightheaded, really dizzy.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:90%
And so I excused myself.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:90%
And I went into my room.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I just
got to go lay down.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I went into my room, I
sat down and closed my eyes.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And as I closed my eyes, there
was this 7-foot tall being that

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
walks into my room, etheric,
not in physical body,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:84%
looking like a really
good looking man.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:90%
And he--

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of like what
we think of as Pleiadians,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, definitely
a Pleiadian man,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
about 7 feet tall, broad
shoulders, long hair.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was your very
first thought or feeling?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: My very first--

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:90%
I was very shocked.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had never
had an experience

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:84%
where I was greeted
by an astral being

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:90%
or just a being in general.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, a couple months earlier, I
was abducted for the first time.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So I was open minded
and kind of questioning

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things at the time.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.742 align:middle line:84%
And the abduction
itself was a bad one.

00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Negative beings.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I was away at a 10-day
silent meditation retreat.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And on the second
night of the retreat,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I was taken from my room
physically by the tall whites.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was very quick
abduction but very fear-based.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
They ended up implanting
something into my right ear.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And then they put
me back in my bed.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I was paralyzed still
for another about 30 minutes.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.552 align:middle line:90%
And then I was able to get up.

00:04:57.552 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was there anything
other than the insertion

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:90%
of this thing?

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Were you shown
anything, told anything?

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Nope, there
was no telepathic--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.862 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
because it was so

00:05:05.862 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:84%
lacking in empathy
and explanation

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
that it was really,
truly frightening.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, it felt
almost violating because they

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:90%
basically paralyzed my body.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:90%
My eyes were open.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.490 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I was doing
a lot of lucid dreaming

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:90%
and remote viewing.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think I was only conscious
of the experience because

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
of my prior knowledge
in lucid dreaming.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I was just more conscious, I
think, than the average person.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards,
my ear was bleeding,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
which was a good indication
or a physical indication

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:84%
that something
did indeed happen.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I went to a medical
medium shortly after that.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:90%
And I just asked her to scan me.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:90%
I actually didn't believe that--

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I kind of thought--

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I was very skeptical
about that world.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:90%
And so she scanned me.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.673 align:middle line:84%
And she says, oh, you have
an implant in your right ear.

00:05:54.673 --> 00:05:56.298 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
hadn't said anything.

00:05:56.298 --> 00:05:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So shocked,
hadn't said anything.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And she's like you were abducted
about a month ago, which

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:90%
is exactly the timing.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:84%
She was able to
dislodge the thing.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I thought she was going
to get a tool in there

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:90%
and just take it out.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But she said, I've disconnected
it from your auric field.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Still, I thought
she was kind of--

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.332 align:middle line:90%
I was skeptical.

00:06:19.332 --> 00:06:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it's just
going to leave your body.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And for about five
months afterwards, my ear

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
would drain this really
weird kind of liquid.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And she said it was made
up of organic material

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:90%
but that it was conscious.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And I actually felt
after that abduction

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:90%
that I was being tracked.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I was being monitored.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I was being watched.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what their intentions

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
were because they never
communicated that with me.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought they
were like body snatchers.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I really wasn't sure.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped all of
my spiritual practice.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I stopped getting out of
my body, remote viewing,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:90%
doing everything I was doing.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.340 align:middle line:84%
After she dislodged
it, I immediately

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
felt like I was no longer
being watched or tracked, which

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:90%
was a very beautiful feeling.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:90%
It was very freeing.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me ask you
a quick question in here

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%
before you continue on.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel as though they
were also communicating with you

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.308 align:middle line:84%
in an uninvited way, where
you would have intrusive

00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:90%
thoughts or anything like that?

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Was it that kind of implant
at all or more, say, tracking?

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, more so tracking.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And from this medical
medium's perspective,

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
she said that they
were just curious

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
because I had a higher
vibration than the other humans

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to track why
I had a higher vibration.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So it was really kind of more
scientific data analysis.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And so once that was removed,
it was another probably a month

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:90%
or two after that.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So maybe about three months
after that initial abduction

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.282 align:middle line:84%
where this being
comes into my room.

00:07:55.282 --> 00:07:56.082 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:56.082 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And like I said at
the time, I was remote viewing.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:90%
I was getting out of my body.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But I was remote
viewing planet Earth.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I was remote viewing different
scenes, different locations.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But I had never encountered
another remote viewer

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:90%
or another astral body.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So I remember sitting on
my bed and closing my eyes.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And there she was,
opening my eyes.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:90%
And he was gone.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Closing my eyes,
and he was there.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.705 align:middle line:84%
So I was really just blinking at
this higher dimensional being,

00:08:23.705 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:90%
being like, what?

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he was
an intergalactic being.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say Pleiadian.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said that there is a
meeting that I have to attend.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have to attend
consciously in two days' time.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
December 21st, 2011.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I specifically
remember that date.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And we were all
sort of preparing

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:90%
for the end of the world, 2012.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And so he said it was going
to happen at 2:00 AM, my time,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Eastern Standard, that I
had to be awake for it.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:90%
And just like that, he left.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if I was going
to get physically abducted.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
that looked like.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So two days later, I chugged
a coffee at like 1:00 AM.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And I started meditating
for about an hour.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And at 2:00 AM on the dot, he
appears once again, same being.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And once he appeared
to me in astral form,

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was to
follow him in astral form.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure how that
was going to happen.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:90%
So I follow him out of my room.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.630 align:middle line:90%
And we're leaving the planet.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I had never left
the planet in my astral body.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
that was possible.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.265 align:middle line:90%
So that was really cool.

00:09:35.265 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we're leaving
and leaving and leaving.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
towards the Moon.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:90%
So we go towards the Moon.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.517 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, my
goodness, there's

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
going to be a
meeting on the Moon.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:90%
How cool is this?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And instead of there
being a base on the Moon,

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
we actually went right
through the Moon.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:90%
And we went inside the Moon.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
giant, basically

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:90%
a hollow room inside the Moon.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And there were, I mean,
tens of thousands,

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
maybe hundreds of
thousands, of beings

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
all in this circular
room inside the Moon.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like there were
two beings from every species.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was a little bit rude
because I was just so shocked.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I started traveling
around the room,

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.823 align:middle line:84%
just looking at all of the
beings because it was--

00:10:18.823 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a trip.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: They were small.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:90%
They were big.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:90%
They were hairy.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:90%
They were gelatinous.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:90%
They were everything.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of the
physical beings being there,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.680 align:middle line:84%
there were also tens of
thousands of astral bodies.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell that
they were just like me.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And they had come
from planet Earth

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
because I could follow
their grounding cord back

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, OK, cool.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot of different
representations here.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And then there was this being
in the middle of the room.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:90%
And she was speaking.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And she gave us all
this information.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
she initially said,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:84%
this is a meeting being
held by the Galactic

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:90%
Federation of Light.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I had never heard that
term before in my life.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And she started talking
about, I mean, everything.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The planet is going
through a big change.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We need you to be aware of
this change at this time.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So was this
assembly specifically

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.640 align:middle line:90%
ordered toward Earth?

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, this was
specifically to Earth.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, on
behalf of Earth.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: On behalf of Earth
in particular and what

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:84%
we are about to encounter
in the next 10 to 20 years.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.872 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what did
they say at that moment?

00:11:26.872 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: There was
a lot of things.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
They even talked
about a time period

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.240 align:middle line:84%
where we would potentially
go through darkness.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And she was talking
about getting hit

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:90%
with a wave of energy.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And so now I understand it
as probably a solar flare

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that they were talking about and
that potentially knocking things

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
out but then ascending
us to a new level.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:84%
She also talked specifically
about the corruption

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that was on this planet
and some of the beings

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that have been here and
why they've been here

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.507 align:middle line:84%
and how they are being
asked to leave at this time.

00:12:02.507 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can we focus
on them for a moment?

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
certainly the thing

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that most people
are curious about--

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and I've asked other
people this too--

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:90%
a couple, only a couple--

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:90%
is, who are they?

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.207 align:middle line:84%
So the majority
of them on planet

00:12:17.207 --> 00:12:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Earth-- because there's a
lot of different forces.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And some
have best interests.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Some have not best interests.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're a melting pot.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, we are.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And so the one specifically
that they were referencing

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.937 align:middle line:84%
or she was referencing
was the Reptilians.

00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By the way,
that's the answer, everyone,

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:84%
no matter what their background
is and knowledge says.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And what was
really interesting--

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't even
second guess it.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But the information was
being, I guess, telepathically

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:90%
received by all of us.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, it's so
cool that she can speak English.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really understand
the translation at the time.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And what was also happening
was projections in the mind.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So there were also images being
projected while she was also

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:90%
explaining things.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first
time I got introduced to--

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:84%
she didn't necessarily
call them Reptilians.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:84%
She just gave a projection
of what they looked like.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I called them dinosaur
beings for a long time.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you hadn't
heard the term Reptilian?

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Because I had never
heard the term Reptilian before.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And so this was all
very shocking to me.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I
don't even know what

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.470 align:middle line:90%
to do with this information.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well,
that's understandable.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So then she said,
they're being invited

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
to leave and to reduce their
influence on this planet,

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:90%
to be polite about it.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.975 align:middle line:90%
And what did that look like?

00:13:36.975 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, telepathically,
as you're

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle line:84%
kind of scanning
the information, how

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:90%
was that expected to play out?

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So part of it, what this
being was mentioning

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
was that they are being asked
to leave from the Galactic

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Federation but
that a lot of them

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:84%
are refusing to
leave so that there's

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a battle going on, a
bit of a pushback on their end.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, if
they choose not to leave,

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.968 align:middle line:84%
the vibration switch or change
or increase that's happening--

00:14:06.968 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That should boot 'em.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.808 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Is going to eventually
kick them out anyway.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They won't
be able to stay.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.165 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:14:13.165 --> 00:14:17.310 align:middle line:10%
And so that was essentially
the primary piece of knowledge

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And just to really get
prepared for the shifting

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness on the planet.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, well, wonderful.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
that whole backstory.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.393 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
that everyone kind of knows

00:14:27.393 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:84%
what you've been
through, as we then

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
continue to this part
of the conversation.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So now, you've remained
in contact with them.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So how often will they come
through and speak to you?

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So after that point, my
main point of contact

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:84%
happened to be that Pleiadian
male that came to me.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Many years later, I
finally got his name.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:90%
And his name is Kinetik.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And so once I opened
up those channels,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I had so many
questions and so many--

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:90%
who are you?

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Why are you even bothering
with human beings?

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Like, what is the big
point of all of this?

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And so at first, I was in
contact almost every day,

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:84%
probably annoying him
with all of my questions.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, it happened
to be a once-a-month meeting.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you've met
with him recently?

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So I meet with them
still every month.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a while since
you and I met the first time.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:90%
And a lot has happened.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about, from their
perspective, what's happened?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
implications of this?

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Because as we spoke of
before, we could either

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:84%
have a very kind of a
slower, more polite way

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
of unraveling the infrastructure
of the corruption globally

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
or we could have it show itself
really fast, revelations of all

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.600 align:middle line:90%
kinds.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Rip off the Band-Aid, as
I said in the beginning.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So where do they
say we are on this?

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: We're kind of
in the middle right now.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of ripping off the
Band-Aid completely, which

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
would probably look like
a massive solar flare,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:84%
shutting down our
systems, forcing

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
us to change a lot of
our systems dramatically.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It would cause a
lot of destruction.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's not really a desired.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.442 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not.

00:16:18.442 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It's a constant
weighing of pros and cons

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.192 align:middle line:90%
within their counsels.

00:16:23.192 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
counsels dedicated

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:90%
to the law of non-intervention.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they discuss
often what is

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.680 align:middle line:84%
going to be best for humanity
overall and humanity's

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:90%
progression and ascension.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we are seeing
an accelerated destabilizing

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
of the old systems while also
maintaining a certain status

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
quo so it's not too
shocking on people.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing a lot of
rapid individual breakdowns

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:90%
and breakthroughs.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:10%
A lot of what took
me over a decade

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:10%
to understand and conceptualize
and realize and ground

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:10%
is taking people a couple
of months, which there's

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:10%
pros and cons to that approach.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.319 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of mental
health stuff that comes

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:90%
into play with that as well.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.199 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's almost as though--

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:90%
it's interesting.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, my group of
beings, I was talking to them--

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:90%
I was talking about many things.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But one of them at
that time, I was

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:31.330 align:middle line:84%
concerned about the dissipation
of the magnetic field that

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
would lead to some
kind of polar shift.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, yes.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
said what will

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
happen prior to that
that's interesting is

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that people will no longer
know truth from fiction.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:84%
They will not know whether they
dreamed it or experienced it

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
in real life, whether they
thought it or experienced it.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, we're rapidly
approaching that point.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.007 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for many
reasons of manipulation,

00:18:00.007 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:90%
we don't know fact from fiction.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
That's a process
that really has more

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to do with hijacking of
actual intellectual thought.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:90%
So we know that.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
We know that we're siloed
and all those things.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.270 align:middle line:90%
This is different.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond that.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:90%
And I saw your eyebrows go up.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So I know you have
something to say.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And so there is going to
be a period of illusion.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we see the
emergence of AI right now,

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of this
illusion coming into fruition.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So many people discredit
their own intuition

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and their own guidance because
they're looking at a video

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.172 align:middle line:84%
or they're watching politics
or they're looking at the news.

00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to a point--
and this is coming up really

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:46.980 align:middle line:90%
quickly--

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
where we can no longer
trust what we are seeing.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're there.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: We're there.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's only going
to be more and more--

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: --because
now what AI can do

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:84%
is completely copy
everything about a person.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And unless you're
there in person,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea what is
said, what is not said.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And so it's going to lead
into a lot of, I think,

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
rebellion, distraction, a lot
of pushback and protesting

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:90%
and confusion.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it's
all going to come back

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:90%
to your authentic intuition.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you totally.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:90%
We can't get away from it.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And we have started
diminishing-- if we ever

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:84%
had any sense of
our own intuition,

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:84%
diminishing its value
because we're overwhelmed.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, we need to talk
about the real crux

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:90%
of the conversation.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to
the Galactic Federation.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:90%
It's mind.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Sri Aurobindo-- the whole
universe is made of mind.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:90%
It's all thought creation.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So if this is true and
the Galactic Federation

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:84%
is saying we're
trying to help, we're

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:84%
making decisions,
first of all, can they

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:84%
do that on someone
else's behalf when

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:90%
we have to create the outcome?

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, great question.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:10%
So it really comes down to
free will versus destiny.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:10%
So at an individual
and collective level,

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle line:10%
we all have been
given free will.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that free
will has been manipulated

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:90%
over time and corrupted.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:84%
We have to agree
to certain things.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
pre-programming and manipulation

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and corruption from that
side comes into play.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the opposite side
with the Galactic Federation,

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
this is why they have
Council meetings,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:90%
the law of non-intervention.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So the Galactic Federation,
you can imagine them

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:90%
as our spirit guides.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's kind of
where I want to go with that.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And so the collective
consciousness of planet Earth

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.160 align:middle line:90%
has a blueprint.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:90%
We have a contract.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And we have a place
that we need to go.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:84%
We have a road that
we need to drive down.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And anytime we veer
off of that road

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.620 align:middle line:84%
or off of our own
collective timeline or path,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
the Galactic Federation
says, hey, maybe

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:90%
you want to think about this.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So they're just
here to steer us.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But they're not here to
completely intervene.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we
want to get to a point,

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and soon enough, where we
are not being influenced

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:90%
by any being, good or bad.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And we need to make a choice.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And the choice that we
need to collectively make

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:84%
is, do we want to be a
civilization of service

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:22.970 align:middle line:90%
to others?

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Or do we want to be a
civilization of service to self?

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, going to the next
step and how we get there,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:90%
which is to me--

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
it is kind of the only
question-- of all the questions,

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.300 align:middle line:84%
it's the only
question that matters.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:84%
How do we do that
individually and collectively?

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And this comes down to
a type of a reclamation

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:90%
of emotions and mind--

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because the two
like to play with each other.

00:21:52.995 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're influenced
by the subconscious.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So of course, as
we're going along,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:84%
more and more trauma
is being laid out

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.800 align:middle line:90%
before us to traumatize us.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
traumatized, you cannot access

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:90%
your intellect.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.463 align:middle line:84%
The more emotional and angry,
you cannot access the intellect,

00:22:07.463 --> 00:22:09.130 align:middle line:84%
meaning you can't
make a clear decision.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:90%
So pick it up from there.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So it has to happen at an
individual level first.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:84%
You can't care about the
planet and everyone else

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:84%
until you've really
figured out your own stuff.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, the
challenge and the suffering

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:84%
is actually a really
big part of this.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:90%
We live in a duality experience.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to understand
the lower frequencies.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:84%
We have to go through
suffering in order

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
to choose not to suffer anymore,
to choose unconditional love.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And a big part of
going through traumas

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and going through suffering is
to then take responsibility,

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
for I am creating the
suffering in my life.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I chose this timeline.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I chose this contract
in order to learn.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
If we were given all
knowledge, all experience,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:84%
if we were given absolutely
everything, all money,

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.860 align:middle line:84%
all finances, everything,
life would be boring.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:90%
There would be no movement.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:90%
We would be stagnant.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.745 align:middle line:90%
And we would be bored.

00:23:09.745 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:90%
We have to go through challenge.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:84%
We have to go through suffering
in order to move forward.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And at the point where we
think life is happening to us,

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be
a point in time

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
where we turn things around and
say, I am happening to life.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.430 align:middle line:10%
And if I have
chosen these things

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.020 align:middle line:10%
and I have the
suffering in my life

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:10%
and that's my own
doing, then maybe I

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:10%
can choose something else.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And when we take that
radical responsibility

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:84%
over our own choices
and our own life

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and we shift into a higher
timeline for us individually,

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:84%
we can then have the
radical responsibility

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:84%
to shift the collective
timeline into something that's

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:90%
more cohesive and harmonious.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Couldn't agree more.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I came across a little
YouTube video of Alan Watts.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Of course, he pops up a lot.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was on how
you start doing that

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.420 align:middle line:84%
from within because people are
essentially walking programs.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
If you're not hyper
aware and if you're

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
allowing yourself to engage too
much with the outside process--

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.400 align:middle line:84%
traumas, thoughts,
entertainment,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.730 align:middle line:84%
et cetera-- it starts becoming
more difficult to know

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:90%
your own thoughts.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And he really broke
down so nicely

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.147 align:middle line:84%
about what your
thoughts actually are.

00:24:18.147 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was beautiful
because we really

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
have to go back to basics
now in terms of understanding

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:84%
the nature of
mind, understanding

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
what the subconscious
is there to do

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and what it's promoting all
the time, which is survival.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nothing
more than survival.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not there to
make you happy.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:84%
It's there to make
sure you don't die.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.455 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:24:37.455 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to throw up
every nasty little thing that's

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.205 align:middle line:84%
ever happened to
you since you've

00:24:41.205 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:90%
been incarnating anywhere.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And that comprises a
lot of our thought.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:49.490 align:middle line:84%
If we're running off
subconscious programs

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
in the lower mind,
we're not in a position

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:90%
to create the new world.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk about higher
mind, interface with guidance,

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:90%
trusting intuition, et cetera.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Great.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:90%
So you used a word, which is--

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I think you used the word
consumption or at least

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:84%
alluded to the fact that we
are just taking in so much.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.410 align:middle line:84%
We are in a consumer
society right now.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about us
increasing our frequency,

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:19.120 align:middle line:84%
not only are we consuming
content or consuming junk food

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:84%
or consuming
whatever-- and it's OK.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Everything in moderation.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:84%
But we're also consuming
everyone else's energies.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And so the first step
in accessing a higher mind

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:84%
is to cut off the consumption
from the outside world.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
To be able to really be with
yourself without distraction

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:90%
is so key.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Wherever your focus
goes is what you create.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And so cut off your focus
from everything else

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:90%
that is lower frequency.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And we are existing in a
world that's crumbling.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a world full
of lower frequency.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So the discernment, the healthy
boundaries, cutting cords,

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.250 align:middle line:84%
saging yourself often are all
very important tips right now.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
point too is not just

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
being aware of what you
consume and consuming

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:84%
less on all fronts,
physically and metaphysically,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.372 align:middle line:84%
but then to shift
your perspective.

00:26:15.372 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And in order to shift your
perspective from a lower density

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.860 align:middle line:84%
survival mindset into a higher
density or a higher timeline,

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:90%
we have to focus on gratitude.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:84%
That is the easiest
way to shift.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.360 align:middle line:90%
So for example--

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very high frequency.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, very
high frequency.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
someone comes to me

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and they're like,
Elizabeth, I hate my job--

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:90%
my coworkers don't respect me.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting paid enough.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:90%
My boss will never promote me.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just stuck.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:90%
And I can't move.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.520 align:middle line:90%
And here I am.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, well, there's
all these things that you

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.600 align:middle line:90%
don't like about your job.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:84%
What is one thing that you
can appreciate about your job?

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, I mean, it pays the bills.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Great, focus on that.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:84%
There's always got to
be one little element

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.400 align:middle line:84%
to every situation that's
that silver lining.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we can focus
on that and harmonize

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:84%
with that silver
lining, we shift out

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
of that survival even
within something so specific

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:90%
like a job.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And either you lose your job
and you find a better job

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:84%
or you actually end up
getting promoted in your job

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and respected more
because you're

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.370 align:middle line:90%
shifting your perception of it.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
You've got to shift
the frequency first.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.083 align:middle line:84%
And then the physical
reality will follow.

00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:34.562 align:middle line:84%
And can I toss out another
idea that I work with?

00:27:34.562 --> 00:27:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is the best
worst case scenarios.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So if there is some
fear of whatever,

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.270 align:middle line:84%
whether it has to
do with your life,

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:84%
your relationships, your
housing, your income,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
to take some time to look
at your worst case scenario

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:84%
so that it's not the
boogeyman anymore.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.232 align:middle line:84%
And so once you see what the
worst case scenario is, ooh,

00:27:58.232 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, maybe that means declaring
bankruptcy, embarrassing,

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:90%
but can be done.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the relationship
ends, yes, and things that

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:90%
probably needed to end anyway.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.110 align:middle line:90%
But look at it.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And then think, so what can I do
from a worst case scenario part?

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've even said to
people, worst case scenario,

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:84%
you lose everything, go to
an ashram for a few months.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Meditate.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Clean the floors.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Eat healthy food.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:90%
And start from there.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.780 align:middle line:90%
That's your worst case scenario.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Lucky you.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Or you have to move back in
with your parents or your sister

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:84%
When you really
do look at what's

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
possible in your
worst case scenario,

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:43.353 align:middle line:84%
boom, that flat line or
fear base really leaves.

00:28:43.353 --> 00:28:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to what you're
saying but just kind of coming

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.397 align:middle line:90%
from the opposite end of it.

00:28:47.397 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:10%
Actually, I have a
teaching that came to me.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's called a
renew technique.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So the first step is recognize.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So recognize when you're
in a fear-based mindset.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Recognize when you have a worst
case scenario playing over

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.360 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.180 align:middle line:90%
So recognize that, perfect.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And then neutralize it.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we
can neutralize it

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.960 align:middle line:84%
is through observing
it objectively.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Play it out in your mind.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of the fears, all of the
anxieties, all of the emotion

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:90%
comes up.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.122 align:middle line:90%
Play it out again.

00:29:18.122 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
The emotions are
a little bit less.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.170 align:middle line:90%
The fears are a little bit less.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Play it out as many times as you
need so that you can look at,

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.953 align:middle line:84%
observe, play out the
worst case scenario--

00:29:26.953 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't run from it.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: --without a reaction.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Once you've neutralized
the worst case scenario,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.180 align:middle line:90%
then you go on.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:90%
And you utilize it.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So how do you utilize
that conscious moment?

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.012 align:middle line:90%
That's the worst case scenario.

00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:42.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm now OK with that happening.

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
best case scenario?

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Then you can build--

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.585 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:45.585 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because you're
not in fear anymore.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Because you're
not sucked into fear.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Bingo.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one other
little element, this

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.370 align:middle line:84%
is just something I started
playing with recently.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Lee Harris and I
did a book together

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:90%
called The Future Human.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And in it, they talked
about how, in the future,

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.520 align:middle line:84%
we're already starting
to go that way, younger

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:84%
people in particular
because you're born

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:90%
into a different frequency.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is we
are going to begin

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:90%
running mind through heart.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
fascination of the universe

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:90%
with the human species.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Doing that in a third
dimensional density and body

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:90%
is just the holy grail.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:18.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the bomb.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:90%
And they marvel at our species.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this tiny little
exercise, I find,

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.948 align:middle line:90%
is really helpful.

00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Just same thing
you're talking about.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Worst case scenario, you
filtered it through here now.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:90%
You've looked at it.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.470 align:middle line:90%
You're not running from it.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, take the same scenario.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Drop it into the heart.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And just sit there with
it for a minute or two.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Everything's neutralized.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Really, literally, almost
everything is neutralized.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
ugh, OK, I get it.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I can get through this.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so with everything you're
saying, a little technique like

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.420 align:middle line:84%
that, everything we're
afraid of right now,

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.550 align:middle line:84%
we can manage so
that we can start

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:84%
being creative and using our
greater mind because that's

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:90%
what's missing.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.810 align:middle line:90%
We're in a reactionary mode.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.467 align:middle line:84%
And we're acting very
ignorantly in a lot of cases.

00:31:03.467 --> 00:31:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely, yeah.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I get it because the
world is triggering all of us

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.100 align:middle line:84%
into the fight or
flight right now.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's about learning
from that and moving

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:13.940 align:middle line:90%
above and beyond that.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So explain a little bit
about that mind matrix

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:90%
too, how the universe is formed.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.700 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
but in a sense mind.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.400 align:middle line:84%
We already know there's no
physicality, doesn't really

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.400 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, exactly.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So something that I
work with often too

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:84%
is the collective
consciousness grid

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:90%
of the planet, planet Earth.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're moving
into, is this collective grid.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can imagine
8 billion people and very

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.520 align:middle line:84%
marvelous people,
every single person

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:84%
has learned a different
lesson along their path.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Every person has had different
past lifetimes that accumulate

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:90%
into who they are today.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.570 align:middle line:84%
All of that information is
stored within this consciousness

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.020 align:middle line:90%
grid of the planet.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, we access that
grid all the time.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was a study done with
monkeys quite a few years ago.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, they
observed a monkey

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.330 align:middle line:84%
utilizing a new tool
on this, like, island.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Halfway around the world,
all these other monkeys

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:90%
started utilizing the same tool.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:16.980 align:middle line:90%
There was no phone call.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:90%
There was no communication.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hundredth monkey.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And so it really
proved that we're all

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:90%
connected to something.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think the next step
for us is to consciously

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
be able to connect to
the collective mind,

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to connect to this
collective consciousness

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and be able to download
information and then

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.900 align:middle line:90%
upload information.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And we can practice this on
so many different levels.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So one of the fun things
that I did, maybe not

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:90%
so fun in the moment--

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.980 align:middle line:84%
about a year or so
ago, my dog ended up

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.370 align:middle line:90%
eating a lot of chocolate.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.110 align:middle line:90%
I was so worried.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:84%
We were like in Joshua Tree,
in the middle of nowhere.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, where do we even take
our dog to get their stomach

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:90%
pumped?

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And so she was laying there.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.100 align:middle line:90%
I was so worried about her.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I started to connect her
to the collective grid.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And I started to upload all of
the toxicity of the chocolate

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.130 align:middle line:90%
to the grid.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, there are
healthy dogs in the grid.

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:14.692 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to download
healthy dog energy--

00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:15.525 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:15.525 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: --and upload all
of this chocolate toxicity.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And she never got sick.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:21.970 align:middle line:90%
She never threw up.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And she was completely
fine all night.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So we can also upload and
download health and other things

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.540 align:middle line:90%
and share that collectively.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:30.415 --> 00:33:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So we've established now we
have beings that are helping us.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And it shows up in
the form of guidance.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.543 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we
open our intuition,

00:33:38.543 --> 00:33:40.180 align:middle line:84%
it can be to our
own higher mind.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be to that of another
one of these beings who are here

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:84%
to help us, nudge us
toward our destiny,

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:84%
which Earth has a pretty
profound destiny, actually.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We think we're losers.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We're a very interesting,
creative, beautiful species.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.410 align:middle line:90%
And so we touched on it before.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about love, in
the truest sense of the word,

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.500 align:middle line:84%
not in the sentimental
sense of the word,

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.090 align:middle line:84%
as the bridge that
can help us move.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.609 align:middle line:84%
And gratitude, actually,
to me, is a form of love.

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:09.409 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:10.489 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about love

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:12.239 align:middle line:84%
for a moment as
part of that bridge.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.039 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, unconditional love is
one of the highest frequencies

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.159 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And so when we can access
that within ourselves,

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:84%
we can then hold that space
for the rest of the planet.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So once again, it comes down
to the individual experience,

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.860 align:middle line:84%
the individual lessons,
and then embodying that

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and helping the rest of the
world with that as well.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:84%
So unconditional
love is something

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:38.929 align:middle line:84%
that we have to experience
from within individually

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.499 align:middle line:84%
before we can share
that with the world.

00:34:41.499 --> 00:34:42.540 align:middle line:90%
So same thing.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It all comes down to the
individual experience first.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't unconditionally
love someone else

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have unconditional
love for yourself.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.409 align:middle line:90%
We are all fractals of source.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So if we can find that
love from within, even

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.780 align:middle line:84%
in the darkest
moments, then we can

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:84%
share that unconditional love
to the rest of the world.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But it has to happen
individually first.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have a
different view on the notion

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.351 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people meditate because
our sensitivities are growing.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness of the
universe is in control now

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and taking us.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.360 align:middle line:90%
It's taking the planet with it.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're experiencing increased
sensitivity on many, many levels

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and as are all the little
newborns coming to the planet.

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it's becoming intolerable
to see cruelty play out.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people are like,
please take all of the cruelty

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:31.090 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.965 align:middle line:84%
But you have a little
different take on that.

00:35:32.965 --> 00:35:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, I
really do believe

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the suffering
and a lot of the challenges

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that we experience are
here to up level us,

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.710 align:middle line:84%
are here to help us
to learn to love more.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people
who have gone

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:50.190 align:middle line:84%
through the darkest and
the deepest experiences

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and challenges are
the ones who can

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:90%
rise to the highest timelines.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that
darkness and suffering are

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.210 align:middle line:90%
needed at this time.

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we
can eradicate that

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
through that unconditional
love frequency.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My beings
once said, it's

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.740 align:middle line:84%
just how humanity
learns at this time.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.707 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You will get to
a time when there will not

00:36:11.707 --> 00:36:13.410 align:middle line:90%
be the need for such contrast.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.702 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to learn in
a much easier, smoother way.

00:36:15.702 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
you are right now.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.210 align:middle line:90%
You learn through pain.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting,
which gets me into another

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.790 align:middle line:84%
point that I've kind of debated
a little bit with a couple

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.120 align:middle line:90%
of friends recently.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:84%
They'll be watching
various podcasts and videos

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.165 align:middle line:84%
and saying, well, everybody's
just playing their role.

00:36:32.165 --> 00:36:33.540 align:middle line:84%
They're playing
the role of dark.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're playing
the role of light,

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.230 align:middle line:90%
which I totally disagree with.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:90%
I agree we are what we are.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything we've been in,
incarnation after incarnation,

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.810 align:middle line:84%
has its vibrational stamp
on us when we incarnate.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.950 align:middle line:84%
We may choose to take a little
more challenging or life

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.190 align:middle line:90%
of a little more ease.

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
it's the collective

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.150 align:middle line:84%
of what we have
created as ourselves.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:37:00.142 align:middle line:84%
So if you're showing up as
an unkind, dishonest person,

00:37:00.142 --> 00:37:01.600 align:middle line:84%
that's what you've
brought through.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, you're
not playing a role.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:09.630 align:middle line:84%
You're serving a purpose perhaps
to show what we don't want.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So it gives you something
to bounce off of.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Dark and light can bounce
off of and create enough pain

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.690 align:middle line:90%
to learn from.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think these
are elevated statuses

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that someone's just playing
this role for Earth's benefit.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.502 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just authentically
who you are or are not.

00:37:25.502 --> 00:37:26.302 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Right.

00:37:26.302 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So not too long ago, I asked
the Galactic Federation,

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.910 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen when--

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:34.300 align:middle line:90%
where does all the darkness go?

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Where does all the suffering,
where does all the fear--

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:40.270 align:middle line:84%
once we get to a place of a
higher state, what happens?

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we do live in
a dualistic universe.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As we are now.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: So where does it go?

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought their answer
was absolutely brilliant.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.810 align:middle line:84%
But of course, take
it or leave it.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they said
that on planet Earth,

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:84%
say you have 50% of the
population who are in a lower

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:middle line:84%
density, 50% who are
in a higher density,

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and they're both holding those
individual linear frequencies,

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:84%
where we're going is each of
us is going to hold 50% and 50%

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:09.960 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be balanced
and harmonized within ourselves.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar to someone
coming to me and saying,

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.250 align:middle line:90%
I want to find my better half.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to find my
perfect partner.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, you've got
your better half within you.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not finding
your other half.

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're no longer finding
the other half to the whole.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.560 align:middle line:84%
We are becoming whole
individuals first.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we're trying to find
another whole individual.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're not balancing
out this world

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.660 align:middle line:84%
by having some
light and some dark.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
balance out this world

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:84%
by having light and dark
within us simultaneously

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and then being able to overcome
the duality by rising above it

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and being in a very
neutral zero-point state.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And we only have a
few minutes left.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But the notion that Earth has
been in this third density,

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:90%
she's rising out of it.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yep.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that is
going to a place that--

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:84%
as my guides once said, you
could say it's just like a 2.0.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:08.790 align:middle line:90%
It's the same Earth.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.240 align:middle line:90%
And you have the people.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.660 align:middle line:84%
But what you don't
have is the extremes

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.240 align:middle line:84%
in levels of
consciousness anymore.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.960 align:middle line:90%
It does start evening out.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
the contrast of dark

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and light the same in the
future because your planet is

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.840 align:middle line:90%
going into a higher density.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't require that
degree of duality at that point.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.150 align:middle line:90%
There's still duality.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.560 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't hurt.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the same way.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.595 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It's less
linear, more simultaneous.

00:39:33.595 --> 00:39:34.395 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:34.395 --> 00:39:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And so
an individual has

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
to experience suffering
and beauty in order

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to understand both,
to accept both,

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.235 align:middle line:84%
and then to rise above both and
observe them both objectively.

00:39:45.235 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And to give you something
as a choosing point.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
I don't choose to.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.630 align:middle line:90%
That makes me feel terrible.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't wish to feel that way.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I will not participate
in that any longer.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.798 align:middle line:84%
That's our own
process of refinement

00:39:57.798 --> 00:39:59.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're putting
ourselves through.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So we have a couple
of minutes left.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.520 align:middle line:90%
A couple of things.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.570 align:middle line:84%
First of all, are things
still in the works for you

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:09.350 align:middle line:84%
with a potential show
on network television?

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, I'm
sort of dabbling

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:14.214 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of different
areas right now.

00:40:14.214 --> 00:40:17.070 align:middle line:90%
But I do have a book coming out.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:10%
And it's called Your Anxiety
Is Giving Me Anxiety.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.540 align:middle line:10%
And it's a lot about
what we're talking about.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.620 align:middle line:10%
It's a lot about the consumption
of other people's energies

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.500 align:middle line:10%
and how that affects us and
how to get ourselves away

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.727 align:middle line:10%
from that anxious state
of being or that--

>>REGINA: I love the title.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.250 align:middle line:90%
That should do really well.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of trying to
bridge mainstream and then

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.100 align:middle line:84%
help people
reprogram their minds

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.640 align:middle line:90%
through the concept of anxiety.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.993 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
my next big project.

00:40:43.993 --> 00:40:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's going
to help so many people.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think so too
because you're very grounded.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.370 align:middle line:84%
You came in, lit up part
of the newer generations.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And then those little
tiny ones being born

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.570 align:middle line:90%
are coming in even more lit up.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't even fathom, by the time
I'm ready to exit this place,

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.020 align:middle line:84%
how brilliant these
young entities

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.577 align:middle line:90%
are going to be upon arrival.

00:41:02.577 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But then I get to be one
of them again too, right?

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.460 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So this circle of
entering the game

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:11.610 align:middle line:84%
as the frequencies are
raising considerably

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely fascinating.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think you are a good
representation of that

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.350 align:middle line:90%
to carry that work forward.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.823 align:middle line:84%
So any final thoughts
before we say goodbye?

>>APRIL: Ultimately,
I always like

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.852 align:middle line:84%
leaving off with the message
of how powerful you are.

00:41:25.852 --> 00:41:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us
feels disempowered

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:84%
because of our upbringing
or our pre-programming.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important to realize
that humanity is very special.

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Humans in general are
extremely powerful.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.550 align:middle line:84%
We haven't unlocked
all of our DNA.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And all it takes is a little
bit of extra gratitude

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.840 align:middle line:84%
to switch your perception and to
hop into the highest timeline.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.460 align:middle line:90%
It's time for responsibility.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.660 align:middle line:10%
It's time to take action.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's time to step
into exactly who you are.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:52.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:53.970 align:middle line:10%
And going back to
the previous point

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:58.070 align:middle line:10%
in our conversation, that all
has to do with laying rest

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.910 align:middle line:10%
as best one can to fear.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Fear is OK.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.870 align:middle line:90%
It can save you in a moment.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But you're not to
live in chronic fear.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.530 align:middle line:84%
That's not what the human
species was designed to do.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So if we can get
rid of the fear,

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:11.130 align:middle line:84%
then everything you're
saying comes into play.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Then we can actually use
our hearts and our minds

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.810 align:middle line:84%
to create this beautiful
world together.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:18.152 align:middle line:84%

want to thank you

00:42:18.152 --> 00:42:19.170 align:middle line:90%
for being so brilliant.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.237 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure I'll
be seeing you again.

00:42:21.237 --> 00:42:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:24.737 align:middle line:84%

your projects and your new book,
