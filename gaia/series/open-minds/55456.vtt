>>REGINA MEREDITH: What
would our world look

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:10%
like if all our energy
supplies were essentially free?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:10%
What would that do to
manufacturing and production?

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.230 align:middle line:84%
What would that do to the
potentials for human beings

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
across the world to be more
comfortable, more productive,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:90%
and more creative?

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, imagine a
world with truly clean energy.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
James Martinez has
been closely following

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.860 align:middle line:84%
the field of cold fusion since
its appearance in the headlines

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:90%
nearly 25 years ago.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Much is happening
behind the scenes

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:84%
now to bring this
much-anticipated technology

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.910 align:middle line:90%
to reality.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
James, it's great
to see you again.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:84%
It's been a couple
years since we've

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.333 align:middle line:84%
done an interview on
the subject and a lot's

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:90%
happened since then.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So for the benefit
of people who are not

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
familiar with this whole
subject of cold fusion,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
that's essential, I think,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
to start putting into
our consciousness

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:90%
on a variety of levels.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.755 align:middle line:84%
Give us a background
of yourself first

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and how you became
involved with cold fusion,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:84%
because they're going
to say, who is this guy

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and why is he telling us
the story of cold fusion?

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES MARTINEZ: Sure.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:10%
I got into the area of cold
fusion via a business colleague

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:10%
of mine by the name
of Walter Bowart, who

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book called
"Operation Mind Control."

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:10%
He was one of the people that
started the counterculture

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:10%
and kind of new news, like
fringe news as they call it

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:10%
today, through the "East
Village Other" in New York.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.527 align:middle line:10%
And we had an instant
connection about our lives

00:01:52.527 --> 00:01:53.985 align:middle line:10%
and our personalities
and so forth,

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:10%
and I was very interested in
what he'd done with that book.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:10%
And in that conversation,
he said to me, he says,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:10%
"Do you know about this
issue with cold fusion?"

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.414 align:middle line:10%
And I said, "Yeah, I do."

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me, "When did
you first hear about it?"

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.602 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well,
I was driving my car

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:90%
and I heard it on the radio."

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And my first reaction was,
when I heard it on the radio,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
is that these guys, either
their careers are over,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
or they're not going to
live very long talking

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
about this type of
technology, which is basically

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:90%
what it is in a nutshell.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.702 align:middle line:84%
It's because there's
a lot of confusion

00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
on how it should be addressed
and what it should be called.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Cold fusion tends to be the
name that people call it;

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.119 align:middle line:84%
however, they're seven
other names that are used.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, give us the
range of names that are used.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: LENR
and cold fusion,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
confuse the matter,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are primarily
used to address the situation.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So what it basically
means is, without getting

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%
into technical scenarios, is you
put a certain amount of energy

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.017 align:middle line:84%
into an energy source, and
you get more energy out it.

00:02:54.017 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's like--

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.474 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Over-unity.

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Over-unity, right.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And never ending
over-unity, perpetual.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So what that would mean is the
end of scarcity for energy use

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:90%
worldwide.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
when this came out

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.747 align:middle line:84%
on Time magazine,
Newsweek, cover--

00:03:12.747 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
when it came out.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: It was
all over the world.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I thought, oh
my god, it's really happening.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: It was
all over the world.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think at the time,
I was an environmental reporter,

00:03:20.905 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of fact, so I found
it is also very interesting.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And then, boom, dead.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Right.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.919 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dead.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So it was all
covered up, classified.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
The Defense Intelligence
Agency classified it.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Pons and Fleischmann,
Martin Fleischmann

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.842 align:middle line:84%
was the genius with Stanley
Pons that discovered this,

00:03:38.842 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and they were kind of premature
in their announcement of it

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and the way they announced it,
and it was all put undercover.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So my first learning about it
was listening on the radio.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But when I met with Walter
Bowart about it, he asked me,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
"Well, do you know
what the effects

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:90%
are going to do to society?"

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, I've
thought about it a little bit,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.668 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think it's
ever going to come out."

00:03:59.668 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just to
get clear on this.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Walter Bowart really
was tasked with--

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.879 align:middle line:84%
he had one of those minds
that could future pace--

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Very much so.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -on very
large systems levels.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.550 align:middle line:84%
That is what he
was well known for.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Very much so.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
even though we're

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
talking about what
"Operation Mind Control"

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.894 align:middle line:84%
as the book, that has
other implications too.

00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
get into it now.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.509 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: The
implications of that

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
were he was exponentially
exposed to what was going on

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
in the military industrial
complex about the use

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of behavior modification
on unwilling participants.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And when he announced
that with this book,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:84%
he was very much
into, OK, these are

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
all the problems in the world,
but what are the solutions?

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
solution-oriented

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
after the publishing
of that book.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.357 align:middle line:84%
And I was asked to
come in on something

00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
that was called the Freedom
of Thought Foundation, which

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:90%
was headed up by him.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Fletcher Prouty, who was
Mr. X in Oliver Stone's movie

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
"JFK," and he was probably
the intermediary person

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
between the Air
Force and the CIA.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.419 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book
called "The Secret Team."

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the big
people that found out

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.490 align:middle line:84%
the inner workings of the
military industrial complex

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and warfare and public policy
and Department of Energy,

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and he saw lots of
problems with it.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And the Freedom of
Thought Foundation

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
mostly began with cognitive
liberty, free speech,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
the ability to express
yourself under any conditions

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
in the news and allowing
that information to come out.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Also on the table
was what we were

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:84%
working towards was repealing
the National Security Act,

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing
forward cold fusion.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Fletcher
Prouty was involved.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Walter Bowart was involved.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.473 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Thomas Bearden
was involved also.

00:05:52.473 --> 00:05:53.056 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:53.556 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: And myself.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was brought in because of
my unusual perceptive skills,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:84%
a way of getting
through to people

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't nearly
have the credentials

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
that these guys did.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But I knew they knew I
was going to outlive it,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and they also knew
I was committed

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
to bringing this information
out on cold fusion

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and being involved with
the process of deployment

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:84%
of this technology
for the world.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
beginning for me there.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't do a lot
in the very beginning

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.027 align:middle line:84%
with it, though it was in
conversation all the time when

00:06:26.027 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I was working with Walter
Bowart because we were working

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:84%
on the kind of supplementary
published material

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:90%
after "Operation Mind Control."

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.367 align:middle line:84%
So I came in from a completely
totally different angle,

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:84%
because we knew at
the very beginning,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
this thing was going to
be totally covered up,

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:90%
but we knew it was the answer.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:84%
We knew right then
in the very beginning

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
that most of the world's
problems in terms of energy

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:90%
were myth.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we'd have to deal with
all the political, social

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.222 align:middle line:84%
ramifications, as well as the
media ecological ramifications.

00:07:00.222 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And economic.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.264 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: And economic.

00:07:02.264 --> 00:07:03.555 align:middle line:90%
Because it affects everything--

00:07:03.555 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: -by the
deployment of it.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So I-- in the very
beginning of my involvement

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
with this, he would
always lecture me,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.266 align:middle line:84%
because we'd have
very heated arguments.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
He'd always say,
"James, just remember,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.937 align:middle line:90%
technology dictates modality."

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And this was something
Marshall McLuhan brought up

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:84%
in "The Medium is the Message,"
and he had a lot of references

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to his work, because
we were concerned

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
about the effects of
technology and how would

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:84%
you take something this
powerful and then bring it out

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:90%
to the world?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
For you and me
and everybody else

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.450 align:middle line:84%
to end the dependency
on oil, end conflicts,

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:90%
liberate the human condition.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
He was very much
about liberating

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
the human condition
worldwide, as were

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.842 align:middle line:84%
these other people in
the very beginning.

00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So my involvement
from the very end

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
was there to-- instead
of pointing the finger

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:84%
at all the problems
of the world,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:84%
we were trying to say,
hey, wait a minute.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:84%
If this comes out on the table,
this resolves a lot of things,

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:84%
but it also changes the
structure of perception

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and affects the mosaic of the
sensory systems in which people

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:90%
interact.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways, when I was
talking on radio about that,

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:84%
is for instance, is the--
and I use this all the time--

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:84%
is the invention of the
telephone, or the cell phone.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.955 align:middle line:84%
Cell phones completely
destroyed social space.

00:08:26.955 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:90%
It's changed the family.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
It changes the
biological response.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's shocking.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.539 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: It's shocking.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, to go
into-- I'm in the airport

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:90%
all the time, right?

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Right.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To walk
through the airport

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's amazing that we're
not doing bumper cars, I mean,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
because nobody's
looking up anymore.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:90%
I just watch in amazement.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:84%
People are all walking
through the airport like this.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.897 align:middle line:84%
How do they even avoid
hitting each other?

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Correct.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
there's no connection.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: This is
one of the effects.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the inventors of this
were putting this together,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:84%
they didn't sit
around on the table

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.171 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, let's look at
the social effects of what

00:08:59.171 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:90%
we're doing here.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Nobody does that.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.694 align:middle line:90%
Nobody talks about it.

00:09:01.694 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Marshall McLuhan was
probably the first person

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that really talked about
the effects of technologies

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and what they do when they're
implemented into culture.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.065 align:middle line:84%
And Walter was like pounding
me and lecturing me constantly

00:09:13.065 --> 00:09:15.190 align:middle line:84%
about that saying this
needs to be out on the table

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:90%
and discussed worldwide.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Not just by political figures or
people in economics or artists,

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
but everybody in
different classes

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and different
cultural environments.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Because we knew that when
you place this on the table,

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:35.784 align:middle line:84%
like in a business sense,
your competition is finished.

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.115 align:middle line:84%
And so, it has not thus
far liberated humanity.

00:09:39.115 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
just, shall we say--

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: It's right
at the brink now.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.431 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's at
the brink, but it's

00:09:43.431 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
been totally-- they were--
Pons and Fleischmann themselves

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:90%
were slaughtered in the media.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.265 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: They were
totally slaughtered.

00:09:48.265 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Slaughtered
by their peers.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.036 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:09:50.036 --> 00:09:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we know what's
been building underneath it,

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:84%
because now there's serious
money, serious scientists.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.781 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: That's right.

00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:59.145 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can't see it
yet, but it's right there.

00:09:59.145 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But, let's talk about,
backing up again,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.120 align:middle line:84%
what Walter Bowart's vision of
how this would affect the world

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.530 align:middle line:90%
was at that time.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Just like you say,
no one envisioned

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:84%
how the fabric of society would
be changed with cell phones.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
What was his vision
of introducing

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:84%
essentially free
energy onto the scene?

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, one of
things is his interest

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
in me was not only my unusual
communications skills,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
but I had a real
problem with banks.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Now the first interview
I ever did with you

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
was regarding what I was doing
with the credit card user.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.666 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Helping people
basically clear debt.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Right.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:84%
By the use of this invention
called the credit card,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.950 align:middle line:84%
which, again, is an extension
of the central nervous system

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:90%
as all inventions are.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And Marshall McLuhan used to
say, man shapes his tools,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and then his tools shape him.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.669 align:middle line:84%
So when he found out that I
was suing all the credit card

00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
companies and banks and was very
successful at getting people

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:84%
out of credit card debt,
avoiding bankruptcy,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
getting their houses back,
he started to ask me,

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:84%
he said, well what are
the behavioral traits

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
having to do with
the use of this?

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Because he understood, and
Marshall McLuhan understood

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
this as he mentioned, that
when the electrification

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:84%
or electrocution of
society by the use

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.590 align:middle line:84%
of lightspeed communication
affects the structure of money.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So we couldn't have accumulated
mass amounts of debt

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
without the use of instantaneous
communication via lightspeed,

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.934 align:middle line:84%
via the transaction that
people use now today, right?

00:11:31.934 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.082 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So he spent lots
of time, and I was telling him,

00:11:36.082 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
well, this is what
happens and this

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
is what people do when they get
these contracts and people are

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.790 align:middle line:84%
desensitized to the
spending habits,

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
they're cut off-- they
do the same thing as when

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.430 align:middle line:90%
you go to Vegas.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.346 align:middle line:84%
They don't want you
putting cash on the table.

00:11:47.346 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
They want to exchange
the cash for the chips

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.104 align:middle line:90%
so it changes your perception.

00:11:51.104 --> 00:11:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
relationship to it.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.019 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:54.399 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Correct.

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And Marshall McLuhan talked
about the credit card

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:90%
and what it would do to money.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.275 align:middle line:84%
So when I would talk with
Bowart, I would say, well,

00:12:02.275 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:84%
this is what's happening
in the financial industry,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
but if we bring in free
energy, it's going to change

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.966 align:middle line:84%
the structure of money forever
because-- why would you be--

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's very abstract for
most people saying, what?

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.034 align:middle line:84%
How does free energy
change the nature of money?

00:12:21.034 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Because money as
what it is today,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:84%
is completely misunderstood
by most economists.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And they never talk about
instantaneous communication

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:84%
between ports A and B when we're
transferring money from A to B,

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and why all the banks
have been broken into,

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
why everything's been hacked,
why we have all this debt.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:84%
All of it's been
planned, of course.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:84%
But how do you
accumulate that much?

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:84%
You accumulate that much
by the instantaneous

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:90%
transaction of lightspeed.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:84%
McLuhan talked
about this in depth,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and Walter was a student of
his and actually met with him

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:90%
at his final lecture.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.902 align:middle line:84%
So in amongst all
of that while I

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
was doing that
stuff for the banks,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:84%
and eventually talked about
you and the effects of that,

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.427 align:middle line:84%
I was also involved
with cold fusion

00:13:04.427 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and what that would do to
change the structure of money.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go into
that for a second

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
because most people
don't understand that.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
If I have a cold fusion
device that gives me

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
unlimited energy and
my competitor business

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:84%
doesn't, and I'm using let's
say a 3D printer with an energy

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:90%
source to manufacture shoes.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:84%
My cost, and the amount
of labor, and who I pay,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.714 align:middle line:84%
I beat that other person
every time, right?

00:13:30.714 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So that's going
to change competition,

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:84%
it's going to change
what is money.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
If we have this ability
to have this free--

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Basically create
stuff out of nothing.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Correct.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Like right now, with
what's coming in the next five

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
to six years, just with the
exchange and the utilization

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
of the 3D printer
with cold fusion--

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:53.783 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: I'm sorry.

00:13:53.783 --> 00:13:54.283 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The manufacturing
game is totally changed.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Right.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.442 align:middle line:84%
China used to be the
work force of the world

00:14:00.442 --> 00:14:02.275 align:middle line:84%
and they used to beat
everybody because they

00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
had more people in the workforce
and they paid lower amounts.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Now that's going
to be different.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
That's going to completely
change manufacturing.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.225 align:middle line:90%
It's going to change warfare.

00:14:12.225 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:90%
It's going to change money.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
It's going to change everything
because we have the ability now

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
to take this energy source
and utilize it forever.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:84%
It's going to change--
it's going to distort time.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It will have all sorts of
unusual effects around it.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I always go back to the
effects of the cell phone

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.575 align:middle line:84%
because the cell phone
still today-- the cell

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:38.136 align:middle line:84%
phone supersedes
life, in general.

00:14:38.136 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:84%
They didn't think
they would have

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.045 align:middle line:84%
to make new legislation
because people would

00:14:42.045 --> 00:14:43.984 align:middle line:84%
be interested and
have no problem

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:84%
standing in the
middle of a street

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.454 align:middle line:84%
when traffic is coming
and looking down.

00:14:47.454 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Because they
have this media extension

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.980 align:middle line:90%
that's attached to their body.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.646 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:51.646 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And it has
more-- it supersedes

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:84%
logic and our own intuition
about our own personal safety.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Nobody said anything about that.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Nobody discussed it.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:84%
They just deployed it
and put it out there.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was never really
gone into in depth,

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:90%
the effects of that.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to have
an energy source which

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
is-- it's more valuable than
gold, diamonds, anything.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've said this in
front of bank people

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.262 align:middle line:84%
while they're bragging to
me about this new banking

00:15:19.262 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
structure that's
going to take over

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's a new economic change
that we're going to have.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.231 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, that's great.

00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to have this
backed currency and so forth.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what about this?

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
What about I put a
device in front of you

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:84%
that gives you this energy
or a bar of gold or diamonds.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.835 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the general
person's going to take?

00:15:38.835 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
They're going to take
the energy source always.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, true.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: That's how it
changes the structure of money.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.015 align:middle line:84%
So the people involved with
all this, they know that.

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But do they understand that and
do they talk about the effects?

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:84%
No, they don't
because scientists

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
have a certain fixed
perception about what is,

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and marketing people have a
complete totally different

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.664 align:middle line:84%
understanding about
how to discuss it.

00:16:03.664 --> 00:16:05.913 align:middle line:84%
And all these people, all
the scientists and everybody

00:16:05.913 --> 00:16:07.870 align:middle line:84%
involved with cold fusion
at the moment, which

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.320 align:middle line:84%
is a small amount,
they aren't talking

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:90%
about any of that at all.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.691 align:middle line:84%
I come in and say
well, what about this?

00:16:16.691 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen when
you put it in this country

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and how's it going to affect
competitor businesses?

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.299 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to be secret?

00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:90%
How is it going to be deployed?

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to deploy it, and
how is it going to be done?

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.833 align:middle line:84%
All those things need to
be discussed because it's

00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:84%
everybody's business, and it's
mostly the public's business.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:37.034 align:middle line:84%
It should not be up to some
bureaucrat or the Department

00:16:37.034 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:84%
of Energy or the
National Security

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Agency or the president.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the second coming to
liberate the entire human race.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what I bring
to it and I discuss it

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
to people because right now,
it's mostly about money,

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
control, who has
the rights to it,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and what is the best and
smartest way to deploy it?

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
That's really behind the scenes
what the top guys talk about.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.032 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so thus far,
it's been not just kept quiet,

00:17:09.032 --> 00:17:11.294 align:middle line:84%
it's been sabotaged
completely on every level.

00:17:11.294 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And would you say
because of the complexity

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:84%
of the issues you've
just mentioned,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that even though that has
been done for benefit,

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
for profit by the companies
who currently run the energy

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:84%
systems of the world,
would you say that maybe it

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
was even wise that it has been
stalled out this long on one

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
level because we haven't
answered these questions yet?

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.127 align:middle line:84%
Or would you say we're
there, we're ready now?

00:17:38.127 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: I think
we're ready, but I

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.560 align:middle line:84%
think it needs to be discussed
not just with the scientists--

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot
about scientists.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:90%
They're very narrow focus.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
because their job is

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.040 align:middle line:84%
to bring new things
to the world,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
not to think about
the rest of it.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know a lot
of wonderful scientists.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.733 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I adore
scientists and physicists,

00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:90%
but that's their world.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, and they cannot
be the only ones talking about

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.933 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: I have always-- one
of the things I was doing when

00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:09.132 align:middle line:84%
I was in my travels abroad was
I had been asked by people,

00:18:09.132 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
science people and other
people I knew in Washington,

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:84%
to put an international
consortium together of people

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.984 align:middle line:84%
to oversee the deployment
that are ethical--

00:18:16.984 --> 00:18:18.192 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A think tank again?

00:18:18.192 --> 00:18:18.604 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:18:18.604 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another
kind of think tank?

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, a think tank,
a communication tank about how

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
to deal with this issue so as
to not create war, economic war,

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.480 align:middle line:90%
so it's not abused.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Ethical people, not
necessarily scientists.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It could be artists.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.199 align:middle line:90%
It could be--

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
you know, as you're

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
talking about this, though,
just what you just brought up

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago about this
war, this economic war-- I'm

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
sorry to cut you off there,
but I want to get into this.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:84%
You have X number of hundreds
of millions, billions

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
of people around
the planet that rely

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:90%
on their labor for an income.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So when this is
deployed, when we

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.620 align:middle line:84%
do have access to
this energy source

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and when we do have a printing
of goods, so to speak,

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
what happens to the rest
of the however many billion

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.575 align:middle line:90%
people on the planet?

00:19:11.575 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Exactly.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do they derive
their income at this point?

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Exactly.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happens?

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're talking about--

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Do I have
the answer for that?

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -but it's a complete
restructuring of civilization.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Absolutely.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a total restructure
of civilization,

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and the point you
just brought up

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.334 align:middle line:90%
is exactly need to be discussed.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the
answers for that,

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.942 align:middle line:84%
but dialogue will kind of give
us a direction on what to go.

00:19:32.942 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can all move
into marketing goods.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.694 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Right.

00:19:35.694 --> 00:19:36.194 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:36.194 --> 00:19:37.856 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:37.856 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
We're-- the human race, all
the problems that people see

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:84%
in the news and so forth,
they're not really real.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:90%
All the solutions, we have them.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It's how to take
man's inventions

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and allow those
inventions to create

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:84%
win-win scenarios between
governments, between countries,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
between towns, cities,
and individuals.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So all of that needs
to be discussed.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And right now,
there's not really

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
a base, other than myself,
that just talks about that.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And every time I've ever
brought the subject up

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:84%
in terms of economics
and money and so forth,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of blank faces or
I don't know, or I want it,

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:90%
how do I get it?

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.705 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:20:25.705 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that
that's where most of us are.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:90%
I want it, how do I get it?

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, I want it.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: I want something.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:90%
How do I get it?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, and now that
brought up an interesting story

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:38.644 align:middle line:84%
because as I was talking about
this in tangent with economics,

00:20:38.644 --> 00:20:40.852 align:middle line:84%
somebody called in while I
was on the radio and said,

00:20:40.852 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:90%
well, we want it now.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, so do I. So what
was born out of that

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:10%
was the coldfusionnow.org.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.367 align:middle line:84%
Not yesterday, not five
minutes, we want it now.

00:20:52.367 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So that's
probably-- I initiated all that.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't run that website.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.577 align:middle line:84%
I participate when
there's big things that

00:20:58.577 --> 00:20:59.910 align:middle line:90%
have happened behind the scenes.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:84%
But that particular
news agency started

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.344 align:middle line:84%
for me and it's run
by other people,

00:21:05.344 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and there's all these guest
writers and so forth on there.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I did that is
because I wanted the public

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do all of it.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I want you involved.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:90%
I want these people.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I want everybody involved.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, our
consciousness has to be

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:84%
involved in it because
it's going to--

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.363 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Correct.

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:24.737 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -be up to all of us
to begin restructuring society.

00:21:24.737 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Correct.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you have 10,000
people laid off in a plant

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:84%
because this new technology
has just been implemented,

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
that's up to all of us
to start preparing for

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and think of how is human
time and energy utilized

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.060 align:middle line:90%
and supported in this.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.880 align:middle line:84%
We can all go into the Utopian
possibilities, and we have.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested in a lot
of the Utopian possibilities.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:84%
But those also require
us to kind of retrograde

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:84%
back into closer alliance with
the land, with small clusters

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.300 align:middle line:84%
that we live within
where we have

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
to learn to be more
self-sufficient at the same

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
time these goods are being
pressed out of printers,

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.220 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Right.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting to have

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to go back into something
closer to our roots,

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a functional way of
living, while at the same time

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:90%
benefiting from high technology.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:90%
We have to figure that out.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Right.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
This network actually
addresses that.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Whereas other ones, they
won't even deal with it,

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.569 align:middle line:90%
touch it, discuss it.

00:22:28.569 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And if it is discussed, it's
for a small amount of time

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and probably don't have any
idea of the ramifications.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
we're going to get

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:84%
into the state of the technology
itself in a little bit

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and talk about where we are,
how far away it is, where

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:90%
it's possibly being deployed.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, let's
talk about this perception

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:90%
issue a little longer.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You just came back from
England, and you were there

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:90%
dealing with media.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
You did a piece with the
Financial Times in London.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Mm-hm.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
I want to know

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
is-- it's one thing to be
interviewed and do a piece.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.622 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing to see what
happens when it's printed.

00:23:04.622 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Sure.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How was
it actually treated?

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Did they grok it?

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Did they look at any
of the complexities?

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
coup to be addressing

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:90%
such a respected journal.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:90%
So, this is how it came to be.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I received an email
from an inventor

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.520 align:middle line:84%
that the science editor of
The Financial Times of London

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.370 align:middle line:90%
contacted him.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd been in touch with
this person in DC.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:90%
They forwarded that email to me.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And then what I did is
I engaged the science

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:84%
editor from The
Financial Times of London

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and I called him one
day and I said, "Did you

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:90%
know this was happening?"

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, he didn't know
anything that was going on.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:84%
He was still trying to get
comments from scientists,

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't know the
effects of this truth that

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:90%
are happening behind the scenes.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So I initially called him over
the phone, introduced myself.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I said this is how
long I've been involved

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.203 align:middle line:84%
and where I've been involved
and why I've been involved.

00:24:02.203 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually
when I got to England,

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:08.860 align:middle line:84%
it was an interesting trip
there because I was there

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:84%
to debrief people in kind
of the British aristocracy,

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and The Financial
Times of London

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:20.455 align:middle line:84%
is the financial kind
of media environment--

00:24:20.455 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mouthpiece.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, for Earth,
out of the city of London.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Now they are-- I was
fascinated that they were going

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to run the 25th anniversary
article on Pons and Fleischmann

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and talk about this
at all, about where

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:84%
it is, because I
talked privately

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:84%
over the phone
with the guy and I

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
said, "You know what you're
doing here by running this,

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:90%
do you not?"

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You're changing
finance by doing this."

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
level-headed about it,

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Well, that's
what's going to happen.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.941 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the effects
that is going to occur

00:24:54.941 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and this publication is going to
be the one that runs the story.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So who has final say
about publishing it,

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and what would be
the reasons why not?

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And how are you
going to word it?"

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the
offices there and I

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.920 align:middle line:84%
spoke to Clive
Cookson who was there,

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and I spoke with him previously
about my involvement with it

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.156 align:middle line:84%
and then began to
tell him, I said,

00:25:24.156 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:84%
"You need to talk
to this person,

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.520 align:middle line:84%
you need to talk
this person, and you

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.728 align:middle line:90%
need to talk to this person."

00:25:27.728 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And I told him as an outsider
and a non-scientist who was

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:90%
leading the way, why there was--

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who all the
key players were, yeah.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.929 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Who all the key
players, and he knew that.

00:25:36.929 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted to hear my kind of
opinion about the secrecy of it

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of money--
all the biggest companies

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.930 align:middle line:84%
in the world that we all have
heard about, they're involved.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't want you to
know that they're involved,

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want any probing
into what they're doing.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of those groups is
Dr. Andrea Rossi's group.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.707 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:03.707 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And he
initially was very public

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.840 align:middle line:84%
about the E-Cat machine,
and then all of a sudden,

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:84%
because companies
like Mitsubishi

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.650 align:middle line:84%
have got a patent on
using cold fusion now.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Another company in Switzerland,
a big billion-dollar company,

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:90%
has taken out a patent on this.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was telling
him all this--

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
all competing patents?

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.674 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With Defkalion,
E-Cat, Brillouin.

00:26:27.674 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's like--

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.940 align:middle line:84%
We're putting out a BMW,
we're putting out a Ford,

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:32.520 align:middle line:90%
and we're putting out a Toyota.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
so now everybody's

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:90%
got their cold fusion devices.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want to
tell anybody about it,

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and they certainly don't want
to say what their plans are,

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:38.540 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.081 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So I'm telling
him-- so the Andrea Rossi

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
part of the deal was
is he shut his mouth.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give you
this massive amount of money

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to shut the doors.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've talked with
scientists about that

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of agree
that's a smart idea.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.427 align:middle line:84%
Because most of
the scientists that

00:26:55.427 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:84%
are involved in cold fusion
are walking backwards

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.500 align:middle line:84%
into their future because
they're concerned about what

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
happened with Pons
and Fleischmann.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.385 align:middle line:84%
And there's vested interest in
their careers being destroyed

00:27:07.385 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and this never coming
out for the powers that

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.270 align:middle line:84%
be that are part of
the cabal or whatever

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.340 align:middle line:90%
you want to talk about.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well,
they've gone secret.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I still can contact Rossi, but
he's not going to say anything.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And the group that kind of took
over everything he's doing,

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to
talk to anybody.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:32.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I made
arrangements for the company

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that is handling him to
talk to The Financial Times

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:90%
and introduce him.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even
respond to my email.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: They didn't
want to say anything.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, what happened?

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.174 align:middle line:84%
Were you shocked when you
read the final article?

00:27:45.174 --> 00:27:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: No, I haven't seen
the final article because--

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you haven't yet?

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: No, because they
were interviewing everybody

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if this is
going to come out or not,

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:57.267 align:middle line:84%
which is why I'm even talking
here in the first place.

00:27:57.267 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:90%
This is the back up.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:58.641 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:58.641 --> 00:28:00.917 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Or it could be
the front page situation.

00:28:00.917 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I told Clive,
I said, "Listen,

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:84%
if you don't put this out, I'm
going to talk about it anyway.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:84%
About me talking to you, about
you addressing this issue."

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.374 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can hide anymore.

00:28:09.374 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired of all the big
companies, everybody hiding

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and acting like this
is not going on.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Because all the lower
forms of humanity

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.850 align:middle line:84%
are involved,
don't kid yourself.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.795 align:middle line:90%
Greed, control, all the--

00:28:21.795 --> 00:28:22.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you bet.

00:28:22.725 --> 00:28:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: -big issues
with identity associated

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
with this and all
these things, which

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.320 align:middle line:84%
defeats the entire
purpose, I feel.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So then I told him about
what Brillouin was doing,

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:90%
and in fact they're--

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk
about who Brillouin is so--

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Brillouin is made
up of a Director of Sciences,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.079 align:middle line:84%
Robert Goddess, Chief Executive
Officer is Bob George.

00:28:45.079 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been to their labs
and I've seen everything.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I know everything
they're going on.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:90%
I have a great relationship.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:84%
I've also been at
SRI International.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I've see it, all of it,
right there before my eyes.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is these guys

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.480 align:middle line:84%
are talking about
commercializing

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.880 align:middle line:84%
this business using
law, which isn't set up

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:90%
to talk about this.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.540 align:middle line:10%
And I talked to
their lawyer and I

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.720 align:middle line:10%
spoke with this lawyer
that's representing Brillouin

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:10%
at this conference here
in Colorado, GlobalBEM,

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:10%
about how are you using
law to define and determine

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.510 align:middle line:10%
at the deployment of
this, walking backwards

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.580 align:middle line:10%
into your future,
and knowing there's

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:10%
no public policy about this.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.652 align:middle line:84%
How are you wording
your contracts?

00:29:25.652 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen some
of the contracts

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.780 align:middle line:84%
that investors have to
come in and sign off

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.560 align:middle line:84%
on when they say,
here, here's the money.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And it just-- I
look at it and I'm

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:84%
like, who would be
involved with this?

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.709 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:39.709 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, because
of the way it's worded.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.750 align:middle line:90%
But here's the situation.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Brillouin Energy, money
has changed hands,

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:90%
contracts have been signed.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:84%
What has happened now is
that the South Koreans are

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.019 align:middle line:84%
commercializing the Brillouin
Boiler, which means--

00:29:55.019 --> 00:29:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Speak
about how that works.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.752 align:middle line:84%
Just a little thumbnail
sketch of the technology.

00:29:58.752 --> 00:30:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: What
they decided to do

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:04.910 align:middle line:84%
is they wanted to retrofit
a boiler to existing power

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:84%
plants, because they thought
that would be the best ways

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.024 align:middle line:84%
to make alliances
with power companies.

00:30:13.024 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.754 align:middle line:84%
Use existing infrastructure
with new technology--

00:30:15.754 --> 00:30:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and LENR,
low-energy nuclear reaction.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:19.680 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:20.716 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:20.716 --> 00:30:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And that
way, the lobbyists

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.480 align:middle line:84%
won't come in and shut us
down, even though they tried

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.810 align:middle line:84%
to shut them down, but
they came to an agreement.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So the Brillouin Wet
Boiler is for desalination

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:84%
of water and
boiling water, which

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.560 align:middle line:84%
many cultures and
many manufacturers

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.180 align:middle line:90%
are all interested in doing.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:36.867 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:30:36.867 --> 00:30:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're still
using the steam effects of it,

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:39.950 align:middle line:90%
or what?

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For further
energy output.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Steam.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:42.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is that
various groups came in.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:48.830 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese have been there.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
All their scientists
have been there.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:51.840 align:middle line:90%
DARPA's been there.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.829 align:middle line:90%
NASA's been there.

00:30:53.829 --> 00:30:56.370 align:middle line:84%
All the big names that you would
think that are involved in--

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have
been to Brillouin?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Sure.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.006 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:30:59.006 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So the South Koreans
came in and did

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:08.210 align:middle line:84%
about a year of due diligence,
going through a fine-tooth comb

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:11.154 align:middle line:84%
with everything having to
do with what's real there,

00:31:11.154 --> 00:31:11.820 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't do
it with just them,

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.380 align:middle line:84%
they did it with
all the other guys,

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.800 align:middle line:84%
too, all the other
people that are

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:84%
having reactions
that are doing stuff.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.722 align:middle line:84%
So then they finally
came to an agreement.

00:31:19.722 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And then Bob George
notified me and said,

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.360 align:middle line:84%
"We've just come to agreement,
and now the South Koreans

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
commercializing this thing."

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.397 align:middle line:90%
That's a big, big deal.

00:31:28.397 --> 00:31:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a big deal.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.249 align:middle line:84%
That should be on the cover
of The Economist and Time

00:31:32.249 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:90%
and Newsweek.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: You would think.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You would think.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: You
would think, right.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But most people don't even
understand it, let alone

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:90%
know how to address it.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the things
I told The Financial Times

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.200 align:middle line:84%
of London, and I
said you need to talk

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:84%
to this person, this
person, and this person,

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and to get that out on the table
so that-- the train has left

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:84%
the station now,
and we're going.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
big shift that I

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:58.220 align:middle line:84%
was waiting for is to see
an outside company come in

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.941 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, it's
time to manufacture,

00:32:00.941 --> 00:32:02.815 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to
start deploying this.

00:32:02.815 --> 00:32:03.481 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:32:03.481 --> 00:32:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Now the question is
what happens when that occurs,

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.760 align:middle line:90%
what that's going to do?

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And is the public and
the consumers of energy

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.910 align:middle line:90%
going to be let in on this?

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I've talked with--

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Will the consumer
benefit in any way?

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: They should.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It should have lowered
energy costs, that's for sure.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Hello, exactly.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In manufacturing, and
ultimately to the home user,

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.520 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.269 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Right.

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
scientists, they won't

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.720 align:middle line:84%
say this publicly,
but some of them

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that I know, they
realize the benefit

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and what this is going to do
as far as healing the planet.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they see it.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.130 align:middle line:90%
It's their life work.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.700 align:middle line:84%
They cannot speak
like I do about it.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.710 align:middle line:84%
They have to speak
in scientific terms.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And quietly when
I speak to them,

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.974 align:middle line:90%
that's the way they view it.

00:32:46.974 --> 00:32:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other ones are
strictly about money and profit

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.564 align:middle line:84%
and me getting my
Nobel Prize, whatever.

00:32:51.564 --> 00:32:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.271 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Some are like
that, but some are not.

00:32:54.271 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So while I was in London
talking to The Times,

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:84%
I said this is my
opinion of what's

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.154 align:middle line:84%
going on, go and seek
it out and print it.

00:33:02.154 --> 00:33:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Do the
world a favor for once.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very interesting
to find out that the public,

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:84%
they want some authority
figure to tell the truth rather

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.260 align:middle line:90%
than the truth be the authority.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:15.640 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Like some people,
they want to hear what I have

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.870 align:middle line:90%
to say on CNN--

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But you can't--

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: -but I
wouldn't talk to them.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You can't blame
humanity for that.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.225 align:middle line:90%
We've been totally conditioned--

00:33:23.225 --> 00:33:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Completely.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -as Walter Bowart--

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -and
McLuhan would say.

00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:84%
We have been conditioned
to wait for our news

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.947 align:middle line:90%
from some perceived expert.

00:33:31.947 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Correct.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's
everybody's business

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:84%
to be involved with it and to
have some say in the matter,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.400 align:middle line:84%
instead of going
through our existing

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.690 align:middle line:84%
broken political system,
which isn't working anymore.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And our
broken media system.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Absolutely.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And Gaiam TV is--
this is the new news.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:52.679 align:middle line:90%
The real one.

00:33:52.679 --> 00:33:53.470 align:middle line:90%
The real news here.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And as
you know, I rarely

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.134 align:middle line:84%
like to do interviews
face-to-face on camera.

00:33:59.134 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And I haven't
done one for a long time,

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.691 align:middle line:84%
and you're the only
one that I would really

00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:03.544 align:middle line:90%
go to at this point.

00:34:03.544 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And I
appreciate that.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.410 align:middle line:90%
But I do have a memory.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So now, since we have
spoken about this

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:84%
before, I remember
a couple of years

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:13.319 align:middle line:84%
ago it was thought that
the Defkalion Group out

00:34:13.319 --> 00:34:17.260 align:middle line:84%
of Greece, who were working
with Rossi initially,

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.460 align:middle line:84%
it was thought
that we were going

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:84%
to start seeing actual-- they
even had price tags on it--

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:84%
home units where you could
convert your home's energy

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:84%
supply to these
cold fusion devices

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and be essentially off the
grid for a tiny, tiny amount

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:34.710 align:middle line:90%
of money.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.002 align:middle line:90%
What happened with all of that?

00:34:36.002 --> 00:34:37.626 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard
anything more about it?

00:34:37.626 --> 00:34:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: It's not over.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.719 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: It's
not over at all.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Ironic to the situation, before
I arrived in Boulder here

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to speak with you, this
I can't talk about,

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.170 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you that issue
that you were talking about,

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to go away.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
still on the table?

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.684 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Oh,
it's on the table.

00:34:52.684 --> 00:34:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those devices
are still there?

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.685 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No.

00:34:54.685 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
They're-- they have to deal
with that because of other

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.080 align:middle line:84%
ramifications that have occurred
from my visit in England

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and other things that I've
talked about this week

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.140 align:middle line:84%
regarding-- see,
because right now,

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.771 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with we need
money to do this to get it out,

00:35:08.771 --> 00:35:09.270 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, if you're
going to put money in it,

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.475 align:middle line:84%
well then you've
got to benefit you

00:35:13.475 --> 00:35:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and you and all these other
people in a certain way

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.230 align:middle line:90%
ethically.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.761 align:middle line:84%
So that's on the table and
that will be happening.

00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I assure you that
will be happening.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that brings
in the big problemo which

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:28.337 align:middle line:84%
is human beings becoming
untethered from the grid.

00:35:28.337 --> 00:35:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: That's
one of the effects.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.419 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
one of the effects,

00:35:31.419 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:84%
but that's also one of
the issues, big issues,

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
because now you're
talking about sovereignty.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Correct.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:38.735 align:middle line:90%
Which is the whole point.

00:35:38.735 --> 00:35:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Exactly.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.244 align:middle line:90%
From slavery to sovereignty.

00:35:43.244 --> 00:35:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Now, it's
interesting you brought up

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that word because the
first person that ever took

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.450 align:middle line:84%
a public I'm going
to stand by this

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.340 align:middle line:84%
was Russell Means, the
great American Indian.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Now his wife,
who I spoke to last week,

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:90%
mentioned the word sovereignty.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.720 align:middle line:84%
She goes, this is the changing
over from humanity from slave

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.705 align:middle line:84%
to sovereignty, which
is the real issue why

00:36:09.705 --> 00:36:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm really involved.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Because of what money
has done to people,

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.440 align:middle line:84%
what it's done to
society, and what

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.365 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the money changers
of what-- the effects

00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:84%
they've had on families, and the
whole thing from top to bottom.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And this-- I've always felt this
particular deployment of this

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.790 align:middle line:90%
will cancel a lot of that out.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:36.064 align:middle line:84%
But some people think that you
should work for me because.

00:36:36.064 --> 00:36:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Because I said so.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.307 align:middle line:84%
Because I have this last name
and we've built up society

00:36:41.307 --> 00:36:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and we're the ones that have all
the money, and that's the way

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:90%
it's to be.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A kind of
personal imperialism, yeah.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Correct.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.350 align:middle line:90%
That's going to end anyway.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So when I was talking with Clive
Cookson at The Financial Times

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.225 align:middle line:84%
about this, I said, do you
know how important this is

00:36:55.225 --> 00:36:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and what this really means?

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And he understood all of it and
had a very level head about it.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not that
comes out or not,

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:04.380 align:middle line:84%
it's irrelevant because now
it's coming out anyway here.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think that what's
going to happen,

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.700 align:middle line:84%
what I know is
going to happen, is

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:15.290 align:middle line:84%
there is going to be more public
involvement that I know about

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:19.140 align:middle line:84%
now, that I will be
involved in hands on.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I've agreed to keep
all of that quiet

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.310 align:middle line:84%
just because I have to be in
a kind of win-win relationship

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:84%
with the science guys that
are actually going to do it.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.586 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:29.586 --> 00:37:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Because they're frightened.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:31.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have to--

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Sure they are.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's only fair to say,
I mean, a lot of people say,

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.861 align:middle line:84%
well, why didn't they just
stand up and go for it?

00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:40.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't go for it when your
life is being threatened, when

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:84%
your lab is being trashed,
when your technology is being

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.010 align:middle line:84%
confiscated, when your patents
are being patently rejected

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.470 align:middle line:90%
by the patent office.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
difficult scene

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.530 align:middle line:90%
to navigate for these guys.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:90%
They're brainiacs.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.640 align:middle line:84%
They're there to
create technology,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.300 align:middle line:84%
not to have to navigate all
that, no less figure out

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.477 align:middle line:84%
the extended societal
effects of it.

00:38:02.477 --> 00:38:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Exactly.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.393 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then how to
release that information

00:38:05.393 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.833 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Exactly.

00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it does take
a large team of people--

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Absolutely

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.543 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -to bring
this about, but they all

00:38:11.543 --> 00:38:14.320 align:middle line:84%
have to be operating from a
similar level of consciousness.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is what's
not happening yet.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Exactly.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The heart of the matter is
always a matter of the heart.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:22.633 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So I always mention
this when I'm talking to these

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:26.890 align:middle line:84%
guys of what's-- coming
from that position,

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:84%
this is our second chance for
the whole world to clean up

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
the mess that we've
done to the environment.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: However, we hear
all the green environmentalist

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.680 align:middle line:84%
or whatever kind
of taking that tool

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and using it to make massive
profits for themselves.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And they take that excuse
and then they decide to,

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.017 align:middle line:84%
well, you need to do it our way
and we've got all the answers,

00:38:52.017 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to pay
this amount of money

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.040 align:middle line:90%
for us to clean this up.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's not exactly how
to do it, I don't think.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:58.870 align:middle line:90%
No, I agree with you.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.655 align:middle line:84%
Now another thing you
told me about-- now

00:39:01.655 --> 00:39:03.180 align:middle line:90%
this was maybe a year ago.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:90%
This was not on camera.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.590 align:middle line:84%
You were suggesting
that it might

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:11.050 align:middle line:84%
have been a potential
for this technology

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.630 align:middle line:84%
to be released on
reservation lands

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.270 align:middle line:84%
where it is beyond the arm of
anything, any of the governing

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:20.720 align:middle line:84%
bodies and so forth, and where
there's so much off the grid

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.540 align:middle line:84%
stuff happening anyway and
poverty that the people would

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.940 align:middle line:90%
benefit tremendously from this.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know before Russell
died not long ago,

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:30.744 align:middle line:90%
this was a plan in motion.

00:39:30.744 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so what's
happening with that plan?

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: OK.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:35.699 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't know
if his wife, Pearl,

00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:38.350 align:middle line:84%
one of the most beautiful women
in the world on every level I

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:84%
might say, dignified,
beautiful, wise woman,

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she's
still involved but--

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Very.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Very.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what's--

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: So I will tell you.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
might be happening?

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So initially,
Russell came to me

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.820 align:middle line:84%
in the last stage
of his life and I

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.360 align:middle line:90%
was very involved with him.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was reluctant to
get involved with him

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.557 align:middle line:84%
because initially, when I
got on the phone with him,

00:40:02.557 --> 00:40:04.640 align:middle line:84%
it was like, well, let's
do a radio show together.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well, I'm
extremely controversial,

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't care and this
is what I'm doing.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I was going head-to-head
with the banks at that point.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let me give
you the background,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.060 align:middle line:90%
and like I've told you.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he came
to me on a phone call

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.059 align:middle line:84%
and he said, can you get me one
of these cold fusion devices?

00:40:21.059 --> 00:40:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the exact
moment when he asked me,

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I was standing in
front of a store

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and I stopped in my tracks.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going, that
is the craziest request

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.150 align:middle line:90%
I've ever heard of.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Why would someone
want to give that you?

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I got everybody asking
me for that type of stuff.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought about it and
I said, "Well, let me ask, OK?"

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.310 align:middle line:90%
So a week went by.

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I talked to all the
leaders and explained

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.794 align:middle line:84%
who he was to the world
and how important he was.

00:40:56.794 --> 00:40:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the unique
nature of reservation life.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.135 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: The
unique nature, yes.

00:41:01.135 --> 00:41:03.510 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that you
brought that up because there's

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:07.030 align:middle line:84%
a big situation
going on with that.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So I got an answer
from Brillouin Energy

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:16.320 align:middle line:84%
that they would donate a
device to the Russell Means

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Library, which will be
built in South Dakota.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And while I was in London, I met
with an award-winning architect

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.850 align:middle line:84%
designer by the name
of Pedro Roos, who's

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:31.640 align:middle line:84%
agreed to do the
design pro bono.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: That was one
of the big successes--

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Incorporating
this particular technology.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.618 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Absolutely.

00:41:36.618 --> 00:41:38.045 align:middle line:84%
He knew this is
the big deal here.

00:41:38.045 --> 00:41:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So, I was
there sitting next to him

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:46.180 align:middle line:84%
with Sean Stone, Oliver Stone's
son, and sitting next to me

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.790 align:middle line:84%
was an author by the
name of Susie Anthony.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And before I even
finished explaining this,

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.890 align:middle line:90%
he already agreed to do it.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So we've got an
award-winning designer

00:41:56.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that's going to come in and
go to the location of where

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.910 align:middle line:84%
this library is
going to be built.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:07.190 align:middle line:84%
There will be a device
in there for sure.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Who's
going to make it

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and who's going to have
their name on top of it, that

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.470 align:middle line:84%
is up for discussion
because things have changed.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So I actually spoke to Pearl
Means a couple of days ago

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and meetings have taken
place between certain tribes

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.020 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
distinct advantage

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:35.240 align:middle line:84%
about deploying
something over there.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Now Russell knew.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.590 align:middle line:84%
He was a very, very
wise intuitive guy.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I agreed to do it, I
agreed to do it because one,

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.430 align:middle line:84%
he asked for it, and two,
I don't think history

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.175 align:middle line:84%
should be allowed to
forget what happened

00:42:53.175 --> 00:42:54.590 align:middle line:90%
to the American Indian people.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And most Americans don't know
that 100 million, at least,

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:90%
were slaughtered.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.534 align:middle line:84%
And that culture
has been forgotten.

00:43:02.534 --> 00:43:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Most people have no
idea what's going on

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.530 align:middle line:90%
with the American Indians.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So I felt it would be symbolic
and important to resurrect

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that culture via
Russell Means, to put

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.360 align:middle line:84%
this device in the
Russell Means Library.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of really big
people involved with this now,

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and that is going
to move forward.

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've had conversations
with people in Washington,

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I've had conversations with
people in Europe about it.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is probably one of
the most significant landmarks

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:35.910 align:middle line:84%
that will ever come
to be, actually.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I am so
excited about this.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Can't wait.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I hope I can be in on
the story when it comes,

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.640 align:middle line:84%
we can be there
with a camera crew.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, you just brought
up the legislature.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think Dennis Kucinich
is another one who

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:84%
I admire greatly
as a politician.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.080 align:middle line:90%
He's been very brave.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.880 align:middle line:84%
He's stood in the face of
the rest of his colleagues

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.864 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of issues.

00:43:55.864 --> 00:43:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:59.910 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know I was
going to meet him in London.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I went to a big benefit with
kind of the rich of England.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It was set up by a member of
the kind of British aristocracy.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Lady Tracy
Worcester invited me

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.660 align:middle line:90%
to an event in London.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.320 align:middle line:84%
He was so one of the
keynote speakers there.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got to say
this because there's

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:24.150 align:middle line:84%
very few people in the world
that are master listeners, OK.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:29.830 align:middle line:84%
He's one of them,
which is remarkable.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:33.690 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the room with
him, he knew exactly who I was.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he came
right up to me and he

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.370 align:middle line:84%
knew who I was, he says, "You're
with a Marshall McLuhan Center

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:43.181 align:middle line:84%
on Global Communications,"
which was surprising.

00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A well-informed man.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Very informed.

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Very informed.

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:46.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, "How do you know that?"

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't have a website.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't do social media.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I stay behind the scenes
on purpose by design,

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.665 align:middle line:90%
and he knew exactly who I was.

00:44:53.665 --> 00:44:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And then I
proceeded to debrief him

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.980 align:middle line:90%
on what's going on.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And he listened very
carefully and responded

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:03.700 align:middle line:90%
very intelligently.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was quite really
happy to talk to him

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.320 align:middle line:90%
about that, actually.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and he said,
"Well, I want to be involved."

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, "Here's--"
he looks at me and he goes,

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:22.410 align:middle line:84%
"You're creating a
hole here, aren't you?"

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.986 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Yeah, and
you know why, don't you?"

00:45:24.986 --> 00:45:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to explain
anything to the guy.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.504 align:middle line:84%
He knew exactly what I was
planning on doing with this.

00:45:29.504 --> 00:45:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "The
time has come now

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.020 align:middle line:84%
for the whole world--
for this new beginning

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.080 align:middle line:84%
for the whole world,
not just financially."

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "This was
invented in the United States.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.690 align:middle line:84%
This was-- we should
be the leaders.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.887 align:middle line:84%
We are the leaders right
now, but most of the world

00:45:45.887 --> 00:45:46.470 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know."

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I'm
putting together

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:52.250 align:middle line:84%
an international consortium
of people, such as yourself,

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily politicians
or post politicians,

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:59.250 align:middle line:84%
but artists,
engineers, scientists,

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.930 align:middle line:84%
entertainers that are
ethically inclined

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:04.509 align:middle line:90%
to discuss this matter."

00:46:04.509 --> 00:46:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Yeah, I
would love to be involved."

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke to him
for about 45 minutes,

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and then he made sure
I had the ability

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.440 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with him.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's come-- actually coming
out to California right now,

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and I may be in
communication with him

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.850 align:middle line:84%
while he's in California,
because I invited him.

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:24.397 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Listen, don't believe
anything I'm telling you.

00:46:24.397 --> 00:46:26.730 align:middle line:84%
The doors are open for you
to go this SRI International,

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.830 align:middle line:90%
they'll show you everything."

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And he was quite
excited about that

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.860 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't really
know what was going on.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
this has actually

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.130 align:middle line:84%
made it quite a bit further than
just the last time we talked.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:37.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot has happened in
the last year or two.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes. yes.

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.501 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then just making
its way into pop culture

00:46:40.501 --> 00:46:42.780 align:middle line:84%
so we can start embracing
it, as I mentioned earlier.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.630 align:middle line:84%
What's Sean Stone's
role in this?

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:47.790 align:middle line:84%
What is he going to do
as a young producer?

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: He has
been remarkably,

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.740 align:middle line:84%
for a young guy, really brave
about addressing all this.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:58.252 align:middle line:84%
This guy is totally
committed to social change

00:46:58.252 --> 00:46:59.460 align:middle line:90%
for the benefit of everybody.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:46:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Big time.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:01.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really neat guy.

00:47:01.493 --> 00:47:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And when I
was with him in England,

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.600 align:middle line:84%
arrangements had been made by
a gentleman in Australia, who

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.730 align:middle line:84%
flew me out to England, but
the gentleman in Australia

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:14.720 align:middle line:84%
made arrangements
for me to go meet

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.530 align:middle line:84%
with the British government in
the form of Lord May at Oxford

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:20.870 align:middle line:84%
University to tell
him about what

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.530 align:middle line:90%
was going on in cold fusion.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Now initially, I
was like, OK, now

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:29.120 align:middle line:84%
this is getting real
serious because I'm

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.894 align:middle line:84%
going to be interfacing
with the empire.

00:47:31.894 --> 00:47:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: OK.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.554 align:middle line:84%
And we were driving to Oxford
University and Sean was with me

00:47:36.554 --> 00:47:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and he's all suited up, and
I'm there with another person,

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Susan Anthony was there.

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And he made arrangements
to meet with us,

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and what I foresaw and
suspected to happen did happen.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.190 align:middle line:84%
He was very gracious
to meet with us.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But when I did meet with
him, I got not only him,

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.740 align:middle line:84%
but the entire royal
oligarchy, if you

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.790 align:middle line:84%
want to talk to it that way, was
there with him sitting with me.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And initially when we
were talking about it,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.040 align:middle line:84%
he was listening, he didn't
know anything about it.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But then the conversation
changed, because both Sean

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and Susan, they
left because they

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.640 align:middle line:84%
knew I wanted to talk
to him on my own, right?

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.005 align:middle line:84%
And then the conversation
changed dramatically.

00:48:18.005 --> 00:48:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so,
Lord May, I said,

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:24.730 align:middle line:84%
what happens when new
technology comes in England

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.250 align:middle line:90%
and how is that addressed?

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Who in the government
do you talk to you

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:30.210 align:middle line:90%
about something like this?

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:31.370 align:middle line:90%
He goes, "Me.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.270 align:middle line:90%
I am the government."

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:34.000 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "OK."

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, I am
cold fusion, myself."

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bold
claims on your parts.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:40.278 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:48:40.278 --> 00:48:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to tell you,
I'm kind of its messenger--

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:44.160 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't know
anything about it.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: He didn't
know anything about it.

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:46.630 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know anything
about the data.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:47.550 align:middle line:90%
He knew nothing.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, later on,
privately he said-- on my way

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.330 align:middle line:84%
out he said, "Good luck
with the cold fusion thing.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.652 align:middle line:90%
You're gonna need it."

00:48:55.652 --> 00:48:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah,
and which I took it--

00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.165 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's was
good, rousing endorsement

00:48:59.165 --> 00:49:00.230 align:middle line:90%
for the technology.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:02.396 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, and I was
just laughing at the guy

00:49:02.396 --> 00:49:04.540 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't want
to acknowledge it.

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So no real curiosity
to embrace it any further,

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.670 align:middle line:84%
explore it further, on
behalf of his nation.

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, he knows.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.035 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
acknowledge it.

00:49:11.035 --> 00:49:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Because I told
him, "You better check

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:14.936 align:middle line:84%
this out of what's
going on at SRI.

00:49:14.936 --> 00:49:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You better talk with
these scientists."

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.393 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just the
United States, though.

00:49:18.393 --> 00:49:20.300 align:middle line:84%
He didn't acknowledge
it at all, which

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.190 align:middle line:84%
wasn't disappointing to me
because it was a historical.

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.145 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Because
I told him, I

00:49:24.145 --> 00:49:26.900 align:middle line:84%
said, "Listen, I've
not signed off on this.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to talk about it."

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "Whoa,
stay in touch with me.

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Stay in touch with me."

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.846 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, I will
at the appropriate time."

00:49:32.846 --> 00:49:34.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what's
so interesting,

00:49:34.345 --> 00:49:35.520 align:middle line:90%
you just said this before.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.004 align:middle line:84%
You mean a lot of the
real groundbreaking work

00:49:38.004 --> 00:49:39.670 align:middle line:84%
has been happening
in the United States,

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:41.879 align:middle line:84%
but it's South Korea
that's embracing it.

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:43.420 align:middle line:84%
It'll be China's
that's embracing it.

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.086 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:49:44.086 --> 00:49:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just like the
new economic systems

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that are preparing behind the
scenes to be brought forward,

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.130 align:middle line:84%
the last one on board,
as usual, is always

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:56.420 align:middle line:90%
the United States of America.

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
too-- what is it?

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:58.550 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Trying to squeeze
the last little bit

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:04.920 align:middle line:84%
of gold out of any given old
paradigm before a new one

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:05.770 align:middle line:90%
can come in?

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:09.450 align:middle line:84%
What is it about the power
and greed factor here?

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Based upon my
experience and my involvement

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.300 align:middle line:84%
dealing with money and
debt and new currencies,

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and where are we going,
what are we doing,

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a vested
interest, as you

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:26.789 align:middle line:84%
know, about clearing the way
for the new society to come in.

00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And rather than go into
the details of that

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.446 align:middle line:84%
because I know other people
have talked about it with you--

00:50:30.446 --> 00:50:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: I think
there's a clearing the way

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.850 align:middle line:90%
to begin this new era.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people say
we have-- there's too

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.040 align:middle line:90%
many people on planet Earth.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
potentially reduce

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:49.281 align:middle line:84%
that, which that's a
very serious issue on how

00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:50.030 align:middle line:90%
that's being done.

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.530 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:53.248 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: -a lot of
people know that already.

00:50:53.248 --> 00:50:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So this changes the
equation dramatically

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:02.090 align:middle line:84%
about some of the things--
population, which I think

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:03.652 align:middle line:90%
is a total myth.

00:51:03.652 --> 00:51:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: This comes down
to human changing behavior

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.610 align:middle line:90%
on how we deal with each other.

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.945 align:middle line:84%
Most wars are based
on scarcity and oil

00:51:14.945 --> 00:51:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and nonsense when nobody
agrees, when nobody wants

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:21.420 align:middle line:84%
to-- no American really
wants to be in any more wars.

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.290 align:middle line:84%
The public is completely
separated from people

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I talk to about what's
going on over there.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.850 align:middle line:84%
The general public,
they don't want war.

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They want this new
stuff to come out.

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.880 align:middle line:90%
They want to regroup.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.090 align:middle line:90%
They want to go off the grid.

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.314 align:middle line:84%
They want to live in
harmony with the Earth,

00:51:34.314 --> 00:51:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's
really going on.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But depending upon
who you talk to,

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:39.920 align:middle line:90%
that's not part of the agenda.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:44.736 align:middle line:84%
But I am here to see to it
that as many people know--

00:51:44.736 --> 00:51:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are you saying
that cold fusion is, again,

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:52.590 align:middle line:84%
trying-- the same powers that
be are trying to sequester,

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and I say powers with a
little p, lowercase p.

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Not genuinely powerful
beings, but we

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.600 align:middle line:90%
know who I'm talking about.

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Are they trying to--

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: When the Defense
Intelligence Agency--

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -sequester that
technology just for their--

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Anything
that's classified

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -own use?

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.816 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Anything I
think that's classified

00:52:06.816 --> 00:52:09.610 align:middle line:84%
that could benefit humanity
and stop war and do all

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:13.936 align:middle line:84%
these effects that we talk
about, that's horrible.

00:52:13.936 --> 00:52:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.410 align:middle line:90%
No, I agree.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And so is the impression you're
getting that this technology is

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:21.849 align:middle line:84%
going to continue being
cloaked until somehow--

00:52:21.849 --> 00:52:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: This is
what's going to happen.

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -a vast percentage of
the population has been reduced

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and it can be utilized by
the benefit of the few who

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.100 align:middle line:90%
continue?

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: What's
going to happen

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is it's going to
come out invisibly.

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it may
be out right now.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And it's going
to come out invisibly,

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's just going to
start showing up places.

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:39.785 align:middle line:90%
That I assure you of.

00:52:39.785 --> 00:52:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: That
will happen anyway

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and people won't even know that
it's around until a later time.

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:46.800 align:middle line:90%
That's going to happen anyway.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.362 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how
many people cut it,

00:52:49.362 --> 00:52:50.570 align:middle line:90%
that's what's going to occur.

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, and I indicated
this to you before,

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:57.440 align:middle line:84%
is that I would like
to start seeing to it

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that people in key
positions like Regina

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Dugan, former head of
DARPA, who's now at Google,

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:08.930 align:middle line:84%
address the utilization
of cold fusion

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:11.500 align:middle line:84%
with all the new tech
that's coming out.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.586 align:middle line:10%
And what she has
to say about it,

00:53:13.586 --> 00:53:15.960 align:middle line:10%
and how that's going to play
out with some of the biggest

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.795 align:middle line:10%
companies in the world that
are involved with this quietly.

00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
have her number?

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to interview her.

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: I've put feelers
out to arrange that because it's

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.980 align:middle line:84%
time that other people
start addressing this.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:29.813 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it is.

00:53:29.813 --> 00:53:31.050 align:middle line:90%
It's time for some of these--

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And seeing
what they have to say.

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -power
players to come forward.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Absolutely.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, any
final thoughts, James?

00:53:35.975 --> 00:53:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I just want to thank
you for taking the time,

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:39.493 align:middle line:90%
allowing me to come on here.

00:53:39.493 --> 00:53:41.427 align:middle line:84%
You know me well and
you know what I'm doing.

00:53:41.427 --> 00:53:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I do.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for doing
this because I, too,

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.720 align:middle line:84%
have been following the subject
since those first announcements

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.460 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago, and certainly
not to the degree you have.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And I very much
appreciate the journey

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:55.240 align:middle line:84%
you've been through
with all the cloaks

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.990 align:middle line:90%
and daggers and everything.

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Thanks a lot.

00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:59.831 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I, too,
have been following

00:53:59.831 --> 00:54:02.050 align:middle line:10%
this story, albeit casually,
for a couple of decades

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:04.270 align:middle line:10%
now in a state of
expectation for the beauty

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.990 align:middle line:10%
these new technologies
can bring to humanity.

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.187 align:middle line:10%
It seems it's just a
matter of time now.

00:54:09.187 --> 00:54:11.145 align:middle line:10%
