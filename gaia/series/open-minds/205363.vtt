[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:11.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Let's
go into the essence

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.440 align:middle line:10%
of five of the missing chapters,
and including this symbol.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVEN ROSS: I brought the
dream to Pearl, and she gasped.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:10%
She goes, oh, I think
Mr. Hall should see this.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:84%
He looks at me and
he goes, who are you?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:84%
It isn't about what political
party you belong to.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:84%
It isn't about what
religion you belong to.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: As we see society
losing its bearings in terms

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:10%
of discernment and
truth, we can find sanity

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:10%
in some of the ancient
mysteries of times past.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Manly P. Hall dedicated his
life to the preservation

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and perpetuation of
the great teachings

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
in his book, The Secret
Teachings of All Ages.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:10%
Our guest today, Stephen
Ross, spent time with Hall

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:10%
and had the profound
gift of being allowed

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:10%
into his private vault of
documents, where he found

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:10%
unknown works by Manly P. Hall.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is a big deal.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:84%
This is 1928, almost 100
years ago, when he wrote this.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
People don't understand,
Manly was a young man,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
but he was downloading from
other realms and lifetimes

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.760 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go into
how you ended up in his sphere

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and in his vaults, and then
surprise everybody with what

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:90%
follows.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Steven.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:10%
I always appreciate you
inviting me here and allowing

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:10%
me to share with your audience.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.845 align:middle line:84%
It's always so-- you know,
I always close my eyes

00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and take a little breath just
before the camera comes on.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you're
here, it's just

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
there's so much heart
energy, and besides all

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of massive
light around the top side.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
start in the late 1970s,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
when you went to a Friday
night lecture in Los Angeles.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where Manly P.
Hall centered his work.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Correct.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:10%
I really was introduced to
the esoteric metaphysical

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:10%
information in 1974.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:10%
And in 1978, someone
mentioned to me

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:10%
about a great philosopher, Manly
P. Hall, and his Philosophical

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:10%
Research Society, an incredible
place, 50,000 volumes

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:10%
with materials dated to BC.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So I wandered down to the
center on a Friday night Lyceum,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and there were about
70 people in this room.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Now I was not the
bravest of individuals

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.760 align:middle line:84%
with my math science
background in sports,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
wandering into a philosophy
place and esoteric.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So I did what I
did in that time.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I went way in the back,
sat in the last row.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
coward in your 20s.

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: There you go.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Just a fly on the wall.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the front of the
room was a blackboard.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.330 align:middle line:84%
There were six
sentences written.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the front were
three individuals

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:90%
who were the moderators.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
There was two gentlemen
who I later would find out

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
had followed Mr. Hall
for about 35 years,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and then a woman
named Pearl Thomas,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
who was the personal
librarian at the PRS.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And they would answer questions
of the previous Sunday's Mr.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Hall lecture.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Every Sunday he lectured.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Then the following Friday night.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They would discuss
six or seven points.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So the meeting was going along,
and somebody in the audience

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:84%
asked the moderators, what
about point number six?

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden Pearl Thomas
raises up her hand and points

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:84%
into the audience, and she
was pointing right at me.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And I could see people
shifting their position so she

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be pointing at them.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:90%
And the next thing I remember--

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the crowd
parted and the finger's

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:90%
pointing at you.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The seas
parted, and there it

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:90%
was, the finger pointed at me.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.329 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, what is this?

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:90%
But I ended up speaking.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:90%
I did not remember what I said.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
But when I finished,
everybody was looking at me.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happened after
that, the group broke up,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and I was looking to leave.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Pearl Thomas, who I found
out she was in her late 80s,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
had been with Mr.
Hall for 60 years.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:84%
She says to me, how long have
you been studying Mr. Hall?

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:90%
How many books have you read?

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, I've never
read any of his books.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, how many lectures
have you attended?

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I have never heard him lecture.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.697 align:middle line:90%
And she said to me, young man--

00:05:02.697 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
because I was young
then, back in the '70s--

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In your 20s, yeah.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Please
visit me tomorrow,

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Saturday, in the library.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So the next day I
go into the library.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Magnificent.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Regina, 50,000 books
all behind glass.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:84%
You would find a book,
talk to the librarian,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
she would open it with a
key, you would read it,

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:90%
and then it's returned.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So I spent that day in
this incredible place.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And then after my third visit,
Pearl Thomas said to me,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
you just open up, you
take the books out.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:90%
I trust you.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, that night I had a dream
and I wrote the dream down.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have had shows
before talking about dreams,

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:90%
and dreams have guided me.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So I brought the dream
to Pearl, and she gasps.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
She goes, oh, I think
Mr. Hall should see this.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So she apparently
gave it to Mr. Hall.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And three days
later, he calls me up

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
and invites me to visit him.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Now Mr. Hall was in such
demand that nobody really could

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:90%
get appointments with him.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And it was very funny
because people, I was told,

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.560 align:middle line:84%
would call and say, this is
Plato, this is Jesus Christ,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:90%
I would love to meet Mr. Hall.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So they were screaming, and
nobody was getting in there.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But he calls me
up, and I meet him.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And just as you and I are
looking at each other,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
he looks at me and
he goes, who are you?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's the
big fat question, isn't it?

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Who is Steven Ross?

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have some ideas.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But you are a
unique human being.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And I said,
I am a student.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:90%
And he said, why have you come?

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want to get
into your personal vault.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.048 align:middle line:90%
And he said, OK.

00:07:02.048 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just like that.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.048 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Just like that.

00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And the reason he did was
because his Philosophical

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Research Society
was built in 1934.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:84%
My dream was how he
wanted to build the PRS,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
but he did not
have enough money.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And he, of course--

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:90%
this would be in the 1920s--

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't born until
1949, so he knew

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:90%
there was no way I could know.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:84%
It was a calling card
from my spiritual sources

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that allowed me to go
into his personal vault,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:84%
not the 50,000 books,
but his personal vault,

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and xerox what I wanted to do,
with the proviso I would never

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%
sell any of those books that
I found in there while he

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
was alive because his society
was reprinting old books.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the point
was that he saw you,

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:84%
he saw you who you really
are, and he trusted you

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
because of the
ethics of your being,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and also the deep, deep,
deep knowledge that you

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:90%
bring through.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:90%
And you have.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been doing
this your whole life.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, that's
what happened that day.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:84%
When you say you don't
know what you said,

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
you streamed some apparently
pertinent information

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:84%
through that the
group took notice of.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And so he already knew because
he has the same abilities,

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.530 align:middle line:84%
so he was primed to meet
with you and to trust you.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So you started
photocopying, including

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:90%
ancient, ancient parchments.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And as I read in the
foreword of the book--

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
no, the introduction-- you
wrote that you actually

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
incurred some eyesight
damage at the time

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:90%
as a result of the photocopying.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Of course, because I was
taking books written in 1620,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
1650, 1700, walking out of the
vault, walking down a corridor

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and putting them
on a xerox machine,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
praying that the bindings
wouldn't break as I was

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:90%
xeroxing each page one by one.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
interesting story was

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:84%
when I did it the very first
time, the very first book,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I walk out of the vault.
And the business manager

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Philosophical
Research Society, this woman

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:90%
went nuclear.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
She had never seen or
heard of me before.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, what
are you doing,

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and literally grabbed
me by my collar.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put you in
the room with Mr. Hall.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, she put me in there.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.230 align:middle line:90%
He looks at me.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I look at him.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm just doing
what we discussed.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I walk out.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.565 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what she expected,
but I just looked at her.

00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thought you were
going to get a spanking.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I really
do believe that.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.110 align:middle line:90%
And I was a little uppity.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:90%
I was like that then.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But I just said, no, I'm
just going to continue.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
My eyes would kind
of be turned away,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:84%
but that xerox light,
I xeroxed about 30

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.560 align:middle line:84%
ancient alchemical texts,
some manuscripts that

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.900 align:middle line:90%
have never been printed.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.643 align:middle line:84%
With that opportunity, I really
was there about five months.

00:10:23.643 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, what's
amazing is, and we'll

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
get to that later, but you now
possess what someone called

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:84%
the new Manly P. Hall modern
day library because yours

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
is very similar, this incredible
library that you have.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.492 align:middle line:90%
We were talking off camera.

00:10:38.492 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
We've been friends
for a long time.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But book merchants
will come around

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and start salivating when they
see what you have in there,

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:90%
some of it under glass also.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Very, very ancient.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:54.145 align:middle line:84%
And so do you think that it
was your exposure to Manly P.

00:10:54.145 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Hall's library that really
gave you kind of the impetus

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and imbued you with
the desire to create

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
this library of your own,
this amazing material?

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: I would like to say yes.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that I always
had this innate feeling,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.363 align:middle line:84%
and I've also had numerous
past lives that I've been--

00:11:17.363 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A librarian?

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.483 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: A librarian.

00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:90%
How did you ever guess that?

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
call yourself a librarian.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I'm just a librarian,
but I have done it before.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what I did
pick up from Manly Hall.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Manly hall had
more books in print

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:84%
than any living author
while he was alive.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
saying something, including

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph Steiner and others.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:90%
It was the way that he wrote.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:84%
He never really wrote
books on phenomena.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
His goal was how
individuals could

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
live a more balanced, loving,
beautiful life because people

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:84%
can be into the phenomena,
but that doesn't

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:90%
mean that they're happy.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that they're healthy.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Manly Hall wrote with such
beauty on a variety of topics.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:84%
What I picked up from
him was the understanding

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't about how much an
individual knows that you meet.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It is how you unfold
within your own self.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And throughout all
of his writings,

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:84%
he never is encouraging
people to follow his way.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So what I picked up was just
an incredible understanding

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that all of these materials
that are written that are really

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:84%
of a profound nature are
encouraging individuals

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
to unfold and
unflower themselves.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:54.280 align:middle line:84%
There is too many egos
existing in this field, people

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
who will go and say,
oh, anybody can do it.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
listen to them,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:84%
they're encouraging you to have
to come to them because only

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:90%
they have the answer.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting to note
in the materials I learned

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
from Mr. Hall was where
he said, what I've written

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.960 align:middle line:84%
may seem contradictory
sometimes.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But everything, its intent is
to point you in a direction.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I am never going to give you
the answers, he would say.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But my intent is to point
you in the direction.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:90%
So I made a vow.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:84%
That is the strongest thing
that came out of my experience

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
My vow is to encourage
people to help

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
them see what their
own potential is,

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
to light up the area around
them and let you know everything

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:90%
that's possible for you.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Or another analogy I use is,
I'm like a bus stop bench.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:84%
People will come, will
share, but they're

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
going to go on their
bus route, and I'm

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:90%
going to go on my bus route.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But during that time,
we've exchanged.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:84%
That is what was
the most impactful.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And so the library that I have,
hopefully it's the same way.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
When people come,
what I tell them is,

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I am just going to talk
about different sections.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to keep
up with me as I circle.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to keep talking.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:32.380 align:middle line:84%
If something appeals to you,
you stop and you look at it,

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and I just go about
my way talking.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And they may be five bookcases
back in another section.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
These are the profound
people, I believe,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, Regina,
are the ones that don't

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:90%
encourage us to follow them.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They encourage us
to be within our own selves.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:90%
There is an old saying.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:84%
If we follow wise people,
we weaken ourselves.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:84%
But if we follow ourselves,
we become wise people.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very truly said.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into
this, what you

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:84%
were able to photograph in the
vault, has much of it come out?

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to talk
about some major information

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that was in that vault
that's just now coming out,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:84%
literally 92 years
after it was written.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.212 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was there quite
a bit of that in there?

00:15:28.212 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, some of
the old alchemical books

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:90%
have been reprinted now.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
When I did the
xeroxing in '78, '79.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:90%
We just didn't have that.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Now quite a lot of
reprints come out of India,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and they come out with
beautiful leather binding

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:90%
and they're very inexpensive.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's good because
I'm a very firm believer,

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I would rather have a photocopy
of ancient information

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:90%
if I can't have the original.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the original,
it's about the information.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And quite a few of those
have been reprinted.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Manly Hall died in 1990.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I might have jumped on a
lot of reprinting of some

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.690 align:middle line:90%
of the alchemical texts.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But that's not where I was
coming from at the time.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
But what really attracted
me was none of the books,

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:31.990 align:middle line:84%
but a little notebook that
said, Last Second Material

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Arrived Too Late to Be Included
in the Secret Teaching Book.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:84%
The book, "The Secret
Teaching of All Ages",

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:84%
which is magnum opus,
was the greatest book

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
of all the books
Manly Hall wrote.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:90%
So that really attracted me.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to say that
my spiritual sources

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.880 align:middle line:84%
that led me to say, I want to
go into your private vault,

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.873 align:middle line:90%
directed me to--

00:16:59.873 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To that
notebook for a reason.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all, let's
just take the big boy up,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:90%
"Secret Teaching of All Ages".

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:90%
And this book is--

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:90%
it's so beautiful.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.839 align:middle line:84%
So this one we
found, for example,

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
is the image of as
above, so below.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:10%
And the way he
was able to depict

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:10%
this in the magnificent artwork
embedded with the symbolism

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.670 align:middle line:10%
is as important as the text.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And in this notebook
that the information was not

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%
included, people have
bought this book, which

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:84%
was published in 1928, and they
have just read it straight.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But in the series of lectures
that Manly gave in 1928, which

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
were not included
in this book, he

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
speaks about how he envisioned
people reading this book,

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and how they were to approach
this book chapter by chapter,

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:90%
symbol by symbol.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
this material very, very

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:84%
important that I did
find in his vault,

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:84%
was that it was talking about
the true intent of the book.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Now when a book
comes out, you would

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:84%
believe the true
intent is somebody

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:84%
is sharing information, and
we're satisfied with that.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
But when somebody has writings
about the deeper reasons

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:84%
why the book has
been written, you

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:90%
would really want to know that.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.572 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's the key.

00:18:36.572 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It is the key.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I found
in these materials is

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:50.200 align:middle line:84%
his key of saying not only
how to approach the book,

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:84%
but within here saying,
the italicized words

00:18:54.490 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
are leading to a mark and
part of the inner teachings

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:90%
of the inner teachings.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is very, very
profound from an individual

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
who had the awareness and
knowledge that Manly Hall had.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:84%
He would give lectures
that he charged $1.00,

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:84%
the first time he lectured
until his last lecture.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:84%
When they're typed out,
they're 15 pages single spaced,

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:90%
and he never used notes.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:90%
That was like Steiner.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Just streamed it,
just streamed it.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And so here,
when he's talking

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:84%
about the big book
and these materials,

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.060 align:middle line:84%
for those individuals
who are not only into him

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and have got the
book, but people

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
who are studying and
learning in this field,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:90%
it's very important to have.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So essentially
what he was saying

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:84%
is that if you read this
book with the understanding

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that when you see
italicized words or phrases,

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:90%
you're being given a symbol.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes
deeper by saying

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:84%
people are not
really understanding

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:15.170 align:middle line:90%
what symbols are meant to do.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:84%
There is a little bit more to
symbols than people realize.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.080 align:middle line:84%
The ancients set up the
symbols in their time

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
to evoke things having to do
with the mind, the spirit.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Access
between dimensions.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened is over
time, when people start

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:84%
attaching their
analysis of a symbol,

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
it starts changing from what
those original symbols really

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
were meant to be sharing with
individuals who would be gazing

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's about how
we observe anything

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:90%
that is very important.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And basically what
these pages were,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Manly Hall intended to put the
pages here into the big book.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't able to
get in because they arrived

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:90%
at the printer too late.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So then he thought,
OK, I have some pages.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I might as well turn
them into lectures.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So here we have 20
lectures elaborating

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:84%
further upon where he might
have had one page in the book,

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:84%
there's now three or four pages
with a more full-blown lecture

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:90%
on a particular topic.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is not edited.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
This is in his original,
typewritten on a typewriter

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:90%
documents.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Exactly how I found it.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:84%
What I did was I
put an introduction.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I have not even commented
on any of the materials

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:84%
other than what you
and I are doing now,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:84%
purely because I don't think
we should always accept

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:84%
somebody else's
analysis, what they

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:90%
believe something is saying.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
talking about something

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that is really more a matter of
consumption versus engagement.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think we are a
consumptive species right now.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:90%
We've been led to be consumers.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's a kind of a
double-edged sword

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
in a way, in that you have
all this incredible ability

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:84%
to access ancient
teachings of all kinds

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.290 align:middle line:84%
from throughout the ages
because of the internet.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to do snail
mail way because of libraries,

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.130 align:middle line:84%
the one or two in the world
that exist like yours,

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.170 align:middle line:90%
people can get that information.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It's there for us
to engage with.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But instead, it's easy,
oftentimes, to say, oh--

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I fall prey to it.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm guilty of it myself.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.965 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I saw an interview
with so-and-so.

00:22:49.965 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:90%
That was really cool.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to incorporate
that into my own stuff.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy to do that.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to actually
sit down and take the time

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:84%
to engage to where
your life becomes

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.770 align:middle line:84%
this more fulsome expression
of these principles.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And what I would
love for your audience

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
to get out of this show is
that they trust themselves,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:84%
that they recognize that
wisdom comes from experience,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:90%
wisdom comes from a lifestyle.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:84%
This is why, when we
look at these ancients

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and call them wise,
it is because they

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:84%
didn't all of a sudden
wake up and they were wise.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It was how they
lived their life,

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:84%
how they observed nature,
not only of the world,

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.740 align:middle line:90%
but the nature of people.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
What somebody should
get out of our sharing

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:84%
is to trust themselves,
to be observant,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize
knowledge and belief.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is when you
have firsthand contact

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.290 align:middle line:90%
with something.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it's a belief.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone watching
this has their own divine genius

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and beauty and is looking for
that core truth in themselves.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
one doorway to it.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into--
you're going to share

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:84%
with us the essence of five
of the missing chapters,

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
obviously not the whole thing,
and including symbolism,

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and including one primal
symbol, which ironically,

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed another
man named Robert Gilbert,

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and he really focused on this
Manly P. Hall symbol, which

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
is this symbol, the hermetic
symbol, the Egyptian symbol,

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
the circle with the
dot at the center.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:90%
That's one of them.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do that, but we'll
do a few others as well.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the nature
of that kind of symbolism.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Manly Hall used the
example of all existence

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:84%
as a piece of
paper with the idea

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that the paper just
went on endlessly,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.350 align:middle line:90%
and it's completely blank.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And the dot he
identified as God,

00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:84%
or the first aspect coming out
of the void of nothingness.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And he goes on to talk about
a dot, a line, and a circle.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And he ties in that
original dot with what he

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:90%
considers absolute philosophy.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:90%
There's absolute philosophy.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:90%
There's relative philosophy.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:10%
For him, absolute philosophy
was a total understanding

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.830 align:middle line:10%
and awareness of whatever.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:84%
You are going to
the actual source

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:36.790 align:middle line:84%
of whatever something might
be, the cause, not the effect.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:84%
As you go from this dot
and you make a line,

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.560 align:middle line:90%
you have something in action.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And in action is already
coming from out of that dot,

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:84%
out of the cause, and you now
are working towards an effect.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And so in a very easy way in
four pages, which I certainly

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.520 align:middle line:84%
can't do in two
minutes, the idea

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:84%
is that these symbols
are representative

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:84%
of what takes place
not only in the world,

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
but within an individual, and
within an individual's mind,

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and within an individual's
even spiritual essence.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:90%
That dot is the original aspect.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Some people may call
it the hermetic secret,

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.430 align:middle line:90%
the alchemical secret.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But it is a place that you
want to be going towards.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Rather than being on the line
where you're going in action,

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:84%
you are going back to
a place of inaction.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But this is representative in
other cultures, whether it's

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism, where you quiet
yourself down, meditation.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:90%
It isn't about the action.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.060 align:middle line:84%
It isn't about what political
party you belong to.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:84%
It isn't about what
religion you belong to.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.325 align:middle line:90%
You don't take those with you.

00:27:03.325 --> 00:27:07.000 align:middle line:90%
You take the essences with you.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
You take what you
learn with you.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But you don't take any kind
of material aspects with you.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.190 align:middle line:84%
This is going in line
with exactly what

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:19.570 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The more that people stress
and look at the activity

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
that they're involved
with, the further away

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.603 align:middle line:84%
they are getting from
where they need to be.

00:27:32.603 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The essence.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Absolutely,
because people need

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:90%
to ask a fundamental question.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.240 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose
that I am alive

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:90%
and breathing in this reality?

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:90%
There is another area.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of skipped
right through to the real,

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:84%
like I said, primal
essence of symbolism.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the other chapters
is on agents and elements

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.580 align:middle line:90%
used to perpetuate knowledge.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And we're going to get
right back again because it's

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:90%
all about symbols.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:84%
It is about what you do
when you see a symbol.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.160 align:middle line:84%
The original intent
by the ancients,

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:29.260 align:middle line:84%
anybody who creates a symbol, is
to invoke much deeper awareness

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:90%
than most people would think.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Now you look at a symbol,
you go, oh, it's McDonald's.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.433 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's the Rosicrucian.

00:28:37.433 --> 00:28:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's the hermetic.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chanel.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It's Chanel.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.570 align:middle line:90%
That's surface dwelling.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:84%
But the original
formation of these symbols

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:55.240 align:middle line:84%
evokes responses very, very deep
within an individual's psyche.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So the key, what
you just read there,

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:84%
is these symbols,
when you really

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:84%
discern, when you observe
them, when you discern them,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:84%
when you really take the time--
people say it's like mandalas.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah, you
allow your whole field

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.550 align:middle line:84%
to be open to it without
expectation or projection.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And the secret of
this is, and what

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Manly Hall did in his big book,
and what he elaborated here,

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:29.670 align:middle line:90%
was approach it wide open.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And this was something that
I've been very lucky in my life.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And probably you've
experienced this, too.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.192 align:middle line:84%
Somebody with some
topic will come to you

00:29:40.192 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:90%
and they'll start explaining.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.830 align:middle line:84%
They go, you probably
already know this.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're speaking
about some nuclear physics.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.333 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
they're talking about.

00:29:48.333 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:90%
But here's what they'll say.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
They'll go, you already
know this, so I'm sorry.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, I may not know it.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:00.058 align:middle line:84%
And even things I do know,
when I am with somebody new--

00:30:00.058 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't know
it the way they know it.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And I will
just approach this

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.980 align:middle line:84%
as I am going to
listen to everything

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:90%
you're sharing with me.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.820 align:middle line:90%
I know nothing.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Once they've
finished, then I can

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.710 align:middle line:84%
let my whatever, wisdom,
knowledge, bubble up, and say,

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.140 align:middle line:90%
wow, I had heard this.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I assumed that.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is listening
today to other people.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is bringing us
further and further away--

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From the dot.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even in science now,
Manjir Samanta-Laughton,

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:43.680 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful M.D.,
former M.D., in Britain

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.340 align:middle line:84%
who had her own experiences,
kind of like Nassim Haramein

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:90%
on the subject of black holes.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And it just hit her one day.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.370 align:middle line:84%
She just saw it all,
and that now there's

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.370 align:middle line:84%
more and more evidence
for the truth of this, is

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.680 align:middle line:84%
they're starting to understand
black holes a little better.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
sucks the life out of it.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.500 align:middle line:84%
These are the points, the
centers of all creation,

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're even at the center
of the cells of our body,

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.620 align:middle line:84%
constantly receiving
information,

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.868 align:middle line:84%
and then, as you say,
outputting into whatever

00:31:13.868 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:90%
that mind is into effect.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And that is a
beautiful image of Manly Hall.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:84%
As above, so below, that
it reiterates constantly

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:84%
from the mundane world which we
are in to the spiritual world.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:32.470 align:middle line:84%
It is all reiterated
over and over again.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is the part
that I find beautiful about it,

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:41.790 align:middle line:84%
is the multidimensionality of
it, in that if a black hole,

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:46.530 align:middle line:84%
or that point, the
dot, is the essence,

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
meaning the pure flow of the
original information coming

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.450 align:middle line:84%
forth from us, from
ourselves, from the universe,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:59.340 align:middle line:90%
from the great godheads--

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.010 align:middle line:84%
this is coming through many
dimensions, not just ours.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from this
incredible planum of all.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And we represent
that, every one of us.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in our
body represents that.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.553 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And could
be, if we're open,

00:32:13.553 --> 00:32:16.530 align:middle line:84%
if we're healthy, if we have
an open attitude, receiving

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.590 align:middle line:84%
impulses even through
the cells of our being

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of this interdimensional,
multidimensional information.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.737 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: You need to be
telling the world this.

00:32:26.737 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You already are.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean, it's just,
to me, beautiful.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.460 align:middle line:90%
That's how I view life.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And I view the notion of this
point of these black holes.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And Manly P. Hall's--

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:84%
essentially, you
can go all through

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.695 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful drawings
and all the symbolism.

00:32:45.695 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:84%
But what does it
really come down

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to in terms of this
creative force that

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:54.840 align:middle line:84%
exists throughout the universe
and throughout humanity?

00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: He mentioned the
book is only a gateway.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.210 align:middle line:90%
This is only a gateway.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Now it's interesting,
again, would have been nice

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.440 align:middle line:84%
if he had put that
in the introduction

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:90%
of his actual book.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But he says it in
1928 to this group.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many people
were in attendance for these 20

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:90%
lectures.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:21.400 align:middle line:84%
He did it over 21 days
one night after another.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's really remarkable.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But he said, don't expect this
book is not going to give you

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.940 align:middle line:90%
the immediate answers.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:90%
It is merely a gateway.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I hope my
life will mean to others

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.470 align:middle line:90%
is it's only a gateway.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're allowed to do this
when somebody comes and says,

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Steve, why is it you
and I buy our shoes

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:84%
at the same shoe store, but
your feet don't seem to hurt?

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:56.238 align:middle line:84%
What they're saying is,
what is your philosophy

00:33:56.238 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:84%
when you are going
through the same things,

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.670 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
seem to bother you?

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:04.470 align:middle line:84%
This is when people open the
door, and then we can share--

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.130 align:middle line:84%
for me, it's more LEFL, which
is laughter, excitement, fun,

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:08.969 align:middle line:90%
and love--

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:84%
but to get people there, you
have to kind of convince them

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.960 align:middle line:84%
because they think
everything has ended because

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.780 align:middle line:90%
of the politics right now.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.389 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say
it's challenging,

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:25.940 align:middle line:84%
but people should not lose who
they are and where they are

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.480 align:middle line:90%
and what is truly going on now.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.300 align:middle line:84%
This has been a
big wake-up call.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it wouldn't have
happened if all of the tumblers

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:84%
didn't come to create
what we have now.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it
absolutely had to happen.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:44.659 align:middle line:84%
And as other channeled works by
people that I know and talk to

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:46.489 align:middle line:84%
and have done
interviews with say,

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:48.290 align:middle line:90%
this is the time of the ages.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.389 align:middle line:84%
It's been thousands
of years since you've

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:54.889 align:middle line:84%
had such an amazing opportunity
and opening to now shift upward

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:56.810 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your
consciousness and the way

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:59.115 align:middle line:84%
you want to have a
sustainable planetary life.

00:34:59.115 --> 00:34:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes, exactly.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is the time.

00:35:01.115 --> 00:35:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we have to
employ that incredible truth.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I want to get back to one
point in here before we go on.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the other points

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.500 align:middle line:84%
that you feel free
sharing with us

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.340 align:middle line:84%
is relationship existing
between the substance of mind

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and the substance of spirit.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Explain that a
little bit for us.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: What Manly
Hall went on to say

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:29.480 align:middle line:84%
here is the understanding
that one's mind is not really

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.060 align:middle line:90%
who they are.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.890 align:middle line:84%
People just assume, all
of us, our ego, our mind

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:37.790 align:middle line:90%
is who we are.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our thoughts.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.235 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Our thoughts.

00:35:39.235 --> 00:35:40.850 align:middle line:90%
That is who we are.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And the substance of
the mind is physical.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:52.970 align:middle line:84%
The mind and the spirit
are vastly different.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And the mind can be
looked at as clothing

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.850 align:middle line:84%
that we put on in a particular
living along with the ego

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.560 align:middle line:90%
that we accept.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.313 align:middle line:84%
And ego, by the way,
is not a bad thing.

00:36:05.313 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
a sense of identity.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
who have said,

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get rid of my ego.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.020 align:middle line:90%
And I have to share with them--

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a sense of who
and what you will collectively

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.540 align:middle line:90%
have become.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.390 align:middle line:84%
What you really
are asking is, you

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.910 align:middle line:90%
want to spiritualize your ego.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you didn't have an
ego, you wouldn't be existing.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:28.370 align:middle line:90%
So the substance of the spirit--

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:32.870 align:middle line:84%
now again, the symbols
can be accepted just

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.360 align:middle line:84%
by the substance
of the mind, what

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:42.800 align:middle line:84%
the mind has been conditioned to
remember, what it has observed.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Then the mind will
look at a symbol

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and quickly interpret exactly
how you've just said it.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, black hole
really means this.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:55.490 align:middle line:84%
But the substance of the
spirit is more encompassing.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we observe from
our spiritual essence

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and look at things that we look
at all the time with our mind,

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.620 align:middle line:90%
it is vastly different.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.520 align:middle line:84%
When one is perceiving
or apperceiving

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:84%
the essence, the light
beings that we are,

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.890 align:middle line:84%
they are not as inclined to
look at the substance, which

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:84%
is the color, the
hair, or no hair.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.040 align:middle line:84%
They are looking
at pure essence.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:84%
The substance of the spirit
is bringing us to essence.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:38.420 align:middle line:84%
The substance of the mind
is generally physical,

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:90%
the size, the color.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.490 align:middle line:90%
We want to look beyond that.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And if we were looking
at that, this world

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.960 align:middle line:84%
would be quite
different than it is

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.710 align:middle line:84%
right now because we
have actually taken 10

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:90%
steps backward, in my opinion.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:02.510 align:middle line:84%
There is more segmenting,
more separation, more

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
taking it away, forgetting that
everybody bleeds the same color

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.890 align:middle line:84%
right now, which is not
the light of the spirit,

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:12.350 align:middle line:84%
but that is still a
physical substance.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Hey, we're of the same blood.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.720 align:middle line:90%
But we're just far away.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So the substance of
mind, the substance

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.640 align:middle line:90%
is spirit are vastly different.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:90%
And we can arrive there.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So the substance
of spirit goes back

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:84%
to the essences of objects,
of people, of nature.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
this lecture that he

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:44.060 align:middle line:84%
gave was trying to present
to people, that yes,

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:84%
the conditioning is you
look at it from your mind.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Where you want to get back to
is the essence of the spirit.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The substance of
spirit is light,

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and you want to be
apperceiving everything

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.340 align:middle line:90%
in its light essence.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So beautifully said.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And Steven, we brought this up
in other shows, but all of this

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:13.692 align:middle line:84%
comes into the abilities
that we will understand--

00:39:13.692 --> 00:39:15.150 align:middle line:84%
we should understand
now, in fact--

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.220 align:middle line:84%
that we all innately
possess that we will

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.310 align:middle line:90%
be expressing in the future.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.730 align:middle line:84%
The material world is
not what we think it is.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.620 align:middle line:90%
It's immaterial in nature.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.160 align:middle line:84%
How are our minds and our
hearts and our emotions function

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.210 align:middle line:84%
can program outcomes that have
a material effect, but are

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.800 align:middle line:90%
of a nonmaterial nature.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And this-- I've said this
before in other shows--

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.560 align:middle line:84%
you developed
somewhere along the way

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:84%
the ability to assist people
in their healing process, which

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
is very condensed
and quick process

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.460 align:middle line:84%
you go to if a person
sincerely wishes to reverse

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.355 align:middle line:90%
the imbalance in their body.

00:39:52.355 --> 00:39:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And you've dealt with many,
many, many, many, many people

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.310 align:middle line:84%
in every single
kind of condition.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: But you know why?

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.805 align:middle line:90%
Because I love them.

00:39:58.805 --> 00:40:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You love
them, exactly.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.210 align:middle line:84%
You have this heart that I
said at the very beginning.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.450 align:middle line:84%
You have this heart energy
that comes out and meets

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.190 align:middle line:84%
with their desire
to be whole again.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And in that, you work
through nonmaterial means,

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:15.660 align:middle line:84%
pure information, pure
space, like a black hole,

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.530 align:middle line:84%
reprogram it, and health
resumes in these people.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what we're
talking about directly.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:84%
That is the extension
of what we're all

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.880 align:middle line:84%
capable of if we can understand
the essence of our true nature,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.660 align:middle line:84%
which is one thing
we're capable of.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And again, why I think this
is pertinent is if somebody

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:40.410 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
pointing the way, you

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:45.780 align:middle line:84%
would want them to point you in
the safest direction possible

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.580 align:middle line:84%
that will get you
where you want to go.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:52.650 align:middle line:84%
That is, again, why I have
admired Manly Hall's material,

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:84%
is he is doing in its pure
form rather than saying,

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.975 align:middle line:84%
well, OK, I read this,
and this is what I feel,

00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:02.850 align:middle line:90%
and I'm pointing you.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:05.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:10.320 align:middle line:84%
This just pure, this is
what you want to go towards.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.650 align:middle line:84%
It is, again, when I talk
about an example of Plato

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.260 align:middle line:90%
and Aristotle.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle's complaint
with Plato was

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.140 align:middle line:84%
he's not telling you
exactly how to get,

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:27.030 align:middle line:84%
if the end result
is this glass, Plato

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:30.660 align:middle line:84%
would just be telling you, you
want to arrive at this glass.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.940 align:middle line:84%
For Aristotle in the
scientific approach,

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.720 align:middle line:84%
it's how exactly
do you get there?

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He wants
the mechanical model

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:35.910 align:middle line:90%
for how you get there.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.118 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: How do you get there?

00:41:37.118 --> 00:41:40.140 align:middle line:84%
How many miles, how many
feet, how many inches?

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Then you are locked into
that particular approach.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy-- Manly Hall
is not the only one--

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:49.550 align:middle line:84%
there's other great
philosophers--

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:54.090 align:middle line:84%
the less that they put
their own spin on something.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And now let's go into even
what's happening in the world.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:03.280 align:middle line:84%
If each one of these stations
puts their own spin, all we do

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.080 align:middle line:90%
is spin.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.060 align:middle line:84%
You turn the TV, you
get this channel.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.477 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone's
spinning out.

00:42:07.477 --> 00:42:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It's spinning,
spinning, spinning, spinning.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.150 align:middle line:84%
You know what somebody
should go down to?

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Empathy, love.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this sounds
trite, but if people

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:19.170 align:middle line:84%
are claiming that
they're religious,

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.570 align:middle line:90%
go back to the teachings.

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Empathy, love.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Help thy neighbor.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Now ask yourself, one should
ask themselves, who is doing it,

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.220 align:middle line:90%
and am I doing it?

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is something,
too, when you're

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.140 align:middle line:84%
talking about the notion of
putting the principle out

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and letting people
take it as they will,

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.160 align:middle line:84%
this is something that
came up in an interview I

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.280 align:middle line:84%
did with the Theo Group
recently, with Sheila Gillette

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.720 align:middle line:90%
and talked to those beings.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And some people
took offense at it

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:50.310 align:middle line:84%
because they were
in personal pain.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:55.090 align:middle line:84%
They said, this is a magnificent
period of human history.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:58.980 align:middle line:84%
This is your opportunity to
use everything you've learned,

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.250 align:middle line:84%
your creativity, and
your innate intellect

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and work together to now
create the kind of world you

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:06.730 align:middle line:90%
want to live in.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And people were
like, yeah, well,

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:08.770 align:middle line:90%
what are we supposed to do?

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:10.395 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't
tell us what to do.

00:43:10.395 --> 00:43:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Missed the point.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:15.060 align:middle line:84%
The point is for you to
employ these things in you

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and join with others to
create this new world the way

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.260 align:middle line:90%
you want to see it.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And people don't realize
"The Ancient Teachings"

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:90%
says we are all creators.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:33.090 align:middle line:84%
We are down here to demonstrate
how we manage creative energy.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:34.590 align:middle line:90%
We are creators.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:38.640 align:middle line:84%
We can create our world in
the way that we want to.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Someone may say, well,
but this is happening.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.150 align:middle line:84%
No, it's your
perception and how you

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:48.570 align:middle line:84%
handle what is happening
that is going to reflect

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.790 align:middle line:90%
what the outcome is for you.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And it's always
going to be that case.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Steven, any final thoughts,
because we're just about

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:90%
out of time.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: What happened?

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, good question.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.802 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: How is that
possible, Regina?

00:44:03.802 --> 00:44:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
happened, and here we are,

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to
recover ourselves.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Instead of waiting
for other people

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to dictate what our world's
going to look like, what we're

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.190 align:middle line:84%
going to salvage
from it, what looks

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:17.910 align:middle line:84%
similar to how it was before
and what still exists now--

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:middle line:84%
instead, going to
that center point

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and figuring out who we are
and how we want to participate.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.090 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's critical.

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:90%
That's everything.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I would say.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:33.510 align:middle line:10%
And I would like people to leave
right now with this thought.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.270 align:middle line:10%
Everything is possible.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.340 align:middle line:10%
We are creators.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.840 align:middle line:10%
And the more that we accent
the positive, the more positive

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.780 align:middle line:10%
the world will become.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amen, my friend.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being here, Steven.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.723 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Again, thank you.

00:44:50.723 --> 00:44:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll
be able to access

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.630 align:middle line:84%
this information for yourself
in Steven's new book he just

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:58.080 align:middle line:84%
mentioned, "Unpublished
Pages of the Secret Teachings

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.418 align:middle line:90%
of All Ages".

00:44:59.418 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:10%
And if you enjoyed
this conversation,

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.600 align:middle line:10%
you're probably going to enjoy
our other talks here on Gaia.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.070 align:middle line:10%
Just look for them
in the archives.

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.987 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:45:06.987 --> 00:45:08.100 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds".
