00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Throughout
the history of Earth,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:84%
there's been little of more
curiosity than visitations

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:90%
from beings from outer space.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:84%
This phenomena appears
to be increasing

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.210 align:middle line:84%
around the world at this time,
such as the New Year's Eve 2014

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:90%
sightings in the United States.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:84%
ETs also reach out
through other means

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and have been connecting with
humans since the beginning.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Tom Moore is one such contactee.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:84%
His thirst for
knowledge has given us

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
a look not only at an ET species
from Sirius B but the larger

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:90%
agenda with Earth's visitations.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
He's with us today to tell us
an absolutely amazing tale.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Tom.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TOM MOORE: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I so
enjoyed your book.

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I think I had every other page
dog-eared because it's so--

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:90%
for me, this is fun.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing scary about it.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just fun to think of
the possibilities of who else

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:90%
is out there.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And we have enough evidence now,
from ancient, ancient history

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:84%
through to visitations such
as what you experienced,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
to show us that we're seeing
only a sliver of reality.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
let's talk about how

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.435 align:middle line:84%
you came in contact with
the being you call Antura--

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
or who identified himself as
Antura-- who is from Sirius B

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and has explained
about what life

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
is like there and with
other civilizations.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Antura I began communicating
with telepathically.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, I defined telepathy
as communication

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
between two beings,
not between two people.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And I had been communicating
telepathically with my own

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:90%
what I call a guardian angel.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
And his name is Theo.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And one day, Theo and I were
talking about ruins in Europe

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:90%
that were Sirian in nature.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you'll get
to see those one day.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, great.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:90%
And then I started thinking.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you mean you
as people or you personally?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.750 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, you personally.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh,
that's interesting.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:90%
And he went on to say, yes.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
He says, a friend of yours
from a planet in the Sirius B

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:90%
is tuning into us now.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, after my jaw dropped
because I thought here

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I was having a
private conversation

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:90%
with my own guardian angel.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And here I'm on a party line,
and somebody else is tuning in.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you want
to talk to him now?

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me think of some questions
and I'll get back with him.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And so about two weeks later,
I had a list of questions.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it started.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I
didn't have his name.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea of
what he looked like.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was going
to look like Earth people

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
because I'd always heard that
the first contacts that people

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
would have would be people that
would look exactly like us.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we will get
to that part of the story

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:84%
because there's still
belief that that

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:90%
may occur that way, yes.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me ask
you one question.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.020 align:middle line:84%
As you were trying to suss
out what he looked like and so

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:84%
forth, you asked a
lot of questions.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:84%
What I appreciated
about your book--

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:84%
there is another channel I have
known for many, many years,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:90%
from 30 years ago.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And the person asking questions
through that particular person

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to the entity asked very,
very similar questions

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:90%
as to what you answered.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there were some
similar answers that came back.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So I really love that thirst and
that curiosity that you have.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But just a slight
diversion-- what

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:84%
were the sites, the
Sirian B sites that they

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:90%
were referring to?

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: They were just talking
about some ruins that were--

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was it Egypt, or--

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.929 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: In existence in Europe.

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see, in Europe?

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, interesting.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to catch that
before blow on past it.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what you learned

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
about the life and the
inhabitants, the lifestyle,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:90%
the nature of the planet.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously
you can go on a bit.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to hear this part
of the tale about these people

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%
on Sirius B.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.050 align:middle line:84%
First of all, again,
I thought that he

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:90%
would look just like us.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But when I started asking
these questions and he said,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
now, Tom, I'm under
the same rules

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
that Theo is under-- that you
can ask any question of me,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:90%
and I'll answer it.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But you have to ask
specific questions.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.841 align:middle line:84%
You can't just say,
well, describe the plan.

00:04:53.841 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, which
is common with beings

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:90%
from other dimensions.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.383 align:middle line:84%
They aren't going to just go
on a diatribe of some kind.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: No.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to think
of individual questions.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And this went over
many, many months

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
as I came up with these
hundreds of questions.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I
found out, to my surprise

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.390 align:middle line:90%
was that he didn't look like us.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:84%
He's an amphibian, and he lives
on a water world in the Sirius

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:90%
B solar system.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's like 22
planets in the solar system

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about yet.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And his planet is the
third from the sun.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:90%
But it is hotter on the surface.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But only 10% of
this planet is land,

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:90%
and all the rest is ocean.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And his people
live-- their cities

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:90%
are at a depth of 5,000 feet.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And he says their bodies are
more like a fish than a human

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
so that they can swim at
these very, very deep depths.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we got into cities
looking like bubble cities that

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of water
inside and outside.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.105 align:middle line:90%
But they did have dry spaces.

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you talked to him

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit about
their physical makeup.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And you kept saying,
do you have gills?

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.394 align:middle line:90%
I remember you asked that.

00:06:19.394 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:84%
So you really wanted
to get this answer.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%
But their skin was
more dolphin-like,

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
as I remember you were
saying-- a little more

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.839 align:middle line:84%
smooth and rubbery,
more of a blue tint?

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes, blue.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.324 align:middle line:90%
He said, we're beautiful.

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Blue is beautiful.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah, right.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.178 align:middle line:90%
He was very positive about that.

00:06:37.178 --> 00:06:38.049 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
shape of their head

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
tends to come around and more
to more of a point in the back?

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Is that kind of how it looks.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.018 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah, kind of.

00:06:46.018 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it did seem to
be more of a point.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And they only have one gill
behind their ear, which

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:90%
I thought was very interesting.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.295 align:middle line:84%
You always think everything
would be symmetrical.

00:06:56.295 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:90%
You know, two gills.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And they only have one
very sort of dainty gill

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:90%
that is behind an ear.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
they developed.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They can be on land.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's not basically
a land-based planet.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And how long can
they stay on land

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.215 align:middle line:84%
before they really need to
get back into the water?

00:07:21.215 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: I think
they just really

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
don't enjoy being on land
for long periods of time.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I found out was

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
that they have these force field
devices that take care of them

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:90%
in any kind of environment.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:90%
And they're the size of a pin.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they could walk on
the moon, as an example,

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and not have a problem with
these force field devices

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.070 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.334 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It modulates
the personal environment

00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
around them so that
they're comfortable enough

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:90%
to survive it.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And it's just
the devices have shrunk

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
over millions of years to
these tiny, tiny devices, just

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:84%
as our devices-- cell
phones and everything--

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
they're all smaller.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Every two years it
goes by half down.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So we're heading
along that path.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found it interesting
that they were talking

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
about the under-the-sea
cities they live in.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying
over and over-- they're

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
just like someone
who likes cupcakes.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It comes up in almost
every conversation, right?

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:84%
He was always talking
about how much

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
he loves the water, how much
they enjoy the water, how

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:90%
beautiful the water is.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And so water was-- and it sounds
like even in their underground

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:90%
city environments--

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.346 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: They have pools
that they can jump in.

00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have
an airlock of sorts

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:84%
like you would almost
see in a sci-fi movie?

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Right.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
strange, when I first

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
started doing my
meditation process,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:84%
when I first
started out, I would

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:84%
imagine myself going down
these old steps and diving

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
into the sea and swimming down
to a city underneath the water

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and going through an airlock
and using a white towel

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
to wipe off, and then
going from there.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:90%
So it was really--

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of us who-- people

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
who have flying dreams also
often have underwater dreams.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And for me, for my
entire lifetime,

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I've had these underwater dreams
where, for various reasons,

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:90%
I end up under water.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:90%
But in this, there isn't a gill.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
cilia in the nose act

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.980 align:middle line:84%
as some sort of
filtration unit that

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
separates the oxygen
from the hydrogen

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and allows me to
breathe very gently

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:84%
underwater without
any apparatus.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the dreams, it
feels totally normal.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Right.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:90%
And I used to scuba dive.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I felt
like I could almost

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:90%
breathe underwater.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Almost more
comfortable underwater.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
have that sensation, that

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, now there are so many
questions about that.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about their
societal and family structures

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:90%
on Sirius, for one.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.220 align:middle line:90%
They do have families.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
He has a mate and
he has two boys

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.416 align:middle line:84%
that he calls his
little tadpoles.

00:10:21.416 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cute.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: It's cute.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.585 align:middle line:84%
And because they live
such long lives--

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long
a life do they live?

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Uh, 1,200 to
1,500 universal years.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And you multiply a universal
year by 10 for Earth years.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Our time has been
speeded up for us.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, so
over 100,000 years

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.753 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking
at it on our clock.

00:10:45.753 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Well, no.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.870 align:middle line:90%
10,000.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.556 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean 10,000.

00:10:49.556 --> 00:10:50.056 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Yeah, 10,000 to
15,000 years our time.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So they typically
don't expect to be

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.799 align:middle line:84%
with the same mate for all
that 1,200 or 1,500 years.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: God, can you imagine?

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
We have a hard enough
time with 10 or 20.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Certainly 10,000 or 15,000-

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: But everybody's
very friendly.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Things are very, very peaceful.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're just an
extremely peaceful people.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And when they first inhabited
this water planet, which

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
was 18 million years
ago, they started out

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.610 align:middle line:90%
existing more in caves.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And as they progressed, they
started building these cities

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:90%
on top of the caves.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to somehow be
taken into one of their cities,

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:84%
you could actually
go down farther

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and find the original
caves that they lived in.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And they had this one
huge whale-like monster

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:90%
that loved to eat on them.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they said,
we would always

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:90%
keep well away from that guy.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they procreate the
same way we do, it sounds like,

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
except in a much higher
standard of connection.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Yes, but when I ask
him, do you have a penis?

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, well--
but they retract it

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
when they're swimming
to cut down on drag.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, does
that hold for the females?

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said no.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Their vagina extends for sex.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%
So I thought that was--

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's just
slightly different.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But also, the
emotional connection

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:84%
sounds like it has to be
at a much higher level

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:90%
of recognition.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:90%
You don't go to a bar.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
There are no bars for
pickups and stuff like that.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.584 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: No, and they
can read their own auras.

00:12:49.584 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK?

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they have an
immediate attraction

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.815 align:middle line:84%
through these auras
to the other person.

00:12:56.815 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And that makes sense.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually happening
in our species, too.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.117 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know it.

00:13:01.117 --> 00:13:02.449 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Slowly but surely, yes.

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about-- he's
here visiting with you.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.600 align:middle line:84%
First of all, why did he choose
to visit with you at this time?

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:84%
What is your
connection with him?

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And what is your
connection with Sirius B?

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into the
complexity and nuances

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
of human beings, who have
lives in other places

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and can go back and forth
over long periods of time.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we all
come from other planets.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
We all came to Earth to take
part in the Earth experiment.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And as Antura explained to
me, not everyone on his planet

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:90%
has lives on Earth.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.540 align:middle line:90%
It's all by choice.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And so some people
are very happy to be

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:90%
in their little lives.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're at this nice
little wonderful level.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:90%
But they're at a level.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And Antura and I,
as it turns out,

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:84%
are members of the same
soul group or cluster.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Theo calls it the cluster.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And typically, your
soul has clusters

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
that are having lives on Earth
that have six to 12 members.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we're members of
the same soul cluster.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually from
that water planet.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:26.227 align:middle line:84%
So his purpose-- first of all,
we have had lives together.

00:14:26.227 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Although he said the last life--

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On Sirius B or here?

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Both.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
He said actually,
the last life we

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
had was at the time
of Atlantis, when

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.730 align:middle line:90%
I was creating the gentle way.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And he was sort of
one of my tour guides

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to help people go
from Atlantis to Egypt

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to resettle before
Atlantis went down.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sirius
B has always been

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.090 align:middle line:84%
featured in the
ancient lore of Egypt.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And according to Antura,
Egypt is actually

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:84%
more like 50,000 years
old, the cultures of Egypt.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, much of it is
buried under sand

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:90%
and buried under more sand.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And actually,
Theo says that it

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.227 align:middle line:84%
will be proved that Egypt was
inhabited 500,000 years ago.

00:15:16.227 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I would not be
surprised at that.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a lot
going on that was concurrent,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.640 align:middle line:84%
like it didn't just go
Lemuria, Atlantis, Egypt.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it existed and was
populated at the same time

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.859 align:middle line:90%
with people moving about.

00:15:28.859 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Because there was flight and
technology in those times.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't
hard to get around.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:33.475 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Right.

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans powered all
their aircraft and everything

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:90%
by the crystals.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that was fine, but
it also had its limits.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So as an example, they could
not go into outer space.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.805 align:middle line:84%
There were limits on the
strength of the rays.

00:15:51.805 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And they would
actually have-- it

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:84%
sounded like they had pyramids,
sort of like booster stations,

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:90%
even in Europe.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: To help--

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
make total sense.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
To help them fly to
their outpost in Europe.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
a lot of in-depth work

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:84%
in Robert Temple's book,
"The Sirius Mystery."

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of our ancient
indigenous cultures

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:84%
have long held memories
of their contact

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.160 align:middle line:84%
with not only those
beings from Sirius B,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:84%
but also have been on that
planet before, as well.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about why
they felt it was time now.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, we can go into the
notion of multiple timelines.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.520 align:middle line:90%
But why now?

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.512 align:middle line:90%
Why the contact now?

00:16:35.512 --> 00:16:36.095 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need to go
into multiple timelines yet.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we don't need to.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But we may or may not
get around to that.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:84%
But why are they contacting
and reaching out now?

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I also
want you to speak

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.215 align:middle line:84%
about what they refer to
us as a veiled species.

00:16:50.215 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody intuitively
understands that, but let's

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and talk about it.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.212 align:middle line:84%
And you may have
to bring me back.

00:16:57.212 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, just go for it.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.670 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:84%
The timeline I've been
given was initially

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:84%
that the Russians would
release all their secret files,

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:90%
including videos and everything.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was supposed
to have happened

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.930 align:middle line:90%
before the start of this year.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:84%
As I've been asking
questions-- and I continued.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:84%
After I closed off the
book in January of 2013,

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I've continued to ask
questions because he tells me

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have a book two.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.994 align:middle line:84%
And so as I've asked
him, well, what's

00:17:34.994 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:90%
happening with the Russians?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Russians have
been dragging their feet.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And they've had to negotiate
with them to the point-- well,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about only
releasing part of them.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But we feel like they'll release
the rest after they put it out.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing kind
of like trial balloons

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
where Medvedev--
if I'm pronouncing

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:84%
his name correctly--
has been quoted twice

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
when supposedly microphones
were off-- oh, yes.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:08.564 align:middle line:84%
We've had contact
with UFOs and ETs.

00:18:08.564 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But then he kind
of laughs it off,

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
just in case people
would get worried.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:84%
But they found that
nobody's worried.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we want to know more.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
supposed to happen.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Now I've been told
that it will not

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:84%
happen until after
the Olympic Games.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're trying
to do all this publicity.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that certainly
would have upstaged the games,

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.152 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't it?

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes, it would.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So they have been given, quote,
"a strong indication" that this

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:84%
will happen after
the Olympic Games.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Then, in 2015-- because they are
supposed to be the first ones

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:84%
to release all
these secret files--

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians
will land in Russia

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and they will make
first public contact.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians will probably
have it at their new space

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:90%
center that they're building.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And there will be sort of like
a pool of journalists and TV

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and radio and what have you
that will cover the event.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And after that, the
Pleiadians-- and the Pleiadians,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
when they come, they're going
to be very sort of diminutive,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.590 align:middle line:84%
more like five feet tall, very
unassuming, very unthreatening.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they tend to look
very humanoid, like one of us.

00:19:31.975 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Right.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But they actually--
well, some of them do.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Pleiades has
all different types.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: But the
ones that are coming

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:90%
look exactly like humans.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going
to come and they're

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:84%
going to look a very sweet
people, non-threatening at all.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And they will start telling
us our history of the Earth.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to
have videos because they

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.500 align:middle line:84%
can go to any timeline
they want and take

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:84%
a video of some major
event, whether it

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:84%
be Atlantis sinking or whatever
and show things like that.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going
to work their way

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth
giving little gifts.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And these will be like
almost artifacts to them,

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:26.190 align:middle line:84%
old things that are
old but are really neat

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.170 align:middle line:84%
kind of gifts for
each government

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.480 align:middle line:90%
that they visit with.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And nothing that
would-- they're not

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.300 align:middle line:84%
supposed to give us
any kind of technology.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:84%
They're supposed to let us
do these things on our own.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%
And so that happens in 2015.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That would be great.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we hear a lot of
people making predictions

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.973 align:middle line:84%
about when things
are going to happen,

00:20:50.973 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and timelines are
always shifting around.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Right.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Now, on
2016-- now, this

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:84%
is going to be interesting
because the Pleiadians will

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
come back another
two or three times.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.594 align:middle line:84%
But in 2016, the Zetas
are supposed to arrive.

00:21:08.594 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yes,
with an apology?

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes, with apology.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.775 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:11.775 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, now you need to--
let's explain to people who

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
the beings from Zeta Reticuli
are, what they've been up to.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones
most commonly depicted

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
when you go to UFO shows
and you have little people

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.942 align:middle line:90%
with big heads.

00:21:24.942 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Big eyes and--

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.983 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about who they really are.

00:21:27.983 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need
to get into it,

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
but there has been US-government
involvement, apparently.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
We know the names of some
people who have supposedly

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:84%
been on missions with the
beings from Zeta Reticuli

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and have reported back
on what life there

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.118 align:middle line:84%
is like-- kind of the reverse
of what you're talking about.

00:21:45.118 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about why
they would apologize to us.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
According to what
I've been told,

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:84%
they were a society
that was dying out.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
The way they
procreated was cloning.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But the clones were not
being ensouled anymore.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to come
to Earth and create a hybrid.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So they came to Earth and
they started abducting people.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Now our souls gave
them permission.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I think our souls
didn't realize what

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:84%
it would do to the people
that were abducted.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I've been told that it was a
total of almost 26,000 people,

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:90%
somewhere around there.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people would
be only abducted one time

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:84%
because they were looking
for a specific DNA signature.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't find
it, that was the last time.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:84%
But others were
abducted 30 and 50

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and even, Antura told
me, as many as 100 times.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And so these people
really-- and they

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.244 align:middle line:84%
have all these
memories suppressed.

00:23:04.244 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a lot
of conflict and trauma

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:90%
in their beings.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: A lot of
conflict and trauma.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And since my book came out,
I've had a lot of people that

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:84%
read my weekly newsletter--
women, mostly--

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:84%
that have come out and said,
Tom, I think I was abducted.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I've checked, nine out
of 10 of them were abducted.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now there's the
work of Dr. John Mack, Harvard

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:90%
clinical psychology.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:84%
He took this subject on,
went into-- at the bequest

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.177 align:middle line:84%
of someone essentially in the
UFO community who understood,

00:23:44.177 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:84%
through hypnosis, what
people were coming up with.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, would you take
this on as, essentially,

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:90%
a case study?

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And it turned into
much more than that.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I think he ended up speaking
with-- I can't remember

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.700 align:middle line:84%
if it was maybe even thousands
of people who came forward

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.710 align:middle line:90%
with their UFO stories.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And going through from a
very scientific point of view

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the common
denominators they all had, even

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
though otherwise they
had nothing in common,

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:90%
in most cases.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think he gave
a lot of credence

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:90%
to the subject of abduction.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
someone-- I did a show

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:84%
with Kim Carlsberg that's in
our archives under Phenomena

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and also one under CMN having to
do with her personal experience

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that she claims to have had--
abductions that took place

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:84%
over a very long period of
time for the specific purpose

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
of cloning and how she felt
about it, which is interesting

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:90%
because it's a mixed bag.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.070 align:middle line:84%
There's terror and
there's often an upgrade

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that happens to the
person that's being used.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And Antura
told me that when

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:84%
they started the
abductions and they started

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
having women actually have
babies, that they would keep

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:84%
them onboard the
spaceship for nine months.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And they had to keep them.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And then they would put
them back in their bed

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes after they've
taken them or whatever.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.445 align:middle line:84%
And they'd go to a
doctor, and the doctor

00:25:04.445 --> 00:25:06.320 align:middle line:84%
would say, oh, you've
recently been pregnant.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Uh, no I haven't.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But he said that
after a while, they

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.250 align:middle line:84%
were able to reduce it
down to four months.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have
to keep them as long.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.240 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
take the fetus and--

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they--
I mean, you said

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that this was done--
though the individuals,

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.380 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind, was
startled and traumatized

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:84%
by this experience-- that
there was a soul agreement.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Did Antura tell you that
there was a soul agreement

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.280 align:middle line:84%
between the individuals and the
other species to help them out?

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.984 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Well, their
souls agreed to it.

00:25:36.984 --> 00:25:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:38.202 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK?

00:25:38.202 --> 00:25:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Not the soul fragments.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no, I
get the difference.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.358 align:middle line:84%
Because I have always felt
there was some kind of agreement

00:25:43.358 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:84%
It appears hostile because
it's not necessarily

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:90%
a warm and fuzzy process.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And they don't think of
things in that way, either.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.662 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be, from all
the reports, very clinical

00:25:55.662 --> 00:25:57.120 align:middle line:84%
in the way they
treat people, which

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:84%
is quite frightening for human
beings to be treated like that.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And what happened,
the federation

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:84%
of planets-- and
there's 200 planets

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:84%
in our quadrant
of the galaxy that

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.270 align:middle line:90%
are members of this federation.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They had had this
Earth directive

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.670 align:middle line:84%
that dated all the way back
to Atlantean days when they

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
saw that Atlantis was
going down the tubes

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and that all this help that they
thought they were giving them

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%
was simply being used
to make one guy more

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
powerful than another
or something like that.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they came up with
this Earth directive

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:90%
that said-- hands off humans.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got to let them
do this on their own.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem was
when the Zetas came,

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have that
in the Earth experiment.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:90%
They never thought about that.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And it took them a year
and a half or two years,

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:84%
universal time, to
bring this together.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was like 20 or
25 years Earth time.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And so they finally said,
you can't do that anymore.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.870 align:middle line:90%
And they stopped them.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And also, it was the Zetas
from an earlier time period.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't the
present-day Zetas.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:90%
That was something else.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this
is a timeline issue

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about here.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Because Antura said they
could have gone into, like,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:90%
the 1800s.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And people would have
been very confused.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
that great at hitting

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:84%
into the right mark on
timelines and they just

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:90%
arrived in the 20th century.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it happened.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we never
did get to the subject

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.810 align:middle line:84%
of the veiling of the human
species, how they term

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:84%
our essential long-term
memory loss that

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.200 align:middle line:84%
has occurred of this species--
which we are waking up

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to our remembrances
again which is,

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.432 align:middle line:84%
to me, that's the great hope
and beauty of our species.

00:28:01.432 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about what they say.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: But we'll never be
taken away from being veiled,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.610 align:middle line:90%
from my understanding.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
Earth experiment.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Theo and Antura and
everyone says that humans--

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.520 align:middle line:90%
we're called the explorer race.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.520 align:middle line:84%
We all volunteered
for this in order

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:84%
to fast-track our souls in
raising vibrational levels.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.180 align:middle line:84%
That's all the souls'
goals is raising

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:90%
your vibrational levels.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:84%
But everyone's been on a
plateau for millions of years.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
They just hit a plateau and
they couldn't go any higher.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And so the creator
said that he wanted

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.770 align:middle line:84%
to have this, where we would
be veiled, not knowing anything

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:84%
about it, so that we would be
able to reinvent the wheel.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we'd be
doing all these things that

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
have been created before by
all these other societies who

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:84%
think they can't
do it any better.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But the creator feels that
they are going to do it better,

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to do
it, and create things

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.900 align:middle line:84%
in different ways that have
never been created before.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we can't go back,
oh, well, let's see.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:84%
That was 10 lives ago when
I handled that problem.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Can't do that.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have to solve
the problem anew,

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we'll solve
it in a better way

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:90%
than has ever been done before.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we were given
this negativity.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And no other society,
no other universe,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:84%
has never been able
to handle negativity.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
billions of universes

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:47.130 align:middle line:84%
because there's
billions of creators.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But no one's been able
to handle negativity.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the creator
felt that we would

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.850 align:middle line:84%
be able to handle
the negativity.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:90%
And we've handled it.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.095 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happened in 1987,

00:29:59.095 --> 00:30:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was, with
the harmonic convergence,

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:84%
where we reached the
level where we will never

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:90%
destroy ourselves.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I think
the Urantia work says

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:84%
there was a big
shift in the 1980s,

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.600 align:middle line:84%
as well, where we passed
some kind of threshold that

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.700 align:middle line:90%
was really critical.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when we passed
that threshold,

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:90%
we will never destroy ourselves.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.870 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to have any
more world wars and things like

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that that people
keep worrying about.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there will be conflicts.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And yes, even places
like Afghanistan.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I've asked Theo
before, well, when

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:84%
is Afghanistan finally
going to settle down?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:90%
50 years.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:40.770 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
was told one time--

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at
doing a documentary

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.480 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of
the Middle East.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, because
I speak with my own guides,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:90%
guardian angels, all the time.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was told
very specifically,

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
do not put yourself
in harm's way.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:84%
This will not be resolved
in your lifetime.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So use your energies
toward the things

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:84%
that you can make a
better difference with.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So that does validate what
you're saying, as well.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.780 align:middle line:90%
I was disappointed.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.830 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to take it on.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: So all of
this is designed.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
be our contribution

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:84%
to the whole universe and
other universes, in actuality.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got not only--
Antura and Theo

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.869 align:middle line:84%
say parking is at a
premium around the planet.

00:31:29.869 --> 00:31:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.660 align:middle line:84%
We're the object
of great interest.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Yes, not only from our
universe, from other societies,

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:90%
but other universes.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.574 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.574 --> 00:31:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to talk
about this negativity

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit more.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone knows
what that word means.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows what
it feels like to suffer

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:84%
through resistance
and doubt and fear

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and the infliction
of pain and bullying

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and dominance of all
kinds over-- and fighting

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.550 align:middle line:90%
for one's own sovereignty.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We all know, to one degree or
another, what that feels like.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have been
through, depending

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.240 align:middle line:84%
on your belief
system-- many people,

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.740 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of lifetimes,
maybe more, in some cases.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly learning
how to operate

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.490 align:middle line:84%
with grace and
creativity and love

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:24.340 align:middle line:84%
amidst this sea of
negative influences.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that there are--
each of the world's traditions

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.140 align:middle line:84%
views it differently for
our species in terms of it's

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.600 align:middle line:84%
always finding that
balance between the two,

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:90%
between the light and the dark.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
that you've been

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
told that the other planets,
the other realms that exist

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.905 align:middle line:84%
are not experiencing
that kind of negativity?

00:32:46.905 --> 00:32:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not at all.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.400 align:middle line:84%
They've thrown it
away, out the window.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.490 align:middle line:90%
They can't handle it.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
supposed to give.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.940 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
our contribution.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Negativity.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Negativity to
the rest of the universe.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.880 align:middle line:84%
But we're only going to give
them anywhere, I've been told,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.470 align:middle line:90%
from 2/10 of a percent to 2%.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.860 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be the maximum
negativity we're going to give.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
things like games.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Games require a
winner and a loser.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.850 align:middle line:90%
And they don't have games.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
brings in feelings

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.125 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't have
experienced before.

00:33:15.125 --> 00:33:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Right.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
games because of that.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to introduce little
things like games to them.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:21.491 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:21.491 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about that.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I tend to think
of some of the-- they

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.070 align:middle line:90%
call it Star Wars.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of the wars between
the species of the past

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:84%
certainly seems to hold a
great amount of negativity,

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:90%
dominance, and so forth.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're talking
some rogue elements.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And let's go and talk about
it because Antura talked

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.285 align:middle line:84%
about what the reptilians
were doing, who they are,

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:90%
and then how things shook down.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Give us his view of
what the reptilians have

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.424 align:middle line:90%
been up to and why.

00:33:47.424 --> 00:33:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:53.060 align:middle line:84%
There really was
a real Star Wars.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It happened approximately
two million years--

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.150 align:middle line:84%
one million or two million
years ago Earth time,

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:84%
but only like 100,000 or
200,000 years universal time.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a fairly long
time, but still not that long.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And the reptilians,
just out of the blue,

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.620 align:middle line:84%
decided that they
wanted to take over

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.030 align:middle line:84%
some extra planets
for their resources.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they attacked them, and
they actually conquered them.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And so this
federation of planets,

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.710 align:middle line:84%
they weren't a
federation at that time.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:32.250 align:middle line:84%
They didn't become a federation
until after the end of the Star

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:90%
Wars.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But all these
planets got together

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:90%
to fight the reptilians.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And this Star Wars
went on for thousands

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:44.080 align:middle line:90%
of universal years, thousands.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.020 align:middle line:90%
And it got very nasty.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.067 align:middle line:84%
And Antura explained--
and I'd never

00:34:48.067 --> 00:34:49.150 align:middle line:90%
thought about this before.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:53.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know in your
movies, your "Star Wars" movies

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.440 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, it's shown that
maybe a planet is destroyed.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:90%
He said, they wouldn't do that.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.980 align:middle line:84%
They would destroy the
sun, and all the planets

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.822 align:middle line:90%
would be destroyed.

00:35:02.822 --> 00:35:03.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did that happen?

00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Did that occur?

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes, that happened.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In certain
planetary systems?

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Yes, certain
solar systems.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.370 align:middle line:84%
They just completely
destroyed everything.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:11.164 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:35:11.164 --> 00:35:11.705 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:35:11.705 --> 00:35:12.757 align:middle line:90%
That's the end game.

00:35:12.757 --> 00:35:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And so this went on
for thousands of years.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they were
able to negotiate

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.550 align:middle line:84%
a peace that included the
reptilians withdrawing

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%
from the planets that
they had conquered,

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:84%
which was really a pretty
difficult negotiation.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they agreed to

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:36.210 align:middle line:84%
was that the reptilians
could take part

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:90%
in the Earth experiment.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are
approximately 5,000 souls,

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:84%
with all of their soul
clusters of six to 12 each.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they are taking part
in the Earth experiment.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're all having
lives on Earth, too.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is
it fair to say-- I

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.876 align:middle line:84%
mean, because we have
so much information

00:36:03.876 --> 00:36:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that scoots around the
internet and otherwise

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.440 align:middle line:84%
about the reptilian
species, is it fair

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.630 align:middle line:84%
to say that we're looking at,
like any species, those who

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:84%
are still here as part
of this experiment

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.970 align:middle line:90%
have varying agendas?

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously
their souls are just

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.730 align:middle line:90%
like any other Earth soul.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all come
from other planets.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:29.210 align:middle line:84%
We're all going to go back to
our home planets and say, gosh,

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:33.930 align:middle line:84%
this is what we learned
to help our species.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going to wind up
one day returning to their home

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.910 align:middle line:90%
planets.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But I was reminded,
Antura says, keep in mind,

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:84%
creator loves variety and
creator loves all beings.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, this is true.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And when we go into
judgment about these--

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.810 align:middle line:84%
especially because
reptilians have gotten

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.824 align:middle line:84%
a little more publicity than
some of the other species.

00:36:58.824 --> 00:37:00.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
to remember it's

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.700 align:middle line:84%
no different than
an Earth species.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.260 align:middle line:84%
You have rogue agendas
who have no real interest

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.140 align:middle line:84%
for any interest but their
own, not for the greater whole.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And you have the same
thing among human beings.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like some of
the other species you're

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.610 align:middle line:84%
talking about have
gotten past that

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and can work more on behalf
of the betterment of all.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the reptilians
and human beings

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
are not that far apart
in terms of the fact

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.030 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing
very similar--

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.390 align:middle line:84%
trying to learn by bumping
off the edges of darkness.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.015 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Right.

00:37:28.015 --> 00:37:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And with that in mind, Antura is
part of the first contact team.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:90%
They go to planets.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:36.460 align:middle line:84%
They introduce
themselves but normally

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.510 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years
before the planet

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:43.190 align:middle line:84%
actually gets to our
stage, as an example.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he's part of
this first contact team.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:53.319 align:middle line:84%
And when they come in this
big huge mother ship in 2017,

00:37:53.319 --> 00:37:55.110 align:middle line:84%
there's actually going
to be two reptilians

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.230 align:middle line:90%
on the ship with them.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
bird beings, there's

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.861 align:middle line:84%
going to be plant beings
there's going to be--

00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
like a flying arc?

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Oh, yeah.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:08.670 align:middle line:84%
He said-- and I'm supposed
to go to the mother ship.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's a mile wide.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Tom, your
senses will be on overload

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.750 align:middle line:84%
the whole time you're there
from all the different beings

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.450 align:middle line:90%
that you'll see.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we
have to be open to things

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.160 align:middle line:90%
that do not appear like us.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And someone I interviewed
just very recently

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.170 align:middle line:84%
received a lot of
technological knowledge

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.857 align:middle line:84%
throughout his lifetime from
a being that was reptilian.

00:38:32.857 --> 00:38:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I want to meet you.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no,
you don't really.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, yes I do.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So after a period
of years and years,

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:84%
they finally arranged
for a physical meeting.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.370 align:middle line:90%
And he said he was terrified.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And it took him a few
years for his nerves

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:84%
to calm down to be able
to really assimilate

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:90%
that physical meeting.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.020 align:middle line:90%
And they never met again.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
something that, I mean,

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.050 align:middle line:84%
perhaps Hollywood-- I do
not care for the agenda.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.710 align:middle line:90%
It's so dark and dystopian.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But that said,
perhaps Hollywood is

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.690 align:middle line:84%
beginning to prepare
humanity for what

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.985 align:middle line:84%
are going to be very
strange and unusual species.

00:39:08.985 --> 00:39:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Or maybe I
will, because Antura,

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.710 align:middle line:84%
just before I closed the book
off, he finally tells me,

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Tom, by the way.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.870 align:middle line:84%
We want you to
film a documentary

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.054 align:middle line:90%
onboard the mother ship.

00:39:21.054 --> 00:39:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, do it.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:23.011 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: With you family.

00:39:23.011 --> 00:39:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do it.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: My daughter
is a film graduate

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and owns her own
photography business.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:90%
So it looks like--

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I'd love this.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:84%
If you guys are
beamed up, good luck.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.940 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to see the film.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
Pleiadians because they

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.420 align:middle line:84%
seem to be thought of in a more
benevolent light by humanity.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's because the
ones that have shown themselves

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.060 align:middle line:84%
throughout history
look more like us--

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.000 align:middle line:84%
or, we can say we
look like them.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.680 align:middle line:90%
This is one big experiment.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
their previous agenda.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:02.440 align:middle line:84%
What has gone on between the
Pleiades and the Earth people?

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.916 align:middle line:90%
And then what the agenda is now.

00:40:03.916 --> 00:40:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And we already
said they're going

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:84%
to be first contact because
they look more like us, right?

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:90%
What is their agenda?

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Gosh.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just to
slowly introduce us

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the
universe, in reality.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And even, as an example, just
before Antura and his crowd

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.630 align:middle line:84%
comes, the Pleiadians
are going to come back.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to say,
now, the next group of people

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.154 align:middle line:84%
that come are going to
look really different.

00:40:38.154 --> 00:40:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And we just kind of
want to prepare you.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
going to be Sirius B?

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:41.979 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:40:41.979 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Well, that's
the ship from Sirius B.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:84%
The blue beings with the
leathery skin and the little

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.170 align:middle line:90%
webbed fingers and toes.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Yeah, but,
I mean, there's

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.036 align:middle line:84%
only like two or
three of him that

00:40:52.036 --> 00:40:53.674 align:middle line:90%
are going to be on the ship.

00:40:53.674 --> 00:40:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.250 align:middle line:84%
The group you were talking about
before-- a bit of everything.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:56.833 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:40:56.833 --> 00:41:00.110 align:middle line:84%
There's going to
be a crew of 850.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:02.641 align:middle line:84%
At one point, when we
first started talking,

00:41:02.641 --> 00:41:05.140 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of up in the air
as to how many would be coming.

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, the ship
holds 750 to 1,000.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And so as we got
into it, he finally

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.072 align:middle line:84%
told me not too long ago
that as things get closer,

00:41:16.072 --> 00:41:17.780 align:middle line:84%
everybody's kind of
getting more excited.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it's up to 850
that'll be on the ship.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hey, truth is
stranger than fiction.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed so
many people, and what

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:28.092 align:middle line:84%
I've heard about and some things
that I've seen personally--

00:41:28.092 --> 00:41:30.550 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason something
like this shouldn't take place.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.800 align:middle line:90%
It would make sense, you know?

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at it as
inviting the human species

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:39.370 align:middle line:84%
into a larger context of cosmic
being, then it would make sense

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.386 align:middle line:84%
we should have larger
exposure like that.

00:41:41.386 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Right.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, as an example, he told
me there were plant beings.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.864 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:41:46.864 --> 00:41:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Plant beings, yes.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.405 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: In the
last few months--

00:41:49.405 --> 00:41:50.930 align:middle line:90%
this is not in the book.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But I started trying to ask
questions, specific questions,

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:90%
of what plant beings look like.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And I had the hardest time.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I said, well do
they have an endoskeleton?

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:04.016 align:middle line:90%
Do they have an exoskeleton?

00:42:04.016 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
they have stocks there

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.740 align:middle line:90%
that are light sensors.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:16.215 align:middle line:84%
And they have anywhere from
six to eight appendages.

00:42:16.215 --> 00:42:19.085 align:middle line:90%


00:42:19.085 --> 00:42:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All you
have to do, actually,

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.776 align:middle line:84%
is look at certain
forms of seahorses,

00:42:22.776 --> 00:42:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and you can see what a
plant being might look like.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is one
that disguises itself

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.440 align:middle line:84%
among the plant life
on the sea floor that's

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.964 align:middle line:84%
just an amazing
little plant being.

00:42:34.964 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a plant being.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:37.120 align:middle line:90%
But it's a seahorse.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: There you go.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.818 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:42:38.818 --> 00:42:39.520 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.936 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And so
I'm sure I'm going

00:42:40.936 --> 00:42:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to see larger
varieties of those.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so let's
talk a little bit about what

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.880 align:middle line:90%
they say about our future.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is becoming of us
because as you say, or they

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:59.160 align:middle line:84%
say, we have learned
to overcome and work

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:84%
within a field of
negativity relatively well,

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.730 align:middle line:84%
considering what
we're up against.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to give
ourselves a little credit there.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And then also technologically,
because again you said earlier

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and others have said technology
is only to be introduced here

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.540 align:middle line:84%
at the rate we can perceive it
or at a gentle rate if there's

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.810 align:middle line:84%
some ET intervention and not the
whole enchilada at once because

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:84%
of a level of maturity
issue in how to use it.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Because of course
there are entities

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.420 align:middle line:90%
that go right for dominance.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Certain countries and militaries
go right for dominance

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.660 align:middle line:84%
with the technology if
it's powerful enough.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So what are they saying
about the introduction

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.173 align:middle line:84%
and development of
our own technology?

00:43:36.173 --> 00:43:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:42.700 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take a lot longer
to do things than we think.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.160 align:middle line:84%
As an example, we will not
start traveling to the stars

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.060 align:middle line:90%
until 3250.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.156 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn, eventually,
how to portal hop.

00:43:52.156 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
how they get here.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't take a space flight.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't go at a
million miles an hour.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.110 align:middle line:90%
They portal hop.

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like
"Battlestar Galactica."

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can't go from
one place in the universe

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the
edge of the other one.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.600 align:middle line:90%
You have to take little stops.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.450 align:middle line:84%
You described it as Southwest
Airlines going from Florida

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.850 align:middle line:90%
to Los Angeles.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:17.575 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of acted surprised.

00:44:17.575 --> 00:44:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Tom, we know
everything about you.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:middle line:90%
We have studied everything.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got to
learn things like that.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And part of that
force field device

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:38.040 align:middle line:84%
also translates every single
language in the universe.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And it blocks out the
other person's language

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.040 align:middle line:84%
so that the being doesn't
hear that language.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.540 align:middle line:84%
They only hear it
in their language.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.831 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hear it interpreted
into their language, yes.

00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And when
they talk, it sounds

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.090 align:middle line:84%
to the other person,
the other being,

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.060 align:middle line:90%
just like in their language.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So I would love to see us
start working on even a device

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.512 align:middle line:84%
to translate all the
languages of Earth.

00:45:02.512 --> 00:45:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.260 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And have headsets
and a little microphone

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:08.550 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And we could go
anywhere on Earth

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and be able to
interact with anybody.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.260 align:middle line:90%
And I hope that happens one day.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And so when we get
to the stars, we

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.165 align:middle line:84%
are going to be introducing this
little amount of negativity.

00:45:27.165 --> 00:45:29.460 align:middle line:90%
And everyone is scared.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all these
other societies

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.760 align:middle line:84%
are kind of excited
but at the same time--

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and I said, well, why don't
you just go ahead and accept

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.470 align:middle line:90%
a little tiny negativity now?

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.040 align:middle line:90%
We're waiting as long as we can.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.552 align:middle line:90%
They're a little--

00:45:45.552 --> 00:45:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one wants
to deal with the subject

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:48.655 align:middle line:90%
of those contrasts.

00:45:48.655 --> 00:45:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Right.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.779 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right now
it sounds like--

00:45:50.779 --> 00:45:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And 3250 is just fine
with them before we start going

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:84%
to the stars and
they're forced--

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really understanding
the use of portals properly.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.836 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Right,
and they're forced

00:46:01.836 --> 00:46:05.130 align:middle line:90%
to start handling negativity.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:08.010 align:middle line:84%
They're just fine
the way they are.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And part of what you
learned in all of this-- again,

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.310 align:middle line:84%
we referred to it a moment
ago or at the beginning

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:17.540 align:middle line:84%
of the interview-- has
to do with timelines.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:21.080 align:middle line:84%
You may have incarnated
actually bringing information

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.800 align:middle line:84%
from what we consider to
be a future incarnation,

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.430 align:middle line:84%
incarnating backwards to bring
certain information through,

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:28.260 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And many of us are
doing that, many.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.820 align:middle line:90%
We're on multiple timelines.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Can you just go into
that a little bit?

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: OK.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.890 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind,
past and present lives

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:42.690 align:middle line:90%
are different than timelines.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.784 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we sort of--

00:46:43.784 --> 00:46:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.451 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, make the distinction
between the two

00:46:46.451 --> 00:46:48.866 align:middle line:84%
because I kind of threw them
all in the same bucket there.

00:46:48.866 --> 00:46:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah, OK.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:52.620 align:middle line:90%
So there are 12 timelines.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.370 align:middle line:90%
We're on timeline number six.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.070 align:middle line:90%
We're a middle frequency.

00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And so there are timelines that
have harder lives that we have

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and timelines that have much
easier lives than we have.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.190 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other discussion.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Then there are these different
lives that we all have.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And typically,
I've been told, we

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:18.940 align:middle line:84%
have an average of 600
to 800 lives on Earth.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have to experience
every single thing

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:26.520 align:middle line:84%
that Earth has to offer, the
bad stuff and the good stuff,

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.690 align:middle line:90%
before we finished our lives.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it's sort of like
our little bucket list.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Cross--

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Learn
everything you can.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.543 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:47:33.543 --> 00:47:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Cross off fires off of
this one or floods off

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.850 align:middle line:90%
of this one or whatever.

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And so those lives, you
do go back and forth.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So as an example, I know
my wife, in her next life,

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:54.490 align:middle line:84%
is going to go back
in ancient Egypt

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and be a leader of his
people at that time.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
be his assistant.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.710 align:middle line:90%
But that's a past life to me.

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I've already had that
life 100 or 200 lives ago.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a past one, but
that will be her next life.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.050 align:middle line:90%
So we jump back and forth.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:17.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't go in linear
from one to the next.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:18.552 align:middle line:90%
It's here and then back.

00:48:18.552 --> 00:48:20.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is no
linear time and space.

00:48:20.385 --> 00:48:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: My next
life will be in 3400,

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be a space pilot on
one of 17 Earth starships.

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:29.430 align:middle line:90%
So there'll be 17 at that time.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:31.230 align:middle line:90%
At least I know by 3400--

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: We'll have those.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.666 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you can
see-- I mean, as human beings,

00:48:35.666 --> 00:48:37.720 align:middle line:84%
we're living artificially
shortened lives

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:41.190 align:middle line:84%
in a physical,
material, animal body

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:46.090 align:middle line:84%
that is very susceptible to
all sorts of violent acts

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:49.050 align:middle line:84%
that could end our lives
rapidly and painfully.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You can see how living in
this kind of environment

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:56.110 align:middle line:84%
would certainly toughen
up the skin of the soul.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:58.526 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
I can see where--

00:48:58.526 --> 00:48:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: But all
these things are

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:05.080 align:middle line:84%
raising our vibrational
levels at what

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Theo says is an
exponential rate.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can see that.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: I mean,
we're just going boom,

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.657 align:middle line:84%
right through compared to
other souls in the universe.

00:49:15.657 --> 00:49:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: They're all kind
of hovering on this level.

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:20.496 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're taking on
the challenges by default.

00:49:20.496 --> 00:49:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, if we
didn't have a veiled memory,

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:24.040 align:middle line:90%
don't know about that.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.087 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, sometimes
ignorance is bliss.

00:49:27.087 --> 00:49:28.420 align:middle line:90%
If you knew what was coming up--

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Yeah, that's why
we have shorter lives.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.430 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're
so difficult.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.280 align:middle line:84%
We're taking on so
many challenges.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I've been told that we make
more decisions in one day

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:40.682 align:middle line:84%
than some societies
make in a year or more.

00:49:40.682 --> 00:49:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I was listening in on a
reading from the being

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that I'm affiliated with
most closely for lifetime

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.390 align:middle line:90%
after lifetime of somebody else.

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking to this
person who is a newbie here,

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.630 align:middle line:84%
who hadn't been
around Earth much.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Oh, gosh.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she was
having a very hard time.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.860 align:middle line:90%
It was very confounding.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just liquid pools of
blue, crying all the time,

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.540 align:middle line:90%
like, I don't understand.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And so she asked for
this reading from them.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, you
chose to come here to learn,

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.940 align:middle line:90%
to learn some more things.

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Because where you come from,
they said, as an example,

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.750 align:middle line:84%
it would be as though the
people you've been amongst only

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:22.860 align:middle line:90%
know very few things.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.009 align:middle line:90%
Just a few things.

00:50:24.009 --> 00:50:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And you've mastered
those few things.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And now the being is much more
curious to expand beyond that.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And you chose to jump into this
particular environment, which

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:37.200 align:middle line:84%
is you have millions of things
you can make decisions on

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and millions of
experiences to be had.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought she
was a perfect example

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of how it can also
go really wrong.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.720 align:middle line:84%
She was having a really,
really hard time.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: I know.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder, you'd think a
newbie be-- like I was told,

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.090 align:middle line:84%
one of my first lives on
Earth was in a jungle,

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:58.070 align:middle line:90%
as a native or whatever.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And you'd think they'd
be put into kind

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:01.430 align:middle line:90%
of situations like that.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they're dropped
in a very advanced society.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.545 align:middle line:90%
And they're just lost.

00:51:07.545 --> 00:51:10.750 align:middle line:84%
It's called sink or
swim, and they sink.

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.620 align:middle line:90%
But they learn a lot.

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I just
have one more question.

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:15.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a juicy one.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I just want to know
before we sign off

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.190 align:middle line:84%
here, of all of the things
that you've been learning

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:23.180 align:middle line:84%
through the years
from Antura, what

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.680 align:middle line:90%
is it that excites you most?

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.097 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Oh, what
excites me most?

00:51:28.097 --> 00:51:29.263 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One or two things.

00:51:29.263 --> 00:51:29.912 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:51:29.912 --> 00:51:31.120 align:middle line:90%
We've got a few minutes here.

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: I think some of
the things that I've learned

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:39.460 align:middle line:84%
are about devices
and things that I

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.920 align:middle line:90%
could see are ahead of us.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And other things
are like knowing

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:47.930 align:middle line:84%
that there's other universes
that are even adjacent to ours.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:53.470 align:middle line:84%
That there's even a
universe right next to ours

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:55.570 align:middle line:84%
that we can see
in our night sky.

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:58.275 align:middle line:84%
And we think it's our universe,
but it's the next universe

00:51:58.275 --> 00:51:59.270 align:middle line:90%
over.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And Antura has been
to that universe.

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:05.096 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Tom, you don't
have anything to compare it to.

00:52:05.096 --> 00:52:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I
can guarantee you,

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.460 align:middle line:84%
it is so different
from our universe.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.920 align:middle line:90%
You would not believe it.

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And so there are so many things
for us to learn in the future.

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And I just think it's a very
exciting time as we slowly

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.010 align:middle line:90%
work our way up the path.

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And your book is-- aside
from being just instructive

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and looking at a different view
of the ET species out there,

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.500 align:middle line:90%
it's a blast.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.250 align:middle line:90%
I just loved it.

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And I love the fact that you
ask questions in such detail

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:41.370 align:middle line:84%
that it elicited such
a very clear portrait

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:42.875 align:middle line:90%
of another species.

00:52:42.875 --> 00:52:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Great.

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:44.841 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Thank you.

00:52:44.841 --> 00:52:45.950 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tom's book,
"First Contact,"

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.600 align:middle line:84%
is a thrilling ride into other
worlds and our own future.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.260 align:middle line:84%
You can find it in amazon.com
and through his website,

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.970 align:middle line:90%
thegentlewaybook.com.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:57.880 align:middle line:84%
It does appear it's time to
begin looking beyond ourselves

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and embrace a larger
picture of what

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.810 align:middle line:84%
it is to be a human being
in a massive universe.

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:04.650 align:middle line:90%
In fact, within universes.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
