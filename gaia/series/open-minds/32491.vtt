>> Regina Meredith: When you
look around at the insanity

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.292 align:middle line:84%
of western society lives,
doesn't it begin more

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.928 align:middle line:84%
like a cult than a
sustainable lifestyle.

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Authority patent would agree.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.732 align:middle line:84%
So, what does it take
to remove ourselves

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:34.635 align:middle line:84%
from that consensus
trance as it's been called

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.303 align:middle line:84%
and begin living
in authentic life

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.973 align:middle line:84%
that is satisfying
and sustainable.

Terry is with us to
share his strategies

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:42.877 align:middle line:90%
on Spiritual Activism.

00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:44.111 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show Terry.

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:44.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Terry Patten: Thanks.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:45.813 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:46.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: I
went through you blogs

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:49.016 align:middle line:84%
and that one was
particularly intriguing.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:54.088 align:middle line:84%
Are you in a cult and one
of things that I was pointed

00:00:54.088 --> 00:01:00.161 align:middle line:84%
to was a quote by the Dalai Lama
on what it is to be in a cult.

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:02.363 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was go
ahead and we'll put this up

00:01:02.363 --> 00:01:04.431 align:middle line:90%
and read this because,

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.334 align:middle line:84%
sounds like we're all pretty
much living in a cult.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:11.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Terry Patten: Well, we're
living a crazy way of life

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.741 align:middle line:84%
that everyone accepts
and it is unquestioned.

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:18.846 align:middle line:84%
And if you questioned it, your
in threat of being regarded

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:22.516 align:middle line:84%
as outside the main stream and
maybe people would even begin

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:24.251 align:middle line:84%
or your family member
begin to ask, are you--

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:25.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Are you in a cult?

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Terry Patten:
Getting into a cult,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.289 align:middle line:84%
if you get out of the
cult of this world.

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Well,
let's read the quote

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:33.593 align:middle line:84%
and then see just how-- how
widely it applies to people

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.563 align:middle line:90%
in western societies at large.

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:37.264 align:middle line:90%
So, this is a Dalai Lama.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:40.568 align:middle line:84%
You know you're in a cult if
you, "sacrifice your health

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:42.036 align:middle line:90%
in order to make money.

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:45.239 align:middle line:84%
Then you sacrifice money
to recuperate your health.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.441 align:middle line:84%
Then you're so anxious
about the future,

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:48.842 align:middle line:90%
you don't enjoy the present.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.578 align:middle line:84%
The result being
that you do not leave

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:52.212 align:middle line:90%
in the present or the future.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.381 align:middle line:84%
You leave as if you
are never going to die

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:56.617 align:middle line:84%
and then you die
having never lived."

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.686 align:middle line:90%
That sounds like us doesn't it?

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:00.054 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Exactly.

00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so, when
you're talking about cult,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:84%
you were motivated to write that
particular blog for a reason.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.896 align:middle line:84%
So, what is you definition
of a cult

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:11.565 align:middle line:84%
and what was your inspiration
to go this direction.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:16.336 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Well, in this time, we've
got some big bugaboos and taboos

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:17.805 align:middle line:84%
and one of them is
being in a cult.

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:20.007 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the worse things
that you know, you can be.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.142 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the forms
of witchcraft

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.912 align:middle line:84%
for which we burn you
know, in PR terms,

00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:29.717 align:middle line:84%
we burn those that
defy the norm.

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:32.753 align:middle line:84%
But very often, the people
who are experimenting

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:35.788 align:middle line:84%
with having a teacher or trying
to get together with a group

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.726 align:middle line:84%
of people to leave a different
way are trying to break up.

00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to wake up
from the-- what Charley Tart,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.134 align:middle line:84%
the neuroscientist called
the consensus trance

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:48.235 align:middle line:90%
which really has to do

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.371 align:middle line:84%
with living automatic
unconscious patterns

00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:51.505 align:middle line:90%
that are conditioned.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: In fact, we have
a quote from him too.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I actually wrote it down just
in case you brought Charley up.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.248 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed him the 1980s
around a similar subject as this

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:05.986 align:middle line:84%
when he said, again, "a state
of partly suspended animation,

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:09.123 align:middle line:84%
of stupor, of inability to
function at you maximum level,

00:03:09.123 --> 00:03:11.959 align:middle line:84%
dominated by automatic
and conditioned patterns

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.794 align:middle line:84%
of perception, thinking,
feeling and behaving."

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:15.195 align:middle line:84%
Is that pretty much
some of that?

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.196 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Exactly.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.598 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And yeah, go ahead.

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:21.201 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: So, the task of being
a human being in this time

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
which is really a
very exciting time.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.705 align:middle line:84%
We're the luckiest
people who've ever lived.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:28.275 align:middle line:84%
We have more wealth, more
mobility, more information,

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:32.913 align:middle line:84%
more opportunity, more comfort,
more ease than anybody has had

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:34.315 align:middle line:90%
in the history of mankind.

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.384 align:middle line:84%
We're living better than the
kings and queens of a hundred

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.721 align:middle line:84%
or 200 years ago, we're able
to live in most respect.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:46.026 align:middle line:84%
So, that wondrous bounty
that is on all sides

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.495 align:middle line:90%
of this is paradoxical--

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
paradoxically just opposed
to the fact that there's--

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.637 align:middle line:84%
there is such a weight of the
pattern that has as living

00:03:56.637 --> 00:04:00.507 align:middle line:84%
as if sleep walking through life
most of the time, and the task

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:05.713 align:middle line:84%
of waking up to really inherit
the full richness of our bounty.

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:07.881 align:middle line:90%
It's really everyone's agenda.

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:13.687 align:middle line:84%
Like to be a human being in
this time to been born in a time

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:17.391 align:middle line:84%
where we're awaken the early
21st century and intending

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:20.293 align:middle line:84%
to grow to awaken,
to take advantage

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
of the incredible
opportunities that the internet

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.867 align:middle line:84%
and that the proliferation of
information, the coming together

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.536 align:middle line:84%
of all the great spiritual
traditions of mankind

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:31.638 align:middle line:84%
in conversation with
one another.

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.408 align:middle line:84%
To take advantage about that,
it's a matter of waking up.

00:04:34.408 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But then waking up from any idea
you have about what waking up is

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.814 align:middle line:90%
into something beyond that.

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:44.351 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of reawakening
again and again and again,

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.353 align:middle line:90%
showing up in each moment.

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:49.823 align:middle line:84%
In a real way, and that
process of really waking

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:53.861 align:middle line:84%
up is it takes you outside
the consensus trance.

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.363 align:middle line:90%
And that means breaking a taboo.

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:59.566 align:middle line:84%
Your friends may say, well,
something funny about you

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.403 align:middle line:84%
or wait a second, you begin
to get a little lonelier

00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:90%
as you get more awake.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.573 align:middle line:84%
Because you're, you're
living that hurt.

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:09.576 align:middle line:84%
You're beginning to get
out in front of something

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:11.779 align:middle line:84%
and that getting out in
front to something that I,

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.149 align:middle line:84%
I hope that this
conservation empowers people

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:19.219 align:middle line:84%
to have more courage to be
more alone and that sense,

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:25.059 align:middle line:84%
alone in awakening that takes
them out of the mass of people

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:26.994 align:middle line:84%
who are tending to live
a condition and kind

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.797 align:middle line:84%
of sleep walking
pattern of life.

00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It-- absolutely and when
you do play your self back,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.604 align:middle line:84%
you feel very different
to the people around you.

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:39.139 align:middle line:84%
If you're choosing
to participate

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.577 align:middle line:84%
in the moment 100 percent that
means you are engaging almost

00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:46.313 align:middle line:84%
in the disciplined
committed way in that moment

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:84%
in reevaluating each thing
that you're perceiving,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.251 align:middle line:90%
thinking, your reactions.

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.287 align:middle line:84%
When people are really
were accustomed

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:56.256 align:middle line:90%
to each other in our auto moods.

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:58.859 align:middle line:84%
You can pretty much almost
predict what your friends

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:01.662 align:middle line:84%
and family are going to
say at, at any given point

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:03.497 align:middle line:90%
in most conversations, right?

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:06.767 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Yeah, in fact there's
a recent interest neurological

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:08.135 align:middle line:90%
experiment that was done.

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:11.438 align:middle line:84%
There's-- There's a certain
kind of amnesia, certain kind

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:14.608 align:middle line:84%
of aphasia that can take
place neurologically.

00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:19.346 align:middle line:84%
And people will suddenly
realize, "Oh, I'm here.

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:20.347 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?"

00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:21.582 align:middle line:84%
And they'll start
asking questions.

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
They'll go through the same
routine again and again

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.185 align:middle line:84%
and again each time
that happens.

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:31.058 align:middle line:84%
That is the way we awaken
into the moment to the degree

00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:33.894 align:middle line:84%
that we're conditioned
causes us to behave

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and almost exactly the
same scripted ways.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.067 align:middle line:84%
That is big trunks of us
are automa-- are automatic.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:42.169 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Being operated out
of the subconscious mind.

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: And, and that's OK.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.705 align:middle line:90%
We need to forgive ourselves.

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:47.107 align:middle line:84%
A big part of us
are automatic, OK.

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:51.979 align:middle line:84%
But there's a part of you that
isn't and it's that center,

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.983 align:middle line:84%
that conscious center that I'm
interested to speak to because

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:58.585 align:middle line:84%
that part of me really
wants to show up.

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:02.189 align:middle line:84%
It does not want to be
constantly kind of enslaved

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:03.891 align:middle line:90%
by the automaticities.

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:05.158 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well, there's a must--

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:06.593 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: And our world needs
that on a brighter scale.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.995 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:10.163 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: It needs a lot of us to
wake up because what we're doing

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.366 align:middle line:84%
in our sleep walking
and specially if walking

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:14.801 align:middle line:84%
into some pretty
serious territory

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:18.071 align:middle line:84%
and we maybe sleep walking
into real catastrophe.

00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:21.375 align:middle line:84%
So, what is it for
us reckon with all

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:90%
of that really responsibly?

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.113 align:middle line:84%
Well, that-- that's the
excitement being alive

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.381 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:32.019 align:middle line:84%
We are alive in the most
exciting time in human history.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:35.322 align:middle line:84%
To sleepwalk through
that is crazy.

00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:38.725 align:middle line:84%
If everything you loved,
if everyone you loved were

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:45.933 align:middle line:84%
to be threatened by an intense
evolutionary squeeze point,

00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:47.267 align:middle line:90%
you would want to be there.

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:48.769 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're the ones
who've got to be there.

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:50.904 align:middle line:90%
We're here for the family.

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:52.072 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does it take for us

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.473 align:middle line:84%
to really be here
for the family?

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.843 align:middle line:84%
It's not mindless activism
in a more than it's a kind

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.979 align:middle line:84%
of automatic narrow
spirituality.

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:01.515 align:middle line:84%
It's inner work that's
linked to the outer work.

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:05.352 align:middle line:84%
But that inner work requires
us to awaken again and again

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:08.422 align:middle line:84%
and again and again in
every, every moment.

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:11.325 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But at the same time it
seems that people decide, "Yes,

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:14.161 align:middle line:84%
I-- I want to participate
in some thing."

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:18.031 align:middle line:84%
So, again you start moving
into whatever the message

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:22.202 align:middle line:84%
of that particular endeavor
or point of activism is.

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:25.806 align:middle line:84%
And then you start falling
into the monstrous of that.

00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: That's right.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.575 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And it doesn't
seem to-- it doesn't--

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:31.777 align:middle line:84%
in spite of our best
efforts, this is something

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
that goes far beyond choosing a
cause even if it's the sustain--

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:84%
sustenance of our
global ecology.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.559 align:middle line:84%
It's moving beyond the desire to
participate in specific cause.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:47.861 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work if we're
not showing up in the way

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:48.996 align:middle line:90%
that you're speaking about--

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.264 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: That's right.

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- which is reevaluating
each thought, you know,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.901 align:middle line:90%
each interaction, right?

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:58.071 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Well, there's a choice
in every single moment.

00:08:58.071 --> 00:09:02.876 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know the, the great
psychologist Viktor Frankl

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:06.213 align:middle line:84%
who survived the Nazi
death camps looked back

00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:07.781 align:middle line:90%
on his experience there.

00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:10.651 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that
we have choice even

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:12.753 align:middle line:90%
when we're at our most helpless.

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:16.156 align:middle line:84%
If you're chained to a wall,
if you're being tortured,

00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:17.691 align:middle line:90%
you still have a choice whether

00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:21.328 align:middle line:84%
to forgive your tormentors
or to hate them.

00:09:21.328 --> 00:09:25.399 align:middle line:84%
And the difference between those
two creates a whole different

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:29.803 align:middle line:84%
world even in the most
helpless moment you have choice.

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:32.139 align:middle line:84%
Well, in every moment
you have choice.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:34.241 align:middle line:90%
Where do you put your attention?

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:36.376 align:middle line:90%
How do you put your attention?

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:37.344 align:middle line:90%
What is you attitude?

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:39.179 align:middle line:90%
What is your feeling energy?

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.648 align:middle line:84%
In every moment, you're
tending to become unconscious

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:44.317 align:middle line:84%
so in every moment there's
an opportunity to show up.

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:45.252 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Wake back up.

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:47.087 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: And become
more conscious.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:51.158 align:middle line:84%
This is a life of a
practice, a consciousness

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:52.893 align:middle line:84%
in a sense we could
call it yoga.

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:57.464 align:middle line:84%
All of life is yoga, a more
profound yoga of awakening

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:00.267 align:middle line:84%
from bondage to the
stream of thoughts

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:02.336 align:middle line:90%
and reflexive identification

00:10:02.336 --> 00:10:05.172 align:middle line:84%
with the skin and
capsulated ego.

00:10:05.172 --> 00:10:07.374 align:middle line:84%
But also awakening
into the moment,

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.543 align:middle line:84%
into this emergent
moment right now

00:10:09.543 --> 00:10:10.811 align:middle line:84%
and in this moment
and in this moment.

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:13.447 align:middle line:90%
This is where the new come in.

00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:15.482 align:middle line:84%
Not through something
I already know.

00:10:15.482 --> 00:10:19.352 align:middle line:84%
Not through some great wisdom
no matter how great it is.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:24.491 align:middle line:84%
The repetition of that is
something you know becomes a rat

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:25.058 align:middle line:90%
that that--

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:25.859 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:26.993 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: -- that you flow in.

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.095 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about
that hypnagogic state

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:31.031 align:middle line:84%
and how we have fallen
into it and--

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and what we're most
vulnerable to?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Technically, a
hypnagogic state is a, you know,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.339 align:middle line:84%
particular fate of
brainwave pattern

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:42.676 align:middle line:84%
that we're not always
in that technically.

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:48.115 align:middle line:84%
But we are always tending
toward the familiar and that

00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:53.353 align:middle line:84%
in the patterning's of,
of our familiar routines,

00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:84%
our familiar thought patterns,
our familiar emotional patterns

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.594 align:middle line:84%
and in which where set in motion
by the dynamics of our family

00:11:00.594 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:84%
of origin in the way it was
with our mom and our dad

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.998 align:middle line:90%
and our brothers and sisters

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.501 align:middle line:84%
and the circumstance
of all of that tend--

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:09.169 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: We find our dynamic.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.303 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:10.303 --> 00:11:11.905 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: They tend to just
be repeating themselves

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.641 align:middle line:84%
and no body is completely
free of that.

00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:90%
We all have a certain imprint.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.313 align:middle line:84%
We are all patterned beings,
something wrong with that.

00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:24.384 align:middle line:84%
But the way we relate to it,
our relationship to experience,

00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:27.087 align:middle line:84%
this is something we have
total choice in relation

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:32.826 align:middle line:84%
to who I really am
is not tarry the--

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:37.964 align:middle line:84%
this body mind in here
experiencing a world out there.

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:40.801 align:middle line:84%
Who I really, really
am at the deepest level

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.069 align:middle line:84%
of my being is free
consciousness.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:46.406 align:middle line:84%
Experiencing this body
and mind, and world

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:47.641 align:middle line:90%
and that's who you are.

00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:51.411 align:middle line:84%
That's who each of us really
is, free consciousness.

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:56.316 align:middle line:84%
Free consciousness is infinitely
created, infinitely courageous,

00:11:56.316 --> 00:12:00.587 align:middle line:84%
infinitely happy, and
free, and willing.

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:05.725 align:middle line:84%
And that is the place from which
we can re-pattern our world.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:10.263 align:middle line:84%
We're in a moment in which it's
time to turn a profound corner

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:14.267 align:middle line:84%
and for there to be very rapid
cultural evolution in our world.

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:17.103 align:middle line:84%
This transformation of
human culture is something

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:19.406 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't just
happen by it self.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:22.442 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
enacted by real people

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:26.413 align:middle line:84%
like that famous quote from the
anthropologist Margaret Mead,

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:29.216 align:middle line:90%
"Never doubt that a small group

00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:33.653 align:middle line:84%
of committed citizens
can't change the world."

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:35.422 align:middle line:90%
In fact nothing else ever has.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.556 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You're right.

00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:40.894 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: It-- It is us the
doing of this is, is--

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:43.096 align:middle line:84%
like if you think about
it as a system sprinter,

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:84%
we're all now waking
up into the reality

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.968 align:middle line:90%
that everything is systemic

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:50.871 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
patterns and meta patterns.

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:53.273 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'd look at the meta
patterns of life on earth

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:56.343 align:middle line:84%
and in this-- this
era, we can kind of see

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:59.379 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain
kinds of responsibilities

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:02.782 align:middle line:84%
that the president of the United
States or the Secretary General

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:06.219 align:middle line:84%
of the United Nations or the
leaders of the major countries

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:10.657 align:middle line:84%
in the free world or the Bill
Gates' sort of the, you know,

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:13.426 align:middle line:84%
the Brad and Angelina's
or you know the,

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:15.195 align:middle line:90%
the rich powerful have.

00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:17.464 align:middle line:84%
But they, they have
very limited power also.

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.599 align:middle line:84%
They can't just change
the world.

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:22.535 align:middle line:84%
The pattern is going
to have the change in,

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:23.904 align:middle line:90%
in the whole body of it.

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:25.705 align:middle line:84%
There's going to have
to be an awakening.

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:29.142 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just some big
shot somewhere making some

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.877 align:middle line:90%
new decision.

00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:33.213 align:middle line:84%
The responsibility
and the opportunity

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:84%
for real choice lives in
the whole body of humanity.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.421 align:middle line:84%
So, conscious individuals in a
relatively privileged society

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:45.158 align:middle line:84%
like probably everyone
hearing these words right now.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.194 align:middle line:84%
We are-- We are a
locust of responsibility.

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:50.864 align:middle line:84%
In fact that there is no
responsibility in that chair,

00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:55.001 align:middle line:84%
in this chair and the chair
of each person who's listening

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:58.004 align:middle line:90%
to these words, it is not.

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.639 align:middle line:90%
So, what would it be?

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:02.676 align:middle line:84%
What is it right here
and right now for us

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:09.816 align:middle line:84%
to be awaken alive humorous,
self forgiving, other forgiving,

00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:16.022 align:middle line:84%
empowered, free, creative enough
to be that change really be,

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.625 align:middle line:84%
really imagine of change
beyond what we all ready know.

00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:22.395 align:middle line:84%
Not just turn that
into a cliche.

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:25.432 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And-- which in-- be
the change is bumper sticker.

00:14:25.432 --> 00:14:28.335 align:middle line:84%
It has become almost a cliche
without true engagement in it

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:31.504 align:middle line:84%
and that and one of the things
we look at when it comes

00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:35.842 align:middle line:84%
to changing, when it comes
to breaking the con--

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:39.713 align:middle line:84%
the, the habit of the way we
think and being in the kind

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:42.215 align:middle line:84%
of quote like status
we are in our lives is

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.217 align:middle line:84%
that we're afraid
to go through pain.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:48.355 align:middle line:84%
There's a vulnerability
involve because if we were--

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:51.391 align:middle line:84%
if for example, I interviewed
Andrew Harvey not long ago

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:55.996 align:middle line:84%
on his Sacred Activism and he
was saying that what we need

00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:58.865 align:middle line:84%
to engage with is the thing
that if you were to wake

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:01.868 align:middle line:84%
up at 3 o'clock in the morning
in that vulnerable place

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:03.703 align:middle line:84%
where the veils are
thin, what is the thing

00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:05.472 align:middle line:90%
that most breaks your heart?

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:08.942 align:middle line:84%
Most people would rather think
about the laundry list of what's

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:11.578 align:middle line:84%
to do later in the
day then really go

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:14.714 align:middle line:84%
into what breaks our
heart because that level

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:17.584 align:middle line:84%
of engagement makes us
extremely vulnerable.

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.687 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: We're dealing with
a lot and a lot of levels.

00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:24.724 align:middle line:84%
There are so much
information coming at us.

00:15:24.724 --> 00:15:28.461 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, human knowledge
is doubling every eight

00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:90%
or nine years.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.332 align:middle line:84%
The amount of data
that's coming at us

00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:35.301 align:middle line:84%
from all directions is
almost overwhelming.

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:39.906 align:middle line:84%
Finding enough confidence and
clarity to feel like we know

00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:43.009 align:middle line:84%
and can see what's really
happening around us.

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:48.114 align:middle line:84%
And then on the basis of that to
show up in our personal lives,

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.648 align:middle line:90%
is it that the big paradox here.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.618 align:middle line:84%
We have this incredible
global vision.

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.687 align:middle line:84%
We can see things on
this huge enormous scale.

00:15:54.687 --> 00:16:01.194 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine universe that's
13.7 billion light years

00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:02.062 align:middle line:90%
in size.

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:02.896 align:middle line:90%
You know that that is--

00:16:02.896 --> 00:16:05.198 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And that's just one them.

00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:06.299 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Right.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Right, the scope our imagination
is so great and yet the scope

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.738 align:middle line:84%
of our own empowerment
where I'm just

00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:13.673 align:middle line:90%
on seven billion on the planet.

00:16:13.673 --> 00:16:16.643 align:middle line:84%
You know, that paradox
is enormous

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.711 align:middle line:84%
because we're such
feeling beings.

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:22.849 align:middle line:84%
See we're at a root such
passionate caring beings.

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:27.387 align:middle line:84%
And, and so, the-- the
thing that you said

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:31.891 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning is encountered
with discomfort, this core.

00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:35.829 align:middle line:84%
When I feel my discomfort
so strongly that I

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.631 align:middle line:84%
that I can't get away
from it when I can't be

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:42.268 align:middle line:84%
in a sense comfortable with
a certain level of pain

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:44.504 align:middle line:90%
and discomfort and confusion.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:48.675 align:middle line:84%
When I, when I become clear
and strong enough that I can be

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:53.012 align:middle line:84%
in this crazy world with my
incomplete understanding,

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:56.316 align:middle line:84%
with my discomfort
and, and still trust,

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:58.685 align:middle line:90%
trust life, trust my self.

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:06.693 align:middle line:84%
That enables me to liberate
the, the range of my capacities

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:11.097 align:middle line:84%
because what we-- our really
reaches capacity has come

00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:12.197 align:middle line:90%
from having our fits [phonetic].

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
We're really on the
ground really rooted.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:22.075 align:middle line:84%
And knowing the essential loving
nature of our, of our root being

00:17:22.075 --> 00:17:25.578 align:middle line:84%
and letting the passion of
our being course through us

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:27.881 align:middle line:90%
and recruit our intelligence.

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:33.119 align:middle line:84%
That fire can jails us
into something so dynamic

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and so world changing that
it's that that is what you feel

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.827 align:middle line:84%
in Andrew when he's really lit
up in speaking passionately

00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:43.429 align:middle line:84%
about the Christ
and the goddess.

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:51.271 align:middle line:84%
These-- This way of being lift
up by our passion arrives really

00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
through free consciousness
being able

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.442 align:middle line:90%
to encounter all the limitations

00:17:56.442 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:84%
of the personal personality
limited story

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.883 align:middle line:84%
and not be destructive from
it's essential character.

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:05.919 align:middle line:84%
And it's the liberation
of that and the liberation

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of us together into a
place of contact with being

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.794 align:middle line:84%
with one another with the fact
that our world needs us here

00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:19.499 align:middle line:84%
and now to be in
enactment of in awakening.

00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:21.834 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And yet, you look
at the younger generation

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.169 align:middle line:84%
and it's interesting
they're see--

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:26.172 align:middle line:84%
they seem to be somewhat
in the extremes right now.

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:29.976 align:middle line:84%
You have this incredible
interconnectedness on one level.

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:32.212 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just looking at
how we move this forward

00:18:32.212 --> 00:18:34.314 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll go back to
the cult in the moment.

00:18:34.314 --> 00:18:35.648 align:middle line:90%
Well, that is kind of a cult.

00:18:35.648 --> 00:18:38.451 align:middle line:84%
This technological cult that
the younger people are in--

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.419 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Sure.

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:41.387 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: There is this
transparency.

00:18:41.387 --> 00:18:44.924 align:middle line:84%
This incredible
interconnectedness

00:18:44.924 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, this
intense face to face kind

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.567 align:middle line:84%
of vulnerability in
revelation is reduced to a text,

00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:56.803 align:middle line:90%
reduced to even digits.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:19:01.241 align:middle line:84%
And so, what is it that
it's going to take to bridge

00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:05.278 align:middle line:84%
that generation into coming
into these richness and fullness

00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:07.046 align:middle line:84%
of this full expression
face to face

00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:09.716 align:middle line:84%
and even vulnerable
with each other?

00:19:09.716 --> 00:19:12.886 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: We have to have
the courage to drop

00:19:12.886 --> 00:19:16.389 align:middle line:84%
down from our energy
being caught up here.

00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
We have to make that faithful 16
inch journey from head to heart

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and even to God and
in our conversations

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.866 align:middle line:84%
with our own teenagers and our
conversations with each other.

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to drop down and admit,
you know, it's hard to be me.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.238 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to be a person.

00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:34.974 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to have
all this information

00:19:34.974 --> 00:19:39.445 align:middle line:84%
and all this opportunity and not
always know how to acquit it.

00:19:39.445 --> 00:19:43.182 align:middle line:90%
I really do feel inspire to,

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.118 align:middle line:84%
to make a huge difference
on this planet.

00:19:45.118 --> 00:19:48.187 align:middle line:84%
I'm not quite sure how
to do it and I care

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.989 align:middle line:84%
and that question is
big and I have to live

00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:52.458 align:middle line:84%
in that question and
let it change me.

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard for me and we
can say to our, you know, to--

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.767 align:middle line:84%
in the conversation
with the teenager.

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:04.804 align:middle line:84%
We can let our pain in
our humanity and also love

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and our vulnerability show.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.144 align:middle line:84%
This is how we break
the cult, the taboo.

00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:13.079 align:middle line:84%
There, there a number
of big taboos.

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:15.748 align:middle line:84%
One of them is against
showing you pain.

00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:19.452 align:middle line:84%
One of them is against
showing your ecstasy.

00:20:19.452 --> 00:20:22.422 align:middle line:84%
One of them is against
showing love in a way

00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that really makes
you vulnerable.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.559 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
break us out of the cult.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:31.164 align:middle line:84%
It breaks us out of the
superficial kind of "I'm OK.

00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:32.165 align:middle line:90%
You know, how are you?

00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:34.567 align:middle line:84%
Fine." What do we
mean we say fine?

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:37.203 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's appropriate
to really tell you right now.

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:38.571 align:middle line:84%
It's more or less
what we've mean.

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:39.973 align:middle line:84%
We mean, well, you
know I've got that up--

00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:41.374 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Unless I don't
want to engage.

00:20:41.374 --> 00:20:43.843 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: I've got enough resources
that I can put a positive span

00:20:43.843 --> 00:20:45.645 align:middle line:84%
on it and that should
be good enough.

00:20:45.645 --> 00:20:49.515 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps us very distant
and really in personal.

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:51.451 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Have you done
this in your own life?

00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:52.285 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Absolutely.

00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:53.486 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: As an experiment to go

00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:55.154 align:middle line:84%
through the day every
time says, "How are you?"

00:20:55.154 --> 00:20:58.057 align:middle line:84%
And actually tell to be exactly
how you are in the moment

00:20:58.057 --> 00:21:00.059 align:middle line:84%
because that is one way
of breaking the trance.

00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:01.461 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: No.

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.696 align:middle line:84%
It's a very difficult, it's
a very difficult discipline

00:21:03.696 --> 00:21:06.065 align:middle line:84%
because if you really
think about it Regina,

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:09.335 align:middle line:84%
each of those conversations
takes at least 20-30 minutes.

00:21:09.335 --> 00:21:12.372 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I know, even if you gave
the thumbnails sketch you still

00:21:12.372 --> 00:21:14.607 align:middle line:84%
have to reveal something
of your self

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:17.143 align:middle line:84%
but I mean I'm sure that'd
be shocking most people

00:21:17.143 --> 00:21:18.845 align:middle line:84%
like more information
than I need.

00:21:18.845 --> 00:21:21.748 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really mean-- I'm
sorry I asked and all of that.

00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:22.682 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Exactly, exactly.

00:21:22.682 --> 00:21:24.217 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We don't really
day-to-day

00:21:24.217 --> 00:21:25.752 align:middle line:90%
to this social intercourse want

00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:28.221 align:middle line:84%
to know how each other
are, is in that sense.

00:21:28.221 --> 00:21:31.858 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Well, we-- we often don't

00:21:31.858 --> 00:21:34.193 align:middle line:84%
but when we actually
have an encounter

00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:38.264 align:middle line:84%
where we really feel the depth
and authenticity and presence

00:21:38.264 --> 00:21:43.236 align:middle line:84%
of this feeling human heart,
breathing, caring, beating,

00:21:43.236 --> 00:21:46.172 align:middle line:84%
you know, the fact that
we live in this time

00:21:46.172 --> 00:21:49.876 align:middle line:84%
in which global warming is
at such a critical point

00:21:49.876 --> 00:21:51.844 align:middle line:84%
and weather changes
are so intense

00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:54.814 align:middle line:84%
and scientist are telling
us that it so critical

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:58.084 align:middle line:84%
that we actually wake up
and show up right now.

00:21:58.084 --> 00:22:02.155 align:middle line:84%
That to be alive in the midst
of that knowing about thousands

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:04.891 align:middle line:84%
of species going extinct,
you know, already.

00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:07.527 align:middle line:84%
We're in the midst of the
sixth great extinction.

00:22:07.527 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:84%
That hurts and our ability to
feel the pain of the world,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.203 align:middle line:84%
our ability to let that
in and then even to share

00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:19.172 align:middle line:84%
that with others,
these are parts

00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:90%
of how we break down the cult.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.910 align:middle line:84%
We become awake not to--
to the pain of that.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:29.015 align:middle line:84%
We also become awake maybe
if we're lucky to do miracle

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:34.687 align:middle line:84%
of even one moment of embodied
conscious existence the fact

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:37.089 align:middle line:84%
that awareness is
free right here,

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.926 align:middle line:90%
right now as me and as you.

00:22:39.926 --> 00:22:43.629 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, and as you
talked that incredible force

00:22:43.629 --> 00:22:45.965 align:middle line:84%
that we call this
conscious awareness

00:22:45.965 --> 00:22:49.235 align:middle line:84%
or love even bringing it in that
course in the sentimental term

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:52.438 align:middle line:84%
but in the broadest
term the compassion

00:22:52.438 --> 00:22:56.209 align:middle line:84%
that all embracing universal
term is what Will Tiller,

00:22:56.209 --> 00:23:00.146 align:middle line:84%
the physicist William Tiller
calls the universal solvent.

00:23:00.146 --> 00:23:02.748 align:middle line:90%
It's what-- is the medium

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:05.451 align:middle line:84%
in which everything
you're talking about,

00:23:05.451 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:90%
every effort grows.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.688 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: That's right.

00:23:08.688 --> 00:23:12.725 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes awareness is
called the universal solvent.

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:15.862 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes love is called
the universal solvent.

00:23:15.862 --> 00:23:18.164 align:middle line:84%
And in the great
spiritual traditions,

00:23:18.164 --> 00:23:21.033 align:middle line:84%
the other fulfillment
or free awareness

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and the other fulfillment of
love are indistinguishable

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.673 align:middle line:84%
if you're fully, fully
loving, you are so awake.

00:23:27.673 --> 00:23:31.811 align:middle line:84%
If you're really fully awake,
you are nothing about love.

00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:36.849 align:middle line:84%
If you are fully given over to
your love of the great beloved,

00:23:36.849 --> 00:23:39.485 align:middle line:84%
the universal beloved who's
always before you no matter

00:23:39.485 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:84%
where you look, the
beloved is before us.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:48.094 align:middle line:84%
If you're awakening all
those ways, you fall open

00:23:48.094 --> 00:23:50.796 align:middle line:84%
into a passionate commitment
to the here and now,

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:52.565 align:middle line:84%
because right now
something is necessary.

00:23:52.565 --> 00:23:55.201 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But it requires your
complete authenticity really.

00:23:55.201 --> 00:23:57.803 align:middle line:84%
To be fully engage, you
have to be authentic.

00:23:57.803 --> 00:23:58.504 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: And-- And to be--

00:23:58.504 --> 00:23:59.772 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And on hide.

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:03.576 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: And to be that authentic,
is to really let it rip.

00:24:03.576 --> 00:24:04.677 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:24:04.677 --> 00:24:05.811 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: It is-- There's--
there's a great word

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:08.514 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient Greek,
"parousia" and it means

00:24:08.514 --> 00:24:12.218 align:middle line:84%
to tell the truth without
limitation, to take risks

00:24:12.218 --> 00:24:15.054 align:middle line:84%
by telling the truth
ruggedly, freely.

00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:16.822 align:middle line:90%
Socrates did that.

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:21.861 align:middle line:84%
The kind of truth telling
that's necessary today is rugged

00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:22.995 align:middle line:90%
in that essence.

00:24:22.995 --> 00:24:24.864 align:middle line:84%
It's a willingness to
breakthrough the veil,

00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:26.432 align:middle line:90%
to breakthrough the trance,

00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:31.804 align:middle line:84%
to let the luminous white
hot intensity of love

00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:34.273 align:middle line:84%
which is living you and
living in me right now

00:24:34.273 --> 00:24:36.242 align:middle line:90%
and living everyone right now.

00:24:36.242 --> 00:24:40.713 align:middle line:84%
Breakthrough the veil into
presence to waked us up.

00:24:40.713 --> 00:24:43.883 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It might as well because
lies aren't being supported.

00:24:43.883 --> 00:24:48.087 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the prevailing
energy surrounds us.

00:24:48.087 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
The new paradigm that's
sweeping in really doesn't allow

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.025 align:middle line:84%
for that lack of transparency
and those lies might

00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:54.226 align:middle line:90%
as well start telling the truth.

00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:56.629 align:middle line:84%
And however, what was
that that movement

00:24:56.629 --> 00:24:59.799 align:middle line:84%
of few years ago radical
honesty I think it was called

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:02.702 align:middle line:84%
and that was controversial
because it seems

00:25:02.702 --> 00:25:07.807 align:middle line:84%
as though there is, was
almost the fine line

00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:11.143 align:middle line:84%
where you were causing more
trauma than was necessary

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:84%
in releasing your truth
which comes from a very hurt

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and often traumatize damage
place in our own beings

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.085 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying
to contend with.

00:25:19.085 --> 00:25:22.855 align:middle line:84%
So, this whole issue about
authenticity and honesty, how--

00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:25.992 align:middle line:84%
how is that modulated when
you're looking at trauma

00:25:25.992 --> 00:25:28.794 align:middle line:84%
and trapped with in
boom radical honesty?

00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:30.162 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
say what's true

00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:32.565 align:middle line:84%
in another person that's the
recipient that's starts feeling

00:25:32.565 --> 00:25:33.966 align:middle line:90%
like a garbage bucket.

00:25:33.966 --> 00:25:38.971 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Well, that-- there are
paradoxes everywhere in turn.

00:25:38.971 --> 00:25:41.507 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of my
teaching in frame.

00:25:41.507 --> 00:25:43.976 align:middle line:84%
We call it integral and by
an integral we're basically

00:25:43.976 --> 00:25:47.013 align:middle line:84%
meaning, we have to
bring together both poles

00:25:47.013 --> 00:25:49.015 align:middle line:90%
of each polarity.

00:25:49.015 --> 00:25:52.118 align:middle line:84%
There has to be both
a willingness

00:25:52.118 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:84%
to be radically honest,
and a great deal

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.421 align:middle line:90%
of sensitivity and kindness--

00:25:55.421 --> 00:25:56.522 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:25:56.522 --> 00:25:57.423 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: -- in the way
we perceive the person

00:25:57.423 --> 00:25:58.591 align:middle line:90%
to whom we're speaking.

00:25:58.591 --> 00:26:00.826 align:middle line:90%
And what it is to be both end.

00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:04.263 align:middle line:84%
It's about going from an
either or mind they can see--

00:26:04.263 --> 00:26:08.467 align:middle line:84%
when we contrast the
trance to waking up,

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:11.237 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of an either/or
distinction but when it comes

00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:14.473 align:middle line:84%
to bringing in the life, you're
always dealing with the paradox

00:26:14.473 --> 00:26:16.942 align:middle line:84%
and you're having to
bring together both sides.

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:18.811 align:middle line:84%
That's what integral
consciousness is really about.

00:26:18.811 --> 00:26:22.581 align:middle line:84%
As we wake up from the
trance into free awareness,

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:25.518 align:middle line:84%
we're also waking up
into a dynamic and which

00:26:25.518 --> 00:26:29.355 align:middle line:84%
where in a world that's evolving
but consciousness has evolved.

00:26:29.355 --> 00:26:30.589 align:middle line:90%
Our personal consciousness

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.992 align:middle line:84%
and also the collective
consciousness of--

00:26:32.992 --> 00:26:37.196 align:middle line:84%
of people, culturally, in our
country and other country.

00:26:37.196 --> 00:26:41.967 align:middle line:84%
This culture wars that are being
waged right now are expressions

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:46.105 align:middle line:84%
of cultures in transition who
are uncomfortable with the speed

00:26:46.105 --> 00:26:49.742 align:middle line:84%
of change and that's why we're
bumping into one another.

00:26:49.742 --> 00:26:53.279 align:middle line:84%
But interiors, interior
experience consciousness

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:55.548 align:middle line:84%
of groups of people
is evolving too.

00:26:55.548 --> 00:26:56.916 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:26:56.916 --> 00:26:58.384 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: And that evolution of
culture right now is asking us

00:26:58.384 --> 00:27:04.223 align:middle line:84%
to get to a place where we
stop settling for easy answers

00:27:04.223 --> 00:27:06.158 align:middle line:84%
or we wake up into the
fact that we have to show

00:27:06.158 --> 00:27:09.762 align:middle line:84%
up in the living moment,
this moment in a complex

00:27:09.762 --> 00:27:13.632 align:middle line:84%
and paradoxical world in which
there are no easy answers

00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:16.001 align:middle line:84%
and which it's there, there
are two truth and they're true

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:18.137 align:middle line:84%
and they're both have to
be taking into account.

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:22.007 align:middle line:84%
In fact there are three or five
or 20 that have to be balanced

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:26.979 align:middle line:84%
and being willing to just keep
breathing open allows surrender

00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:30.549 align:middle line:90%
into that this life is a school

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:34.053 align:middle line:84%
and right now everybody who's
really awake is being given the

00:27:34.053 --> 00:27:37.123 align:middle line:84%
graduate program, the
post-graduate program.

00:27:37.123 --> 00:27:38.224 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right, right.

00:27:38.224 --> 00:27:39.358 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: It's the, it's
the-- you, you're--

00:27:39.358 --> 00:27:41.427 align:middle line:84%
if you're being lived
by that greater force,

00:27:41.427 --> 00:27:42.962 align:middle line:90%
you're in the fast lane.

00:27:42.962 --> 00:27:45.431 align:middle line:84%
And the fast lane is
blowing our hair back.

00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:47.199 align:middle line:90%
It's wild.

00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:48.934 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we
were born for.

00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:53.572 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And then around us is a
sound by culture like you say.

00:27:53.572 --> 00:27:56.442 align:middle line:84%
It is complex, both
answers can have truth

00:27:56.442 --> 00:28:00.946 align:middle line:84%
and we have been conditioned by
media and education and so fort

00:28:00.946 --> 00:28:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to look for again the single
simplistic answer to everything

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.886 align:middle line:84%
which does not exist
in most cases.

00:28:06.886 --> 00:28:08.854 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's a very
good point you make.

00:28:08.854 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking about the
notion of then been picking it

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:84%
up and doing something with it
being comfortable with duality

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
in terms of truth to
understanding truth,

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:22.368 align:middle line:84%
we'd look at the jacks to
position between kind of well,

00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:25.004 align:middle line:84%
more of the Buddhist
way of thought

00:28:25.004 --> 00:28:28.641 align:middle line:84%
which is everything
is perfect as it is.

00:28:28.641 --> 00:28:30.776 align:middle line:84%
There is that that
school of thought.

00:28:30.776 --> 00:28:32.711 align:middle line:90%
Everything is perfect as it is.

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:35.581 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at from a
very, very high point of view,

00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:38.284 align:middle line:84%
it's perfect and this is
our creation in the moment.

00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So, if you take a snapshot,
every moment is perfect

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.254 align:middle line:90%
and that is our creation.

00:28:42.254 --> 00:28:43.556 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: It's absolutely perfect.

00:28:43.556 --> 00:28:44.256 align:middle line:90%
It's radiant.

00:28:44.256 --> 00:28:45.057 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:46.125 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:47.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm so grateful.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.828 align:middle line:90%
So, grateful to be me,

00:28:48.828 --> 00:28:52.231 align:middle line:84%
to be here right now
every moment is a gift.

00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And yet at the
same time, we're talking

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.737 align:middle line:84%
about participating in
authentic spiritual activism

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:01.307 align:middle line:84%
which means plant your
feet down in reality

00:29:01.307 --> 00:29:03.475 align:middle line:90%
and do something about it.

and lighthearted and playful
and courageous and kind of wild

00:29:17.022 --> 00:29:21.927 align:middle line:84%
and spunky and empowered by
the perfection of it all.

00:29:21.927 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
If that, if that
gratitude doesn't kind of--

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.232 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Enjoy the
craziness of the perfection.

00:29:26.232 --> 00:29:28.767 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: And, and then some
sense really able to enjoy it.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:32.104 align:middle line:84%
But also to be penetrated,
to be--

00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:84%
to see and feel the way in which
we all hurt and to be humble

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.047 align:middle line:84%
in the face of complexity that
often outstrips our capacity

00:29:42.047 --> 00:29:43.449 align:middle line:90%
to make sense of it all.

00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:45.951 align:middle line:84%
And yet-- and yet
to see that it--

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:48.921 align:middle line:84%
that it requires our passionate
commitment and we have

00:29:48.921 --> 00:29:52.892 align:middle line:84%
to do our best just because
it so complex doesn't mean

00:29:52.892 --> 00:29:57.263 align:middle line:84%
that we should sit back
and only be observers.

00:29:57.263 --> 00:29:59.498 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot we can see
in the absorber place.

00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:01.533 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
get the big picture.

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:04.203 align:middle line:84%
But it's important for that
big picture to get downloaded

00:30:04.203 --> 00:30:06.071 align:middle line:90%
into our responsibility.

00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:90%
We are the global citizenry.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.311 align:middle line:84%
If we don't understand our
responsibility, you know,

00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:14.446 align:middle line:84%
there's-- there's a
great statement by,

00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:16.949 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Plato.

00:30:16.949 --> 00:30:20.753 align:middle line:84%
"Those who are too smart to get
involve in politics are punished

00:30:20.753 --> 00:30:23.055 align:middle line:84%
by being governed by those who
are stupider than themselves."

00:30:23.055 --> 00:30:24.089 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:25.491 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:30:25.491 --> 00:30:28.127 align:middle line:84%
And we know there-- and there,
there is something to be said

00:30:28.127 --> 00:30:31.096 align:middle line:84%
for the quality of each
human being's participation.

00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:36.635 align:middle line:84%
And that there are those who
are very good at being quiet

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:39.271 align:middle line:84%
and centered in holding
a very clear space.

00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:43.142 align:middle line:84%
That's what their unique
capability on the planet is.

00:30:43.142 --> 00:30:46.045 align:middle line:84%
And there are those who
are fired up and need

00:30:46.045 --> 00:30:48.881 align:middle line:84%
to become involved
in a very active way.

00:30:48.881 --> 00:30:50.749 align:middle line:84%
So, in the sense even
if it's not embodied

00:30:50.749 --> 00:30:53.018 align:middle line:84%
with in each individual,
it's still embodied

00:30:53.018 --> 00:30:54.887 align:middle line:84%
with in the collective
and they don't have to be

00:30:54.887 --> 00:30:56.055 align:middle line:90%
at odds with each other.

00:30:56.055 --> 00:30:58.057 align:middle line:90%
Both are needed at this time.

00:30:58.057 --> 00:31:00.726 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Well, there are a lot of
different kinds of leadership.

00:31:00.726 --> 00:31:05.664 align:middle line:84%
There are-- there are people
whose day job might be janitor

00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:08.734 align:middle line:84%
or personal assistant
to an executive

00:31:08.734 --> 00:31:13.305 align:middle line:84%
who have had conversations with
that executive that they serve

00:31:13.305 --> 00:31:16.842 align:middle line:84%
where the quiet heroism
and dignity and--

00:31:16.842 --> 00:31:19.078 align:middle line:84%
and integrity that
they're bringing

00:31:19.078 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:84%
to a very ordinary life
issues has become visible

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.084 align:middle line:84%
to that big shot
and has helped give

00:31:25.084 --> 00:31:28.153 align:middle line:84%
that individual the
strength to make decisions

00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:30.222 align:middle line:84%
that have a affected
the lives of hundreds

00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:90%
or thousands of others.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.858 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:31:32.858 --> 00:31:34.927 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: So, the heroism comes
from a lot of different places.

00:31:34.927 --> 00:31:36.862 align:middle line:90%
There are no individuals

00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:39.898 align:middle line:84%
who become heroes
completely on their own.

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.367 align:middle line:90%
We're all surrounded.

00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:42.735 align:middle line:90%
We're social creatures.

00:31:42.735 --> 00:31:45.037 align:middle line:84%
We evolved in hundred
gather or advanced.

00:31:45.037 --> 00:31:48.941 align:middle line:84%
Our neurology is and our way
of orienting [phonetic] is all

00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:50.943 align:middle line:84%
about our connection
to other people.

00:31:50.943 --> 00:31:54.346 align:middle line:84%
So, you affect everybody
in your life even two

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:58.283 align:middle line:90%
or three steps we moved.

00:31:58.283 --> 00:32:02.354 align:middle line:84%
And so, the-- as you become
clearer and more and more

00:32:02.354 --> 00:32:05.858 align:middle line:84%
of a practitioner, as
you awaken more fully

00:32:05.858 --> 00:32:09.395 align:middle line:84%
into the divinity
of your humanity.

00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:12.698 align:middle line:84%
You kind of let your heart break
and drop into your humanity

00:32:12.698 --> 00:32:15.901 align:middle line:84%
and to the ways in which
it hurts to be a lot.

00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But you also open up into the
divinity of your humanity,

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.842 align:middle line:90%
the fact that you are also free.

00:32:23.842 --> 00:32:26.478 align:middle line:84%
The things are perfect and
that everything is at stake

00:32:26.478 --> 00:32:29.381 align:middle line:84%
and that your action
right now matters.

00:32:29.381 --> 00:32:33.185 align:middle line:84%
If this is life for death matter
on the globe and it a life

00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:37.256 align:middle line:84%
for death matter even in your
own life how you show up today

00:32:37.256 --> 00:32:39.525 align:middle line:90%
so much depends on it.

00:32:39.525 --> 00:32:41.393 align:middle line:84%
And yet, things are
perfect as they are.

00:32:41.393 --> 00:32:43.829 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't have happened
if there wasn't that kind

00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:47.099 align:middle line:84%
of perfection in them
and being able to be fed

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:49.701 align:middle line:90%
by that to ride that wave.

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:52.938 align:middle line:84%
This is-- this is our
whole lives were we're

00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:54.840 align:middle line:84%
in school learning
how to do this.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.945 align:middle line:84%
This is a coon [phonetic] at
deep question that we live with

00:32:59.945 --> 00:33:02.614 align:middle line:84%
and that transforms
our consciousness.

00:33:02.614 --> 00:33:08.253 align:middle line:84%
So, the fact that we catch
wind of it doesn't exhaust it.

00:33:08.253 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:84%
We will deepen in to it for
years and years and years.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.559 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to catch
our concept,

00:33:13.559 --> 00:33:15.394 align:middle line:84%
that's just the first
level of it.

00:33:15.394 --> 00:33:20.232 align:middle line:84%
Bringing that down into our
breath and body and souls

00:33:20.232 --> 00:33:23.102 align:middle line:84%
down into our feet,
that's the work

00:33:23.102 --> 00:33:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that really makes
it operational.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.173 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And yet we shouldn't
feel guilty if we are--

00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:31.477 align:middle line:84%
if we find we fall in one
camp more than the other.

00:33:31.477 --> 00:33:34.079 align:middle line:84%
And in this-- it would--
this is a world of polarity.

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.581 align:middle line:90%
It's a universal polarity.

00:33:35.581 --> 00:33:39.852 align:middle line:84%
If we fall into the where we can
drop in, feel the large picture

00:33:39.852 --> 00:33:44.022 align:middle line:84%
and sustain a vision that
with feelings, with our love

00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:45.958 align:middle line:90%
and passion of a higher nature

00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:48.894 align:middle line:84%
of a higher outcome
that's very valuable.

00:33:48.894 --> 00:33:52.798 align:middle line:84%
If we find that we can hold
that higher vision but we hurt

00:33:52.798 --> 00:33:55.267 align:middle line:84%
and we're upset and
we want to just dig in

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:58.504 align:middle line:84%
and bring all our passion
to the table to help correct

00:33:58.504 --> 00:34:02.741 align:middle line:84%
in the trenches which causing
the issue, that's good too.

00:34:02.741 --> 00:34:05.144 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
need to embody both

00:34:05.144 --> 00:34:06.812 align:middle line:90%
if we're not capable at yet.

00:34:06.812 --> 00:34:08.613 align:middle line:90%
In the moment, do what we can.

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:11.517 align:middle line:84%
It's always perfect
to do what we can.

00:34:11.517 --> 00:34:15.787 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Well, we need to have so
much respect for how hard it is,

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:17.823 align:middle line:84%
and how complex it
is to be human being.

00:34:17.823 --> 00:34:18.657 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:34:18.657 --> 00:34:19.591 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: And everybody is dealt

00:34:19.591 --> 00:34:22.394 align:middle line:84%
such a unique hand
but in universe.

00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:25.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the great lessons is
to learn to look at the cards

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.132 align:middle line:84%
in your hand including the
ones that don't look so good.

00:34:27.132 --> 00:34:28.066 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:29.401 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: You know,
an abusive parent

00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:32.470 align:middle line:84%
or a tendency toward addiction
or bad skin or something,

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.839 align:middle line:84%
you know, that you
would say, "I don't want

00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:35.641 align:middle line:90%
that card in my hand."

00:34:35.641 --> 00:34:38.744 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've been dealt that
card so that you can learn

00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:41.146 align:middle line:84%
to play that hand as
well as it can be played.

00:34:41.146 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.682 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: And you can't be
compared to the person

00:34:43.682 --> 00:34:47.586 align:middle line:84%
who has dealt a different hand,
and learning to play the cards,

00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:51.423 align:middle line:84%
to forgive the cards, to
just say, "OK, this is it,

00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:55.727 align:middle line:84%
and my opportunity is to play
these cards as well as I can

00:34:55.727 --> 00:34:57.129 align:middle line:90%
until it rises to that."

00:34:57.129 --> 00:35:00.899 align:middle line:84%
There so much comparing of
ourselves to the rich and famous

00:35:00.899 --> 00:35:02.668 align:middle line:90%
and very gifted individual.

00:35:02.668 --> 00:35:03.735 align:middle line:84%

00:35:04.436 --> 00:35:05.070 align:middle line:90%

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.305 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: It is.

00:35:06.305 --> 00:35:08.974 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean one thing
that I think it's important

00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:14.179 align:middle line:84%
to understand for all of us is
that if you're rich and famous,

00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:17.950 align:middle line:84%
there are skills that you have
probably learned at some point

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:21.053 align:middle line:84%
through your lifetime or
lifetimes even to learn

00:35:21.053 --> 00:35:24.356 align:middle line:84%
to say acquire in managing
money in some case,

00:35:24.356 --> 00:35:29.294 align:middle line:84%
or to be comfortable in the
lime light in another case.

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:30.796 align:middle line:90%
This is just a skill set.

00:35:30.796 --> 00:35:34.600 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't mean
this-- that this is a--

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.469 align:middle line:84%
a person that is
necessarily highly advance

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:40.272 align:middle line:84%
in a spiritual way but
we have acknowledge

00:35:40.272 --> 00:35:42.507 align:middle line:84%
that those are skill sets
that they have well developed

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:44.476 align:middle line:84%
or they wouldn't be in
the position they are.

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:48.013 align:middle line:84%
And to, I think acknowledge
both is more appropriate

00:35:48.013 --> 00:35:51.183 align:middle line:84%
than to either demonize them
or put them on a pedestal.

00:35:51.183 --> 00:35:52.484 align:middle line:90%
That's a skill set.

00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:53.318 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: It's hard.

00:35:53.318 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to be rich and famous.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.321 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:35:56.321 --> 00:36:00.492 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: It-- The scrutiny, the
degrees of self-consciousness,

00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:04.529 align:middle line:84%
the standards that you
feel obliged to maintain,

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:09.167 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to be a person at
any-- in any configuration.

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:14.172 align:middle line:84%
And we tend all through often to
look at the peculiar limitations

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:17.643 align:middle line:84%
of our lives as if they're
nearly overwhelming.

00:36:17.643 --> 00:36:22.214 align:middle line:84%
But when we-- when we can get
that this life is a school

00:36:22.214 --> 00:36:24.850 align:middle line:84%
for everybody, and it's a
school for us right now,

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.551 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lesson
in this moment

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and there's an opportunity
in this moment.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:34.192 align:middle line:84%
And we get that there's a
grace in the picture that our--

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:36.795 align:middle line:84%
our lives however, difficult
they are have given us an

00:36:36.795 --> 00:36:40.699 align:middle line:84%
opportunity to show
up with as much love,

00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:43.669 align:middle line:84%
with as much awareness,
with as much presence,

00:36:43.669 --> 00:36:46.171 align:middle line:84%
with as much capacity,
much excellence

00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:48.073 align:middle line:90%
as we can in each moment.

00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:49.274 align:middle line:90%
It's an art you see.

00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:52.611 align:middle line:84%
The form of practice,
that-- I teach that.

00:36:52.611 --> 00:36:55.447 align:middle line:84%
That's a-- there's
a lot to that.

00:36:55.447 --> 00:37:00.352 align:middle line:84%
But art is you showing up and
not matter of you showing up,

00:37:00.352 --> 00:37:01.787 align:middle line:90%
it's different in each moment.

00:37:01.787 --> 00:37:03.722 align:middle line:84%
In one moment is about opening
in heart, another moment is

00:37:03.722 --> 00:37:06.158 align:middle line:84%
about insight, another
moment is moving your body

00:37:06.158 --> 00:37:10.696 align:middle line:84%
and bodily service to something
in very practical terms.

00:37:10.696 --> 00:37:13.665 align:middle line:84%
It always involves
breaking the mold.

00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:15.567 align:middle line:84%
It's like breaking
the social taboo.

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.670 align:middle line:84%
You break the kind
of hypnotic table

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.574 align:middle line:84%
of your own momentum
and actually show up.

00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:24.609 align:middle line:90%
This is-- This is the key.

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:28.013 align:middle line:90%
The cult is about becoming numb.

00:37:28.013 --> 00:37:33.018 align:middle line:84%
The cult is about becoming flat,
dead end, beginning to lift--

00:37:33.018 --> 00:37:33.785 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Of an autopilot.

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:35.187 align:middle line:90%

to happen in every one of us.

00:37:38.857 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
It's-- My teacher
originally would call it the

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.562 align:middle line:90%
"self-contraction".

00:37:43.562 --> 00:37:46.698 align:middle line:84%
It's the way in which awareness
calls in upon itself and kind

00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:48.700 align:middle line:90%
of forgets its nature.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.703 align:middle line:84%
But who it is that
is experiencing this,

00:37:51.703 --> 00:37:56.074 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence that sparked
that's inside each moment

00:37:56.074 --> 00:37:58.143 align:middle line:84%
in which you can
recognize in a moment.

00:37:58.143 --> 00:37:59.277 align:middle line:90%
Just a brief moment.

00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:01.413 align:middle line:84%
There is that recognition,
"Oh, yeah, wait."

00:38:01.413 --> 00:38:03.248 align:middle line:84%
The brightness itself,
the brightness

00:38:03.248 --> 00:38:04.883 align:middle line:90%
of awareness that is free.

00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:06.551 align:middle line:90%
That is infinitely created.

00:38:06.551 --> 00:38:08.286 align:middle line:84%
That is a source of
courage of the inside.

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:09.488 align:middle line:90%

00:38:15.527 --> 00:38:17.829 align:middle line:84%
And that could assert
itself always.

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:19.197 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:21.166 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: And we need to cooperate
with that in the recognition

00:38:21.166 --> 00:38:24.069 align:middle line:84%
that that's not just an
inner spiritual journey.

00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:26.972 align:middle line:84%
That's the business of
every moment of life.

00:38:26.972 --> 00:38:30.442 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: There's a-- there was
a statement made once quite a

00:38:30.442 --> 00:38:33.078 align:middle line:84%
while ago by someone I
though was so brilliant.

00:38:33.078 --> 00:38:35.781 align:middle line:84%
It was talking about
the presence of the--

00:38:35.781 --> 00:38:37.282 align:middle line:90%
what we call the conscious mind

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:39.951 align:middle line:84%
which of course is the least
conscious aspect of ourselves.

00:38:39.951 --> 00:38:41.119 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the subconscious

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:43.522 align:middle line:84%
and super-conscious,
IE, spirit soul,

00:38:43.522 --> 00:38:45.257 align:middle line:90%
we can it whatever we like.

00:38:45.257 --> 00:38:48.593 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that the
conscious mind was originally

00:38:48.593 --> 00:38:52.931 align:middle line:84%
developed to keep you
from bumping into things.

00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:57.068 align:middle line:84%
And very simply put
where these other body

00:38:57.068 --> 00:39:01.406 align:middle line:84%
of the super-conscious was
the way to live through life

00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:03.875 align:middle line:84%
to create, to experience
each other,

00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:07.112 align:middle line:84%
but the conscious mind simply
grew into a little beast

00:39:07.112 --> 00:39:08.914 align:middle line:84%
that took over and now
we live within that.

00:39:08.914 --> 00:39:10.515 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
subconscious place

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:13.084 align:middle line:84%
out its little programs that
we're stocked in day-to-day.

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And I though it was really,
really way to put it enough

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.222 align:middle line:90%
that I never forgot that.

00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It was only there to keep
us from bumping into things.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.791 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:23.261 align:middle line:84%
And now that muscle is so
strong, it's basically--

00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:24.262 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Exactly.

00:39:24.262 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- obliterated
our connection

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.064 align:middle line:90%
with the super conscious.

00:39:26.064 --> 00:39:28.233 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Well, there's
another modeling.

00:39:28.233 --> 00:39:29.935 align:middle line:84%
There's many ways I'm
talking about this

00:39:29.935 --> 00:39:32.971 align:middle line:84%
and these terms are
useful but, you know,

00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:34.773 align:middle line:84%
we can use different
terms in another moment.

00:39:34.773 --> 00:39:36.842 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends has
made a different--

00:39:36.842 --> 00:39:39.478 align:middle line:84%
distinction between
masculine consciousness,

00:39:39.478 --> 00:39:42.380 align:middle line:84%
he likes to call it which is
subject object consciousness.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.083 align:middle line:84%
We separate ourselves from
something in order to see,

00:39:45.083 --> 00:39:47.052 align:middle line:90%
and feminine consciousness.

00:39:47.052 --> 00:39:50.555 align:middle line:84%
This formulation is
just being with what is.

00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:52.591 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that way
of looking at it,

00:39:52.591 --> 00:39:54.259 align:middle line:90%
we need to be able to do both.

00:39:54.259 --> 00:39:57.729 align:middle line:84%
We need to be able to just--
for me to just be with you,

00:39:57.729 --> 00:40:03.201 align:middle line:84%
to just contemplate and take
in the humanity and divinity

00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:05.303 align:middle line:90%
of your being and just for you

00:40:05.303 --> 00:40:08.306 align:middle line:84%
to actually have me
present receiving in.

00:40:08.306 --> 00:40:10.308 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge gift.

00:40:10.308 --> 00:40:13.078 align:middle line:84%
It's also good if
I can look at you,

00:40:13.078 --> 00:40:14.479 align:middle line:90%
understand what you're saying,

00:40:14.479 --> 00:40:17.949 align:middle line:84%
compare that with other ideas
make discriminations, response--

00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:19.985 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: -- intelligently.

00:40:19.985 --> 00:40:22.787 align:middle line:84%
Both have value but it's a
breathing in and breathing out.

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.122 align:middle line:90%
We need both of them.

00:40:24.122 --> 00:40:28.093 align:middle line:84%
But in our society for
thousands of years now,

00:40:28.093 --> 00:40:30.195 align:middle line:84%
the masculine mode
has been rewarded

00:40:30.195 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:90%
and the feminine mode has not.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.365 align:middle line:90%
And in that analysis,

00:40:33.365 --> 00:40:36.401 align:middle line:84%
we've essentially become
hyper masculine instead

00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:37.769 align:middle line:84%
of breathing in and
breathing out.

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:40.105 align:middle line:84%
We're pinned to the
one side of that--

00:40:40.105 --> 00:40:40.906 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:40:40.906 --> 00:40:42.007 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: -- polarity and only

00:40:42.007 --> 00:40:45.544 align:middle line:84%
that hyper masculine
mode gets reinforcement.

00:40:45.544 --> 00:40:47.779 align:middle line:90%
And we're all dealing--

00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:50.048 align:middle line:84%
you might say the
symptoms of the disease

00:40:50.048 --> 00:40:54.586 align:middle line:84%
of that hyper masculine fixation
to simply allow ourselves to be

00:40:54.586 --> 00:40:58.356 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, to be
with our own experience,

00:40:58.356 --> 00:41:02.527 align:middle line:84%
to be with our loved ones,
to take in his breath,

00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:07.632 align:middle line:84%
to take in the miracle of this
moment, to take in the beauty

00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:12.504 align:middle line:84%
of your smile, to
actually feel the heart

00:41:12.504 --> 00:41:14.206 align:middle line:90%
that is always present.

00:41:14.206 --> 00:41:15.974 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:19.744 align:middle line:84%
OK. Now, let's go into the
unhealthy aspect of activism

00:41:19.744 --> 00:41:23.882 align:middle line:84%
and you call it anxiety
produced activism.

00:41:23.882 --> 00:41:25.217 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:41:25.217 --> 00:41:27.152 align:middle line:84%
It's where we're not-- where
you were just a moment ago.

00:41:27.152 --> 00:41:29.321 align:middle line:84%
We're not breathing in
and we're not breathing

00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:33.258 align:middle line:84%
out in this wonderful flow
between the two aspects mind.

00:41:33.258 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we seem to have gotten
stocked into something else.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.264 align:middle line:84%
So, what is anxiety
produced activism?

00:41:39.264 --> 00:41:42.334 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Most of the activism that
you all are aware of that we see

00:41:42.334 --> 00:41:44.703 align:middle line:84%
on the TV everyday,
most of the marches,

00:41:44.703 --> 00:41:48.340 align:middle line:84%
most of the impassioning
speeches, most of the protests,

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:53.712 align:middle line:84%
most of the political action
committees, most of the NGOs

00:41:53.712 --> 00:41:58.917 align:middle line:84%
that are celebrating a cause
are tending to buy the dilemma.,

00:41:58.917 --> 00:42:00.952 align:middle line:90%
the problem that the--

00:42:00.952 --> 00:42:03.388 align:middle line:84%
and there's a place where we
get very over up [phonetic].

00:42:03.388 --> 00:42:06.358 align:middle line:84%
We believe the problem
so strongly

00:42:06.358 --> 00:42:11.162 align:middle line:84%
that that becomes a dominating
thing shaping our consciousness.

00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:15.233 align:middle line:84%
An activism based on that
recreates its premise.

00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:16.735 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, reinforces the
same [multiple speaker].

00:42:16.735 --> 00:42:20.105 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: When we bring that
unhappiness, that anxiety

00:42:20.105 --> 00:42:23.475 align:middle line:84%
that it's a victim
psychology very often.

00:42:23.475 --> 00:42:26.411 align:middle line:84%
You know, the problem with
victim psychology is when I fell

00:42:26.411 --> 00:42:28.747 align:middle line:84%
like I am the victim
of other things.

00:42:28.747 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm focusing on everybody
else's power

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.286 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think I
have any as the victim.

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:39.824 align:middle line:84%
Well, in so many of these
dynamic, we're buying that.

00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:42.394 align:middle line:84%
As activists, we're buying
into that kind of psychology.

00:42:42.394 --> 00:42:46.498 align:middle line:84%
You have to make that move
from victim to creator.

00:42:46.498 --> 00:42:47.599 align:middle line:90%
We are created.

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:49.401 align:middle line:84%
Even if there are
many, many factors

00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:51.503 align:middle line:84%
that victimize people
and there are.

00:42:51.503 --> 00:42:54.606 align:middle line:84%
And people deserve
compassion, and care.

00:42:54.606 --> 00:42:57.442 align:middle line:90%
But we all need to find our way

00:42:57.442 --> 00:43:00.445 align:middle line:84%
to our places creators
not just as victims.

00:43:00.445 --> 00:43:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And our way of active--
actively engaging the world

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:10.155 align:middle line:84%
in sacred bases has to be
basically lit by the joy

00:43:10.155 --> 00:43:15.293 align:middle line:84%
of our communion with the source
of life which is always present.

00:43:15.293 --> 00:43:16.861 align:middle line:90%
I had a big moment.

00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:19.864 align:middle line:84%
I was raised to be an
activist actually, Regina.

00:43:19.864 --> 00:43:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a-- in a racial
community back in the 60s.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:29.808 align:middle line:84%
I came of age when the Vietnam
War thing was still going on.

00:43:29.808 --> 00:43:31.076 align:middle line:90%
I marched.

00:43:31.076 --> 00:43:33.845 align:middle line:84%
I led. I remember leading
a crowed of 3,000 students

00:43:33.845 --> 00:43:37.082 align:middle line:84%
to march around President
Fleming's home at the University

00:43:37.082 --> 00:43:39.651 align:middle line:84%
of Michigan and Ann Arbor,
and we were wanting them

00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:42.454 align:middle line:84%
to divest their investments
in South Africa.

00:43:42.454 --> 00:43:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And at certain point I saw
this window open up and--

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.659 align:middle line:84%
well, I saw an open
window begin to close.

00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:48.927 align:middle line:90%
So, a woman's arm reached over

00:43:48.927 --> 00:43:50.228 align:middle line:84%
and I could see her
face, and I could see.

00:43:50.228 --> 00:43:52.497 align:middle line:84%
She was just feeling
threatened and anxious,

00:43:52.497 --> 00:43:54.899 align:middle line:84%
and she pulled the drape
as we were marching

00:43:54.899 --> 00:43:58.837 align:middle line:84%
around for home--
probably, his wife.

00:43:58.837 --> 00:44:03.608 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I didn't
really know how much power he

00:44:03.608 --> 00:44:06.711 align:middle line:84%
had over the investments
of the university.

00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:09.681 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know the
circumstance of her life.

00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:12.917 align:middle line:84%
And I as a pretty
arrogant adolescent though

00:44:12.917 --> 00:44:18.723 align:middle line:84%
that I had a righteous basis for
kind of tormenting this woman.

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:21.025 align:middle line:84%
But in the-- just a human
confrontation of me marching

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.827 align:middle line:84%
around the home and
seeing her that,

00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:24.996 align:middle line:84%
and I've gotten everybody
to march on his own.

00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:25.764 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:44:25.764 --> 00:44:26.731 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: I actually done it.

00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:27.565 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:28.566 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: So, I knew-- and I knew

00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:32.303 align:middle line:84%
that I was an arrogant
adolescent punk

00:44:32.303 --> 00:44:34.038 align:middle line:84%
that I hadn't taken
at all into account.

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:36.775 align:middle line:84%
And that if there was
going to be a revolution

00:44:36.775 --> 00:44:40.145 align:middle line:84%
that was really going to change
things, it had to begin with me.

00:44:40.145 --> 00:44:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, how would you
have reframed that with--

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.316 align:middle line:90%
from a mature perspective?

00:44:45.316 --> 00:44:46.384 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Well--

00:44:46.384 --> 00:44:47.318 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The same--
let's put yourself back

00:44:47.318 --> 00:44:49.354 align:middle line:84%
in that situation
and reframe it.

00:44:49.354 --> 00:44:53.758 align:middle line:84%
What would you have done from
where you-- what you know now.

00:44:53.758 --> 00:44:54.959 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: You know, it's funny.

00:44:54.959 --> 00:44:57.228 align:middle line:90%
I don't tend to think that way.

00:44:57.228 --> 00:45:00.231 align:middle line:84%
Let's me see if I can play
with that thought experiment.

00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:04.502 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I think that in
the, you know, in reality,

00:45:04.502 --> 00:45:06.671 align:middle line:84%
I think everything was
perfect that the best thing

00:45:06.671 --> 00:45:08.506 align:middle line:84%
that could have happened
is what happened.

00:45:08.506 --> 00:45:10.875 align:middle line:84%
We did what did, she
had the confrontation.

00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:13.144 align:middle line:84%
The president had the
confrontation and the board

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:16.981 align:middle line:84%
of regents or whoever decided
on their investments realized

00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:19.017 align:middle line:84%
that the poor guy was out
there in the front line--

00:45:19.017 --> 00:45:20.051 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:45:20.051 --> 00:45:20.885 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: -- and they
had to deal with it.

00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And I have the insight I had.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.421 align:middle line:84%
And my life is going
on the very best.

00:45:23.421 --> 00:45:24.122 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:45:24.122 --> 00:45:24.656 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: It's all perfect.

00:45:24.656 --> 00:45:25.723 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:28.293 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: But certainly
now, I'm interested

00:45:28.293 --> 00:45:31.162 align:middle line:84%
in the different kinds of
activism in which people engage

00:45:31.162 --> 00:45:35.467 align:middle line:84%
with one another in a way that's
profoundly deep spiritually

00:45:35.467 --> 00:45:38.036 align:middle line:84%
and intimately which the inner
work is really being done

00:45:38.036 --> 00:45:41.272 align:middle line:84%
and the outer work is
connected to that in a work.

00:45:41.272 --> 00:45:44.108 align:middle line:84%
In which we really
endeavor to walk our talk.

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:45.410 align:middle line:90%
We never had the arrogance

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:47.512 align:middle line:84%
of thinking we're
perfectly walking our talk.

00:45:47.512 --> 00:45:50.215 align:middle line:84%
We always have to walk
it better and better.

00:45:50.215 --> 00:45:51.583 align:middle line:90%
And there's a process

00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:55.420 align:middle line:84%
of becoming more spiritualized
beings who are also engaged

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.489 align:middle line:84%
in the world, who have a
responsibility at the level

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:00.291 align:middle line:84%
of the transformation
of the world

00:46:00.291 --> 00:46:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that even has a political
dimension.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.029 align:middle line:84%
But much of our activism
can be in a form

00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:07.532 align:middle line:90%
of creating the technologies,

00:46:07.532 --> 00:46:09.734 align:middle line:84%
or creating new communications
tools,

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:11.569 align:middle line:84%
or even creating
the kinds of art,

00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:16.107 align:middle line:84%
or changing the way
the spirituality is in,

00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:19.811 align:middle line:84%
there are thousands and
thousands and thousands of ways

00:46:19.811 --> 00:46:22.247 align:middle line:90%
that we can create the elements.

00:46:22.247 --> 00:46:23.948 align:middle line:84%
You might call them
the spare parts out of

00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:28.853 align:middle line:84%
which we can build a new society
in which this species can live

00:46:28.853 --> 00:46:31.990 align:middle line:84%
in a sustainable
relationship to the earth

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:36.294 align:middle line:84%
in which we can have real
opportunity and justice

00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:37.629 align:middle line:90%
for everybody on the planet,

00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:40.732 align:middle line:84%
in which life can be spiritually
fulfilling for everybody.

00:46:40.732 --> 00:46:44.669 align:middle line:84%
We're building the spare parts
in our projects right now.

00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:46.971 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, you know,
there will be calamities.

00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:48.406 align:middle line:90%
There will be crises.

00:46:48.406 --> 00:46:49.807 align:middle line:90%
And during some of those crises,

00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:51.609 align:middle line:84%
windows of opportunities
will open

00:46:51.609 --> 00:46:55.079 align:middle line:84%
up for more fundamental
systems redesigned.

00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:56.648 align:middle line:84%
And some of us need
to be thinking

00:46:56.648 --> 00:46:59.317 align:middle line:84%
with great foresight
about all of that.

00:46:59.317 --> 00:47:03.087 align:middle line:84%
So, there are so many creative
projects we can be undertaking.

00:47:03.087 --> 00:47:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But the way I look at it,
it's a three-part strategy.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.493 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the
Ancient Chinese pattern

00:47:08.493 --> 00:47:12.363 align:middle line:84%
that there was a sage
advising the emperor.

00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:14.399 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
great Chinese ages

00:47:14.399 --> 00:47:16.501 align:middle line:84%
that we all remember
the name of Bodhidharma,

00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:18.569 align:middle line:90%
the guy with the big eyebrows.

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:21.873 align:middle line:84%
Well, first we need
to become Bodhidharma.

00:47:21.873 --> 00:47:23.641 align:middle line:90%
We need-- We need to awaken.

00:47:23.641 --> 00:47:26.044 align:middle line:84%
Then we need to do
all the things.

00:47:26.044 --> 00:47:28.379 align:middle line:84%
We need-- We need to come
up with all the solutions,

00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:31.549 align:middle line:84%
all the millions of
forms of activism

00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:32.684 align:middle line:90%
that I was just referring to.

00:47:32.684 --> 00:47:34.686 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: In collaboration.

00:47:34.686 --> 00:47:39.357 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: And-- and-- and-- and
gain the ear of the emperor.

00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:44.128 align:middle line:84%
That is we need to change
our relationship to power.

00:47:44.128 --> 00:47:47.865 align:middle line:84%
It isn't enough to
speak truth to power.

00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:51.269 align:middle line:84%
We have to actually
begin to be willing

00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:54.038 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility
for this world.

00:47:54.038 --> 00:47:58.376 align:middle line:84%
When you awaken in this world,
you begin to realize that you're

00:47:58.376 --> 00:48:02.513 align:middle line:84%
in a great room with
many, many children.

00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:04.682 align:middle line:84%
As you awaken, it's
like becoming an adult.

00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:08.586 align:middle line:84%
This human species is
going to its adolescence.

00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to become an
awaked adult, you look around

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:15.927 align:middle line:84%
and you see that,
these kids they have--

00:48:15.927 --> 00:48:17.462 align:middle line:90%
they don't just have guns,

00:48:17.462 --> 00:48:20.298 align:middle line:84%
they have ridiculously
powerful weapons.

00:48:20.298 --> 00:48:23.134 align:middle line:84%
They're actually raping
and killing one another.

00:48:23.134 --> 00:48:27.372 align:middle line:84%
This is a map, and you look
around as an adult for the eyes

00:48:27.372 --> 00:48:32.010 align:middle line:84%
of other adults, other clear
eyes that see what you see.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:37.348 align:middle line:84%
And those eyes meet,
you realize, "Oh,

00:48:37.348 --> 00:48:39.384 align:middle line:84%
we adults have a
responsibility to do

00:48:39.384 --> 00:48:40.652 align:middle line:90%
to bring order to this room."

00:48:40.652 --> 00:48:42.253 align:middle line:84%
We need to take care
of the kids.

00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:44.789 align:middle line:84%
We need to find a way to
separate them from their weapons

00:48:44.789 --> 00:48:45.923 align:middle line:90%
and turn this into a place

00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:48.192 align:middle line:84%
where they can finish
growing up and thrive.

00:48:48.192 --> 00:48:50.194 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And it's interesting
because it--

00:48:50.194 --> 00:48:52.830 align:middle line:84%
well, as you were talking when
you were young during the 60s,

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:57.902 align:middle line:84%
70s, there was a spirit and
even astrologically plotted

00:48:57.902 --> 00:48:59.137 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:48:59.137 --> 00:49:02.173 align:middle line:84%
A spirit of revolution that
comes around cyclically.

00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:05.476 align:middle line:84%
A very similar kind of
astrological confluence

00:49:05.476 --> 00:49:07.712 align:middle line:84%
of events is happening
right now.

00:49:07.712 --> 00:49:09.280 align:middle line:90%
But you're-- but you're just--

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.885 align:middle line:84%
you just said is now we
address it in a more mature way

00:49:13.885 --> 00:49:17.388 align:middle line:84%
and we address it perhaps more
with the influence of the heart

00:49:17.388 --> 00:49:21.325 align:middle line:84%
than just confrontation as
we did a few decades ago.

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:22.593 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Yeah.

00:49:22.593 --> 00:49:24.429 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you, in fact,
this is a nice little segway.

00:49:24.429 --> 00:49:26.531 align:middle line:90%
And I love what you just said.

00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:28.466 align:middle line:84%
You actually work
with Heartmath.

00:49:28.466 --> 00:49:31.169 align:middle line:84%
And so, I would like to know
some of what you learned

00:49:31.169 --> 00:49:34.405 align:middle line:84%
about that connection that
heart-brain connection

00:49:34.405 --> 00:49:38.242 align:middle line:84%
and its place in our world even
through activism if you want

00:49:38.242 --> 00:49:40.278 align:middle line:84%
to run it through
that lens [phonetic].

00:49:40.278 --> 00:49:44.816 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Well, you know,
the way that I teach now--

00:49:44.816 --> 00:49:47.719 align:middle line:84%
with Heartmath, what I did
is I was the Project Manager

00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:50.254 align:middle line:84%
for the development of
their first Heart Rate

00:49:50.254 --> 00:49:51.889 align:middle line:90%
Variability Monitor.

00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:53.624 align:middle line:90%
As we call it the freeze-framer.

00:49:53.624 --> 00:49:56.094 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think they call
it the MYF [phonetic].

00:49:56.094 --> 00:49:58.796 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- it was
wonderful to work with them

00:49:58.796 --> 00:50:01.666 align:middle line:84%
because they understood
some very,

00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:03.968 align:middle line:90%
very important basic things.

00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:08.172 align:middle line:84%
The way in which
appreciation and care,

00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:11.109 align:middle line:90%
very simple basic hard emotions.

00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:14.512 align:middle line:84%
We regulated our system
and create coherence.

00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:20.318 align:middle line:84%
And their core to the
way I teach now, you--

00:50:20.318 --> 00:50:24.989 align:middle line:84%
when we talked earlier,
I mentioned to you

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:28.826 align:middle line:84%
that I use five M words
to describe the form

00:50:28.826 --> 00:50:34.932 align:middle line:84%
of the practice that I teach;
mornings, moments, mission,

00:50:34.932 --> 00:50:37.835 align:middle line:90%
milestones, and momentum.

00:50:37.835 --> 00:50:41.672 align:middle line:84%
By mornings, I mean a
daily practice of movement

00:50:41.672 --> 00:50:44.475 align:middle line:90%
and stillness meditation.

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:47.812 align:middle line:84%
By moments, I mean waking
up and doing variety

00:50:47.812 --> 00:50:49.914 align:middle line:84%
of different practices but
the practice that you do

00:50:49.914 --> 00:50:51.816 align:middle line:84%
in a moment in the
midst of life.

00:50:51.816 --> 00:50:53.718 align:middle line:84%
And I was referring
to that a lot earlier

00:50:53.718 --> 00:50:55.786 align:middle line:90%
in this conversation.

00:50:55.786 --> 00:51:00.024 align:middle line:84%
Basically, many forms of
spiritual practice forget

00:51:00.024 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:84%
to talk about how
it has to happen

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.530 align:middle line:84%
in brief moments many
times all day long.

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:07.465 align:middle line:84%
Our whole life needs
to be our practice

00:51:07.465 --> 00:51:09.534 align:middle line:90%
and some moment says core.

00:51:09.534 --> 00:51:13.838 align:middle line:84%
Mission has to do with how
the uniqueness of you relates

00:51:13.838 --> 00:51:17.675 align:middle line:84%
to some larger service
that you're here to do

00:51:17.675 --> 00:51:20.244 align:middle line:84%
and really understanding that
so you know the true north

00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:21.979 align:middle line:90%
by which to navigate.

00:51:21.979 --> 00:51:24.081 align:middle line:90%
Milestones are your projects

00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:26.117 align:middle line:84%
like this show is a
milestones practice

00:51:26.117 --> 00:51:28.553 align:middle line:90%
for you creating it each day.

00:51:28.553 --> 00:51:31.455 align:middle line:84%
If you relate to your milestones
practice in three ways,

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:34.125 align:middle line:84%
it becomes really
self transcending.

00:51:34.125 --> 00:51:36.327 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, I'm
doing it in service

00:51:36.327 --> 00:51:38.529 align:middle line:84%
to something greater
than myself.

00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:41.265 align:middle line:84%
Two is, I'm co-creating
it with a power greater

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:43.668 align:middle line:90%
than my own creature power.

00:51:43.668 --> 00:51:46.437 align:middle line:84%
And three is, I'm doing
it with willingness

00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:48.005 align:middle line:90%
for it to transform me.

00:51:48.005 --> 00:51:51.142 align:middle line:84%
May the one who completes
this project be different

00:51:51.142 --> 00:51:52.910 align:middle line:90%
than the one who began it.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:54.645 align:middle line:90%
That's your milestones practice.

00:51:54.645 --> 00:51:58.216 align:middle line:84%
And then by momentum, I actually
mean all of the other practices

00:51:58.216 --> 00:52:00.918 align:middle line:84%
that are part of life
that I kind of wrote

00:52:00.918 --> 00:52:04.355 align:middle line:84%
about with Ken Wilber in the
book "Integral Life Practice".

00:52:04.355 --> 00:52:07.959 align:middle line:84%
So that includes all the spheres
of our life, our body practices

00:52:07.959 --> 00:52:11.195 align:middle line:84%
with which could be, you know,
running and biking and hiking

00:52:11.195 --> 00:52:14.232 align:middle line:84%
and all of the things that we
do for our physical fitness,

00:52:14.232 --> 00:52:16.701 align:middle line:84%
our diet, all of
those body practices,

00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:20.204 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual practices,
our meditative practices.

00:52:20.204 --> 00:52:25.243 align:middle line:84%
There're mind practices, study,
the audios, and shows like this

00:52:25.243 --> 00:52:28.713 align:middle line:84%
that clarify our
mental understanding.

00:52:28.713 --> 00:52:31.215 align:middle line:84%
There's our psychological
work, our shadow work,

00:52:31.215 --> 00:52:32.583 align:middle line:90%
our development of our souls.

00:52:32.583 --> 00:52:35.753 align:middle line:84%
There's our interpersonal
practice in our intimacies

00:52:35.753 --> 00:52:39.323 align:middle line:84%
and with our family, and also
in our public relationships

00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:41.158 align:middle line:90%
at work and as citizens.

00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.727 align:middle line:90%
So, all those are spheres

00:52:42.727 --> 00:52:45.529 align:middle line:84%
and there's an integral cross
training among them that is

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:47.932 align:middle line:84%
when you're breaking up
stockiness in your body

00:52:47.932 --> 00:52:50.001 align:middle line:84%
and you're breaking up
stockiness on the cushion,

00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:52.370 align:middle line:90%
you grow in both more quickly.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:54.171 align:middle line:84%
People who take up
weight lifting,

00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:55.640 align:middle line:90%
actually progress faster

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.541 align:middle line:84%
in their meditation
practice then people

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:58.876 align:middle line:90%
who don't oddly enough--

00:52:58.876 --> 00:52:59.877 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:52:59.877 --> 00:53:00.411 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: -- when you
look at the study.

00:53:00.411 --> 00:53:01.779 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:53:01.779 --> 00:53:03.114 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: So, that principle of
integral cross training is a key

00:53:03.114 --> 00:53:04.882 align:middle line:90%
to the way I teach too.

00:53:04.882 --> 00:53:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:06.851 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's holistic.

00:53:06.851 --> 00:53:10.855 align:middle line:84%
In the big picture-- there
was one thing I wanted

00:53:10.855 --> 00:53:13.791 align:middle line:84%
to get your take on before
we leave the whole subject

00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:14.925 align:middle line:90%
of Heartmath behind.

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:17.395 align:middle line:84%
It was-- and we talked
about this off camera

00:53:17.395 --> 00:53:20.865 align:middle line:84%
that what had intrigued you most
and you found very validating--

00:53:20.865 --> 00:53:21.699 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Yeah.

00:53:21.699 --> 00:53:23.701 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, is that oftentimes--

00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:25.069 align:middle line:84%
please explained
these phenomena.

00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:27.138 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: Yeah, well, there's some
wonderful research that roll

00:53:27.138 --> 00:53:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other scientist
that Heartmath did having

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.778 align:middle line:84%
to do with-- doing
very, very fine tests

00:53:33.778 --> 00:53:39.950 align:middle line:84%
of when the physiology of
human beings registers events.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:44.088 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered
that the first system

00:53:44.088 --> 00:53:46.123 align:middle line:90%
that registers choices

00:53:46.123 --> 00:53:50.494 align:middle line:84%
and senses things is actually
the neurocardiology even before

00:53:50.494 --> 00:53:51.295 align:middle line:90%
the brain that--

00:53:51.295 --> 00:53:52.496 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:53:52.496 --> 00:53:55.032 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: -- our first
perception is hear not here.

00:53:55.032 --> 00:53:58.469 align:middle line:84%
But even more interestingly,
there are many things

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:03.674 align:middle line:84%
that are anticipated, that is
before the event takes place is

00:54:03.674 --> 00:54:07.345 align:middle line:84%
registered here, that is
we actually are psychic

00:54:07.345 --> 00:54:10.448 align:middle line:84%
that there is-- there is
anticipatory awareness.

00:54:10.448 --> 00:54:12.583 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that is important for us

00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:14.185 align:middle line:90%
to understand is the reason

00:54:14.185 --> 00:54:16.854 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is
feeling like, "Whoa!

00:54:16.854 --> 00:54:18.222 align:middle line:90%
This is game time.

00:54:18.222 --> 00:54:20.858 align:middle line:84%
This is," you know, if I've
becoming more conscious all my

00:54:20.858 --> 00:54:23.027 align:middle line:84%
life, this is the time
to bring it into action

00:54:23.027 --> 00:54:25.863 align:middle line:84%
that the sense that
now is the time.

00:54:25.863 --> 00:54:27.131 align:middle line:90%
Other ages thought they--

00:54:27.131 --> 00:54:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that they were living
in a time that was it.

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.034 align:middle line:90%
No, they were wrong.

00:54:30.034 --> 00:54:31.235 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:54:31.235 --> 00:54:33.838 align:middle line:84%
That sense is something
that we're--

00:54:33.838 --> 00:54:37.775 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all getting
in anticipation of something

00:54:37.775 --> 00:54:41.812 align:middle line:84%
that we're being called forth
in the service right now.

00:54:41.812 --> 00:54:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Our hearts, our sensing
mechanisms are sensing something

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:49.653 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't even happened yet
and we're all kind of it's

00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:52.923 align:middle line:84%
like the triad is gathering to
do the work we're meant to do.

00:54:52.923 --> 00:54:54.025 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and it
creates a sense

00:54:54.025 --> 00:54:55.659 align:middle line:90%
of anticipation on one hand.

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:58.596 align:middle line:84%
In some people, it
produces a sense of anxiety

00:54:58.596 --> 00:55:01.232 align:middle line:84%
because we're already
catching the future wave.

00:55:01.232 --> 00:55:04.301 align:middle line:84%
And I was in an experiment
that was conducted

00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:05.236 align:middle line:90%
by Dean Regan [assumed spelling]

00:55:05.236 --> 00:55:07.471 align:middle line:84%
at one point in a
group of people.

00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:09.273 align:middle line:84%
And one of his colleagues
was there.

00:55:09.273 --> 00:55:11.509 align:middle line:84%
I think they may have
been conducting it.

00:55:11.509 --> 00:55:13.611 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very simple one.

00:55:13.611 --> 00:55:17.314 align:middle line:84%
An image is going to pop-up one
side of the screen or the other,

00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:25.122 align:middle line:84%
and you are to click your answer
right or left before it appears.

00:55:25.122 --> 00:55:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And that particular group of
people was amazing the accuracy

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.130 align:middle line:84%
with which some people are
up to 80, 85, even 90 percent

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:36.801 align:middle line:84%
in their accuracy of where
the image was going to appear.

00:55:36.801 --> 00:55:38.469 align:middle line:84%
And again, this thing
you're talking about,

00:55:38.469 --> 00:55:40.404 align:middle line:84%
it's the heart that's
intercepting

00:55:40.404 --> 00:55:43.741 align:middle line:90%
that pre-information first.

00:55:43.741 --> 00:55:47.812 align:middle line:84%
And so, to understand what you
just said, we are all psychic,

00:55:47.812 --> 00:55:49.814 align:middle line:84%
all of us are beginning
to feel this.

00:55:49.814 --> 00:55:51.916 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that mean
that we have to engage

00:55:51.916 --> 00:55:56.020 align:middle line:84%
in a very real authentic loving
way with whether it's anxiety

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.956 align:middle line:84%
or anticipation and maybe
ask some deeper questions?

00:55:58.956 --> 00:56:01.759 align:middle line:84%
Maybe like those coons you
were talking about earlier.

00:56:01.759 --> 00:56:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Yeah.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:10.734 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all we-- the
first thing that is required

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:16.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to cope well in
anxiety is to not make it wrong.

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:19.109 align:middle line:84%
We've got to just allow
that anxiety to be there

00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:24.014 align:middle line:84%
and become curious and self
compassionate in relation to it.

00:56:24.014 --> 00:56:28.919 align:middle line:84%
It will transform but it will
only transform if it's welcomed,

00:56:28.919 --> 00:56:31.755 align:middle line:84%
if we're friendly, if
we in words of rooming.

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Is therefore--

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:34.024 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: We've would greet at
the door laughing, you know.

00:56:34.024 --> 00:56:34.725 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:35.559 align:middle line:90%
It's there for a reason.

00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:36.594 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: It is there for a reason.

00:56:36.594 --> 00:56:37.528 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's trying
to get our attention

00:56:37.528 --> 00:56:38.762 align:middle line:84%
for a reason that
knows something.

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:40.364 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: Exactly.

00:56:40.364 --> 00:56:47.171 align:middle line:84%
So, this is-- that that's key
and then let's though face it

00:56:47.171 --> 00:56:49.073 align:middle line:84%
that anxiety is building
and that sense

00:56:49.073 --> 00:56:51.876 align:middle line:84%
of anticipation is building
because we're facing

00:56:51.876 --> 00:56:52.977 align:middle line:90%
such profound questions.

00:56:52.977 --> 00:56:56.180 align:middle line:84%
How can this globally
interconnected world

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.482 align:middle line:84%
with all the systems that we
have which many of which are

00:56:58.482 --> 00:57:02.786 align:middle line:84%
in crises which seemed
to be in a stuck place.

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:05.022 align:middle line:84%
We're all kind of
sleepwalking into what seems

00:57:05.022 --> 00:57:07.258 align:middle line:84%
like it maybe a disaster
with global warming,

00:57:07.258 --> 00:57:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and mass extinctions, and
strange weather events,

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.863 align:middle line:84%
and crop failures, and
breakdowns of financial

00:57:12.863 --> 00:57:14.798 align:middle line:84%
and educational, and
so many different kinds

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:16.367 align:middle line:90%
of institutions, you know.

00:57:16.367 --> 00:57:20.738 align:middle line:84%
That is a question
that we're all facing.

00:57:20.738 --> 00:57:24.108 align:middle line:84%
It's an impossible
question that is growing us

00:57:24.108 --> 00:57:27.044 align:middle line:84%
like Rilca [assumed spelling]
wrote to the young poet,

00:57:27.044 --> 00:57:30.080 align:middle line:84%
"Love the questions, live
the questions let them

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.115 align:middle line:90%
transform you."

00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:33.584 align:middle line:90%
That's what a Rinzai monk does

00:57:33.584 --> 00:57:36.287 align:middle line:84%
when he can't make his
way through his coon.

00:57:36.287 --> 00:57:38.455 align:middle line:84%
He lets the coon
transform his consciousness.

00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:40.691 align:middle line:84%
We have a big question,
all of us,

00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:44.128 align:middle line:84%
millions of us are
facing this big question.

00:57:44.128 --> 00:57:46.931 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take all
of us responding to it

00:57:46.931 --> 00:57:49.333 align:middle line:90%
as practitioners and letting

00:57:49.333 --> 00:57:51.936 align:middle line:84%
that coon change
our consciousness.

00:57:51.936 --> 00:57:56.040 align:middle line:84%
That is how we wake up and
it's how we draw something new

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.441 align:middle line:90%
out of the Noah script,

00:57:57.441 --> 00:58:00.945 align:middle line:84%
how we let the Noetic
evolution take place.

00:58:00.945 --> 00:58:03.948 align:middle line:84%
Cultural and consciousness
evolution will take place

00:58:03.948 --> 00:58:08.252 align:middle line:84%
by us very intensively
becoming the nerve endings

00:58:08.252 --> 00:58:11.989 align:middle line:84%
in the global bring that
draw the lightning strikes

00:58:11.989 --> 00:58:15.159 align:middle line:84%
of that strange attractor of
a higher order that's wanting

00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:16.560 align:middle line:90%
to find its way into form.

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.861 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Allow ourselves to be

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:20.297 align:middle line:84%
that antenna whether it's
comfortable or uncomfortable

00:58:20.297 --> 00:58:23.534 align:middle line:84%
and then start digging
for its truth.

00:58:23.534 --> 00:58:26.904 align:middle line:84%
>> TP: And it will be both
ecstatic and uncomfortable --

00:58:26.904 --> 00:58:27.571 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:28.272 align:middle line:90%
>> TP: -- for sure.

00:58:28.272 --> 00:58:30.274 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, well put.

00:58:30.274 --> 00:58:32.076 align:middle line:90%
