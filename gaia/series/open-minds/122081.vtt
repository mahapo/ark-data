&gt;&gt;REGINA MEREDITH:
Feeling misunderstood

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.365 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:56%
is painful for anyone.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.909 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
This is magnified many
times over for those

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
in society who have
always felt misunderstood,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.748 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
who have gone astray,
and ended up in prison.

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
One misspoken word
can lean to violence

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:45.128 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and a life filled with
unspeakable levels of stress.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.215 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But what if someone who cares
and is skilled in listening

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
can make societies inmates
feel valued and heard?

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
What could happen
to their lives?

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Doug Noll is an
attorney and mediator

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
who was inspired by the plea
of an incarcerated woman

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to teach inmates
new skills to reduce

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.229 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
the horrors of prison violence.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He's with us today to speak of
this program Prison of Peace.

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:07.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm so happy to have you here.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I know some people
said, why are you

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.405 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
doing a show on
prisons, and prisoners,

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:12.155 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
and the incarcerated?

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.409 align:middle line:79% position:33% size:70%
The reality is people who've
been able to pull themselves

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.371 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
up amidst some of the most
challenging situations that

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
exist on earth,
those are my heroes.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:23.959 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
They are my heroes.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And someone like you
who is facilitating

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:32.009 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
this, where it didn't exist
at all is another of mine.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.093 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
You're another my heroes.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; DOUG NOLL: Thank you.

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.804 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: I really
appreciate what

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:37.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you're doing, because
you're doing the tough work.

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.182 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So I want to talk first
about your own start.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Can I read a quote
from Bernie Sanders?

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.185 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Oh, sure.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:42.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yeah, I know
you know the quote.

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:44.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
And I love it.

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
So I want to read this first.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
"We must end the
over incarceration

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:51.028 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of non-violent young
Americans who do not pose

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:53.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
serious threat in our society.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.198 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It's an international
embarrassment

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.742 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that we have more
people locked up

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:59.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in jail than any other
country on Earth,

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:02.539 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
more than even the communist
totalitarian state of China."

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And that puts in the
proper perspective.

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:08.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What we're doing in the
prison system is a disgrace.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, it is.

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:15.802 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
But more importantly,
if we release inmates,

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.346 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:61%
we need to support them.

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:20.015 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
And more importantly, we
need to invest in children,

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.434 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
because those inmates are
in there for a reason.

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:25.771 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And when you listen to their
stories and the tragedies

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:29.149 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and the horrors they have been
subjected to that puts them

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.776 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in prison the first
place, we begin

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:34.029 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to recognize that our whole
social network is corrupt,

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and that we have prisons
because we are not

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
willing to invest in children.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And fundamentally, we have
to invest in our children.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.412 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.039 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Now let's get to your
story before we start

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.916 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
moving into the larger story.

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:46.917 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
You're an attorney.

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.335 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: I am an attorney.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: And let's talk
about your background

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:52.631 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and what happened in your
life that catapulted you

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.509 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
down this road that you
probably never ever would

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.551 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
have guessed you'd be in.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.095 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: This is true.

00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:01.848 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So very briefly, I grew
up in Southern California.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I went to Dartmouth College.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I came back to California.

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:06.603 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
I went to law school.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I graduated with honors
and was on the law review.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.859 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I ended up clerking for a judge
for a year, which is what you

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
did back in the early 1970s.

00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:20.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And then went to a
law firm, where they

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.993 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
grew me to be a trial lawyer.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:25.622 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And I joined that firm in
1978, in September of 1978,

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.874 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
tried my first jury trial
in November of 1978.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.584 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: I've
always wondered, that

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
has to be the most frightening
thing, the first jury trial.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: It was a
little nerve wracking,

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
but it was exciting too.

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:39.052 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And so I embarked
on a 22-year career

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
as trial lawyer, a big
time-- civil trial,

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:45.809 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
where I did not do any criminal
work at all and handling

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
very large amounts of money,
very sophisticated problems.

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:52.566 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And along the way, I
pick up the martial arts.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:55.444 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And by the time I was 40, I
had earned my second degree

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:56.695 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
black belt.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:59.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And a couple weeks
after, my teacher

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.199 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
awarded me the second degree.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.994 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He called me into his office,
and he said, you're done.

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
You're too aggressive.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
You're too mean.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.416 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
To you, a fair fight is
five guys with knives

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
and you unarmed.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
You're a trial lawyer.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:12.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You're going to hurt yourself.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:13.962 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You're going to
hurt somebody else.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.548 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So I'm not teaching
you anymore until you

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:20.385 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
go master tai chi, which I
didn't understand at the time

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.763 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
was a death sentence, because
you never mastered tai chi.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.057 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And tai chi is the oldest
of all martial arts.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And all martial arts
come from tai chi.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.896 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And tai chi, actually, in and
of itself is quite violent.

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:33.857 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But there are two paradoxes
that changed my life.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:38.778 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The first paradox is the softer
you are, the stronger you are.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And the second paradox
is the more vulnerable,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the more powerful you are.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yes.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.371 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: So soft to be strong,
vulnerable to be powerful

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
did not compute.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.957 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I'm sure it didn't
to a man like you.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: However, I practiced
and studied under masters.

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:57.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And one day, about
five years later,

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.634 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I was trying a case
and cross examining

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:03.929 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
somebody in my own
inimitable aggressive style.

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And the thought came to me, what
the hell am I doing in here?

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.894 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And so at the end of that
trial, I had a vacation plan

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.396 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and spent 10 days white
water rafting with friends.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.024 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I spent the week powering
through these big rapids

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:18.652 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
up in Central Idaho
in my raft, all

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:21.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
by myself, thinking about
my career as a trial lawyer.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.156 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And I am I came
to the conclusion

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that this is not my calling.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So when I got back
to town, I live up

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in the mountains halfway between
Yosemite and Kings Canyon

00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:31.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
National Park.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So my practice is based out of
Fresno, California and Central

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.043 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
California.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I came down and I
heard the one and only

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.589 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
public service announcement
for a new master's degree

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.716 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in Peacemaking and
Conflict Studies.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.135 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I went, oh, that sounds
kind of interesting.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And it was being offered
at Fresno Pacific

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:49.057 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
University, which is the West
Coast Mennonite University.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And the Mennonites
are one of the three

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
traditional Protestant
peace churches.

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:55.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
So I ended up enrolling.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I was the first
lawyer in the program.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:02.571 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And I obtained my master's
degree, and it changed my life.

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.573 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Because as I went
through that program

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:07.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and began to learn
about human conflict

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and recognize what the
limitations of the law were,

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I began to see things in a
completely different way.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.126 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And so that led to huge
conflicts in the law form,

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
of course.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:21.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And ultimately, I left the law
firm in 2000, with no planning

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:27.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and opened up my own peacemaking
practice in November, 2000.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.222 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Who are your clients?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, at
that time, and still

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
today my clients are varied.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
They can be people
who are involved

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:38.106 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in litigating disputes, where
they need a mediator to help

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.774 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
negotiate a settlement.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:43.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Or I developed-- especially,
in the large family business

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.405 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
conflicts, I work with some
of the largest families

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in California, where they
have internal business

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.495 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and personal conflicts,
intra-organizational conflicts,

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
typically on the board of
directors or between partners.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:58.543 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So any kind of human conflict
where there's complexity,

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:01.588 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
there is deep anger
and frustration,

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.381 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and people needed
to solve problems

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.258 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that they can't solve
themselves, but usually

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
because of the emotionality.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:10.472 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Those are the kinds of
people who tend to call on me

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and engage me to help them
work through the process.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: So that's more
or less your day job?

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:15.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That's my day job.

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:17.646 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
That's what pays the bills.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Well, paid the bills, because
once I got into the Prison

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.859 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Project, you know, a lot of
that went by the wayside,

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because it really became
a full-time project,

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
even though it's pro bono.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:31.951 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Laurel and I sacrificed
a lot to do work.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
For all the decade
of 2000, I just

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
had some amazing experiences.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.542 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I was able to do leadership
work with Mobius Executive

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.961 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Leadership, which took me
all the world teaching people

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.464 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
dynamic transformed
leadership using the skills

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.341 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that I learned in
problem solving.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.176 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I got very interested
in neuroscience

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and was tutored by a
professor at Caltech.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Now that's
going to play a key.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Well, I'm going to ask you
some questions about that.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Yes.

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.017 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And I'm, in fact,
as far as I know,

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I'm the first
person to ever write

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.604 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
about neuroscience and
conflict in my first book

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.064 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
back into 2002.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And then, of course, it
became neuro everything.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.153 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And so I really
became interested

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:11.199 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in what causes conflict
between human beings

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.284 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and what are the best
interventions that we

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:18.123 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
can utilize to help people when
they are so mad they'd rather

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.792 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
shoot each other with AK47s
than sit down at the table

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.627 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and try to work out
their differences.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:25.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so I became a real
student of conflict and peace.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.842 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And so that's,
basically, what I've been

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
doing the last 15 or 20 years.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.641 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: So before we get
into the project and the people

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:40.311 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
involved in project, let's
talk about the neurosciences.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
There are all different kinds.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
There's radical truth.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.649 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
There's non-violent
communication.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There are all of these different
ways that people propagate

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:51.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the notion of having
peaceful resolution,

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.408 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
but what you have
found is really

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
something quite different.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Right.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:58.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I am interested in what works.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.123 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I'm not interested
in what doesn't work.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.083 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And what I've
learned is that a lot

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.628 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of people who do the
work that I do and also

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
a lot of people who
are on the periphery--

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.049 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
they're peace builders, or
they're spiritual people,

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:13.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
or they're religious people--
tend to do a lot of exhorting.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Oh, we should be peaceful.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Oh, we should listen better.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You need to listen better
to get rid of your conflict.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:23.062 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But they never teach people
actually have to do it.

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:27.650 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And so I became very interested
in how do we really teach this,

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.319 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and then how do we
really practice this?

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.197 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And I came across
a series of-- and I

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:33.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
began to look at literature.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:37.202 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What does the science tell
us about how the human brain

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.953 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
processes human conflict?

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And I learned a
tremendous amount.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.209 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Probably the most-- there
are many influential studies,

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:47.003 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but probably the most
influential was one in 2007

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
by UCLA Neuroscientist
Matthew Lieberman, who

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:53.051 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
wrote the book "Social,"
which became a bestseller

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
a couple of years ago.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:10:00.767 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But this study had to do with
how we can actually de-escalate

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
strong emotions in the
emotional centers of the brain

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
by helping people
label their emotions.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And he called the
technique affect labeling.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And without going into all
the science, essentially, what

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:16.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
happens is that emotions arise
in certain parts of the brain.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They're in the
center of the brain.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We've got a process them through
our language centers, which

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:23.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
are two areas on the outside
of the brain called Wernicke's

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:24.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
area and Broca's area.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:25.583 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
All that's going
to be coordinated

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
through the prefrontal cortex.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.753 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
Very complex.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:33.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And we are not born innately
with strong neuronal

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:35.093 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
connections between
the emotional centers

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:38.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of the brain or language centers
and the prefrontal cortex.

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
We have to learn this stuff.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:44.811 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And it turns out that we learn
rudimentary communication.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We learn language
skills, but we never

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:50.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
learned how to pay attention
to other people's emotions.

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.569 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
And that is the secret.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:57.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So what based on a Lieberman's
work, and a lot of study,

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:59.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and a lot of our own research,
and a lot of our own training,

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.495 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and teaching, and
observations, we

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:06.958 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
have learned that the
foundational skill

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.501 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
is very simple.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
When you are trying to
de-escalate somebody,

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.505 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in other words, you're facing
somebody who's very angry,

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.215 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and they're screaming
and yelling at you,

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.885 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and they may be
starting to get violent,

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.428 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
you go the violent
route-- which I've

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:21.389 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
done with the
martial arts-- or you

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:22.891 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
could do something different.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:25.727 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And what you do different
is you ignore the words.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It doesn't matter what
people are saying.

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:29.814 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: You try to just
connect with the feeling that

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.482 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
is being projected.

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:33.568 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
All you do is pay attention
to what their emotions are,

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and you guess at their emotions.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.698 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And the second thing you
do is you simply state back

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
their emotional experience
in a very simple declarative

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:42.368 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
sentence.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
You're angry.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
You're frustrated.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
You feel disrespected.

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:48.999 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
You don't feel listened to.

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.002 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Notice that I'm not
using an I statement.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:54.088 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So I'm not saying what
I hear you saying is X.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:58.009 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I'm not asking a
question, oh, are you angry?

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:01.137 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
All I'm doing is simply
guessing at the emotions.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:04.182 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
And the other thing that happens
is that we have emotions always

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.266 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
come in layers.

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And they're five basic layers.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.603 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And so we start
at the top layer.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And we just keep working
through the layers

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.651 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
until we get a very precise
physiological unconscious

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.277 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
reaction from the person.

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.863 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So I'm going to see
a nod of a head.

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:23.534 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I'm going to see a nod of the
head, a yellow verbal response,

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:25.453 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
yeah, that's right.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:31.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I'm going to see an exhale and
a relaxation of the shoulders,

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:32.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
all unconscious.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Interesting.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:35.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And when I
see-- when I teach--

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.966 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and when we see that
unconscious reaction,

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:39.884 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
which usually takes
about 30 seconds--

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:40.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: That's it.

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:42.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That's it.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.263 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It takes longer to
argue with somebody

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.557 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
than it does to
de-escalate them.

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And people don't believe this,
until they start doing it.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.063 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And even then they
can't believe it.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:53.773 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They said, oh, no
that couldn't be.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:58.152 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And I have thousands of stories
of people in prison and out,

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:01.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because I teach this all
over the world, where

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
people try this.

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:03.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And they can't believe it.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:04.909 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Is it really going to work?

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.411 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And then it works,
and they're astounded.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But yes, it takes 30 to
45 seconds to de-escalate.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:11.457 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It doesn't matter how angry the
person is, 30 to 45 seconds.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.793 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And you watch for this
physiological response,

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:14.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
and then you stop.

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
And you're done.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.256 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now when I'm working as
a mediator in a conflict,

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.008 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
especially highly
escalated conflict,

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I might use this skill 100 times
in a mediation and a mediation

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.139 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
day in an eight
or nine hour day.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.766 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
So people, they escalate.

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:30.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
They get angry and frustrated.

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:32.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They become emotional, and
then I de-escalate them.

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:34.564 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We do some more problem
solving, and then they

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
get escalated again.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.733 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
And I de-escalate them.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:37.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
We have problem solving.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.693 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
So it's not just something.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.028 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
It's not a one time deal.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's something that
you do consistently.

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:45.074 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
What we have found
in teaching parents

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:46.951 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in dealing with
children when they do

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
this is that they're
teaching their kids how

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to be emotionally intelligent.

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:54.292 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They're actually
reprogramming the human brain

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:57.378 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and making the connection
between emotions-- which

00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:59.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is what happens in the
brain-- to feelings, which

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:02.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is sort of the physiological
physical feelings

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:05.011 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that we have to the
words of emotion,

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the categories of emotions
that we create with language

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and associating all that
in the prefrontal cortex

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
to create meaning.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.478 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And what we do when we
affect label is literally

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:18.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
rewire the brain to allow people
to make those connections.

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:20.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: But first, there
has to be a mature person

00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:22.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
on one side of it.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: I wouldn't say mature.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:25.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I would say some skilled person.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: A skilled
person, if the mature.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: There you go,
and that's the secret.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.869 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Because I'm
thinking about this even

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in family situations, in spousal
situations, which is were

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:33.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
conflict is so common.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That's right.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Someone has to
keep their head about them.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And that is that
is what I've learned

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.881 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
is the fundamental problem
is because the skill is not

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
innate, it must be taught.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.593 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You must have somebody who
has the skill, learning it.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And so my mission now-- it
started in the prisons--

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:51.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and now is teach this skill
to anybody who wants to learn.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And actually there's
online course

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.477 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that I put up that people
can-- if they want to go.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.436 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
It's puremagic.com.

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.854 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
They could learn how to--

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Puremagic.com,
so anyone can go there?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Anyone can go there.

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:01.526 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: There's no barrier.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
You don't have to whip
out your credit card?

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:05.446 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, you got
to pay some money. $50.

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.573 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: $50, but that's
the most important lesson

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.866 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
you're going to learn
in your lifetime.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:10.368 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, not
only that, but it's

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:14.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
just-- that's just a one--
I've had museums pay $50

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.915 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and teach how their
docents how to do this.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.125 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.835 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: So it's not
about the money.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.087 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: At $50, no,
it's not about the money.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.755 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
But--

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.382 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: In that, if you take
that, download the workbook,

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:26.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
find a trusted friend, spend
a Saturday afternoon going

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.302 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
through the eight
lessons, you're

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.137 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
going to learn how do that.

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:30.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Oh my god.

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:30.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
You could save families.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
You could save marriages.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And this is not even getting
into the really tough stuff.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:35.184 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That's right.

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:37.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The stories are unbelievable
that I get back.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:40.064 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
How people have used this
in so many different ways

00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:41.774 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in their families,
and their workplaces,

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:44.443 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and their relationships and
just say no wonder you call it,

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:46.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
it's pure magic.

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:49.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: You know, what I'm
finding interesting in society

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:53.911 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
at large-- and so prison
being the extreme of that--

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:59.167 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is that as life becomes more
stressful in Western culture--

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.377 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
well, now globally--
as like becomes more

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:05.715 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
stressful, as people are really
in more survival mode then

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
creative mode now,
it's as though they're

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.429 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
consciousness is imploding.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And you want to call it
self-centeredness, but it's

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
simply

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Survival.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Survival is a good word.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.896 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: --survival.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.189 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
You don't have any energy
to be aware of much

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
outside of this stuff.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.109 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: So here's a really cool
thing about this technique.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:26.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And your audience will
appreciate this more

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
on Gaiam TV.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.449 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
When you do this, you
experience oneness.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:33.492 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Absolutely.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Because
what happens is when

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.579 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
you are so focused on the
other person's emotions,

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:37.538 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
your ego dissolves.

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:38.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yes.

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:39.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: You become
one with them.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.001 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You become one with
your higher self.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.711 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And you experience
a transcendence

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:46.672 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
for about 15 or 20 seconds
that it's absolutely addictive.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.425 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And that's why this so
powerfully reinforcing.

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:51.886 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: I just love
what you're doing.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:55.473 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And to me, there's nothing
more important on this planet

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
with people who are by
as a result of survival

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
issues, the self-absorbed,
not being aware

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.815 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of other people's emotions,
hardly aware of their own.

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.859 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And being deluged
with stuff that's junk.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.153 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Stuff, stimuli, junk.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:10.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I mean, this is really
an important mission.

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:13.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So anyway, I just wanted
to get-- yeah, go ahead.

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: I was just going
to say-- so it's really--

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I mean, just to get
into the Prison Project,

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.122 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the way that started-- well, we
can talk about how it started.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.958 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But what really intrigued
me in that moment

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
when Laurel read Susan Russo's
letter to me-- which we get to

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in a moment-- is I
thought to myself here

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.548 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
is an opportunity to
really prove whether or not

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:30.967 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
this stuff works.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:33.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Because if I can go into
maximum security prisons

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:36.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and teach murderers how
to be effective listeners,

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
peacemakers,
mediators, than what's

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:39.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
wrong with the rest of us?

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And that's
what got me started.

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:44.063 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: That's
what intrigued me too

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is that you were able to do--
you've been able to do this.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So OK, so tell us who Laurel
is and set up Susan Russo.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then we're going to
go to video clip of Susan.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.116 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: So Laurel Kaufer is
one of the most amazing women

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.492 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
in the world.

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:58.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
She is a mediator like
myself and a lawyer.

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:00.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
She lives in
Southern California.

00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I don't have enough
time to talk about all

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of her attributes,
but she is one

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of these woman when
she sees a great need,

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.175 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
she does what she
can to fill the need.

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:15.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And as a result of
Hurricane Katrina,

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
she went on her own
dime to the Gulf Coast

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and ended up starting the myth
Mississippi Mediation Project

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.813 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and taught the
state of Mississippi

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:28.357 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
how to mediate their speeds
instead of how to use violence.

00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:31.235 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And to this day,
here's a Jewish woman

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:33.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
from Southern California
going to the Deep South,

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:36.365 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
teaching the communities
there, all the communities,

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the rural communities
and the larger cities,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
people how to mediate.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:41.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And I mean that's just Laurel.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And she's just this
amazing human being,

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:47.752 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who is incredibly tenacious
and has compassion.

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:49.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Obviously, great
empathy and compassion.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:51.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Oh, yes, and
a wonderful teacher.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:54.342 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And so we've had an
incredible collaboration.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:57.219 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So what happened was that
in August, August 10,

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.805 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I think, of 2009, I got
a phone call from her.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.307 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And I live up in
central California,

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and she's down in Los Angeles.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And I got a call from her.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.895 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And she said, hey, I
just got this letter,

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and I don't know whether
it's junk or not,

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:08.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
but let me read it to you.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:10.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And I said, well, who's it from?

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And she says, well,
it's from a woman

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
by the name of
Susan Russo, who's

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:18.366 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
serving a life sentence in a
women's prison in Chowchilla.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.034 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
She says, by the way,
where's Chowchilla?

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:22.536 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And I go, well, that's about
an hour and a half north of me.

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:24.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And she says, OK,
that's what I thought.

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:29.126 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So she read the letter to me,
and Susan is serving a life

00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:32.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
sentence, and she's now at the
Southern California Women's

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:34.507 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Facility, which is
also in Chowchilla.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And basically, she
was writing a letter

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.969 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on behalf of 50 women
who were serving

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
life sentences in this women's
maximum security women's

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
prison, who were
tired of the violence.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.685 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And they wanted somebody
to come in and teach them

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.187 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
mediation skills.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They barely knew the
difference between mediation

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.024 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
and meditation.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And as it turns out, they
had written 50 letters,

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.279 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and this was the 50th letter.

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And nobody had responded
to the letters.

00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:02.159 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So Laurel read me the letter
and said, what do you think?

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.787 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I thought about it
for about a nanosecond,

00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:06.247 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and I thought, if
this is legit, we

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:09.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
should do this,
because I thought,

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:12.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as I said before, if we can
teach these skills effectively

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to murderers and teach them
to be effective peacemakers,

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.384 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
then nobody can
gain, say, what I'm

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:20.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
talking about as a peacemaker.

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:21.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
So we did.

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:22.596 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
We followed up.

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:23.889 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
It took us about
six months going

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:26.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
through incredible
bureaucratic hurdles

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:29.353 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to finally get the permission
to start a pilot program,

00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and we started
training our first 17

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.232 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
women in March of 2010.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: So shall
we go to Susan Russo

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and let her tell her
part of the story?

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And let me
just say that we

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.405 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
were able to get in
with some filmmakers,

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and so the clips that
we're going to be seeing

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
are clips from about 40
hours of interviews we've

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
taken with the women in
the prison over the years.

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So we've been able to
capture a lot of this.

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:49.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.500 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So let's take a
look at Susan Russo

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.419 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and why she felt
compelled to do this.

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:54.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
[video playback]

00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:58.215 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
-I worked so long and
hard on this project,

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:01.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
because it was
something that meant--

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:02.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
it was very important to me.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:21.822 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
Being a lifer, it's
difficult. It's not easy.

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:30.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So this not only was
going to benefit me,

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:32.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but it was going to
benefit the community.

00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:33.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[end video playback]

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:34.835 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yes, that's
very compelling.

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I mean, most of us
can't fathom what

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:41.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it's like to fear for your own
well-being every single day,

00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:43.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
unless you're raised in a
family of violence, which is

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:45.346 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
where a lot of these came from.

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:49.099 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, first of all,
prisons are violent places.

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:52.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But what's even
more amazing to me

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:54.813 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
is how many women--
every single woman

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:56.524 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that we worked with
has been raped,

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
has been physically
abused, and most of them

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:01.195 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
had been drug addicted
to one degree or another.

00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:02.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Men, too, for that
matter, because we

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:05.658 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
work in both the men's
prison and women's prisons.

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:09.495 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And the horror of
their upbringing

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:13.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
is-- you couldn't write
something that horrific.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We were working with
one young woman,

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:17.586 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who told us the prison was
the safest place she's ever

00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:18.379 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
been in her life.

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:19.838 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:22.383 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And a lot of
these women feel that way

00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:25.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
because of what they
had to suffer from.

00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:26.845 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
And there's a reason.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.556 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I mean, I'm not condoning
anything that they've done,

00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
but there is a reason why.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
There's a reason
why people murder,

00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:38.065 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and people don't come out
of wombs as murderers.

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:40.693 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We breathe and program
murderers in our society.

00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:42.778 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
We create them.

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:45.281 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We allow families
to create them.

00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:47.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Our society allows
this to happen,

00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:50.911 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and that is why we
have this violence.

00:22:50.911 --> 00:22:52.871 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It's not because humans
are inherently violent.

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
They aren't.

00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:55.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We have the capacity
for violence,

00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but it's got to be something
that's programmed and taught,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.461 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and it's taught
over and over again

00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:03.549 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
from abuse and both physical,
emotional, and spiritual abuse

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:04.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
of people.

00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:07.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And that's why I
said that if we want

00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:09.013 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to really solve our
social problems,

00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:10.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we have to invest in children.

00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:12.391 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yes, and
I mean, that would

00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:15.811 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
have to be true, because
you're programming people

00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:18.272 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to have empathy, to
be able to listen,

00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:22.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to participate in peace, so if
you can be programmed one way,

00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:24.153 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
we can be all
programmed both ways.

00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:25.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Exactly.

00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:27.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And that's the good news
about the prison project

00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:28.949 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
is that the big
takeaway is that it

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:30.326 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
doesn't matter if you're set.

00:23:30.326 --> 00:23:32.995 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We have inmates who are
70 and 80 years old.

00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:34.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
We have people who
are gang bangers.

00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We have people who
are Aryan Brotherhood.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:42.171 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
I mean, incredible diversity of
ethnicity and religious beliefs

00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:43.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and all kinds of
different beliefs,

00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:47.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and we're able to take the
hardest of the hardcore, who

00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:48.969 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
are willing to change
and willing to listen

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:50.387 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and willing to
learn and practice,

00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and we can reprogram them.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.350 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They can reprogram
themselves with our training.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.976 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And that's what has happened.

00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And it has been one of the
most amazing transformative

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.065 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
experiences I have ever
witnessed as a human being.

00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:02.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Oh, I can't imagine.

00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:04.276 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And you almost have
to be there up close,

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:06.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
but we're going to see a
couple clips of people.

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:08.906 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Let me ask you something
and backtrack a little bit

00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:11.325 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
ago, because in this,
we're talking primarily

00:24:11.325 --> 00:24:13.535 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
about work in a women's
prison, but we're also

00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:17.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
going to extend out to
work in men's prisons.

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:18.832 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Just from the
neurochemical point

00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:21.251 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of view in terms
of future behavior,

00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:23.337 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the whole subject of
sexual abuse, and you

00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:25.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
said all these women
had been through it.

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:27.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
What does this do to
split their psyche?

00:24:27.925 --> 00:24:30.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, I'm not a
clinician, so I'm probably not

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.970 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
the best person
to speak to this,

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:36.517 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but we do know that, obviously,
when people are subjected

00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:40.312 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to extreme trauma, and we enter
into this condition called

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:43.023 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
post-traumatic stress
disorder, that one

00:24:43.023 --> 00:24:44.650 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of the many things
that happens is

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we get what's known as
a hyperactive amygdala.

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:50.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In the amygdala are two little
almond-shaped processes.

00:24:50.072 --> 00:24:52.157 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Think of them as
mini computers that

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:55.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
are in the center of the brain
on both sides of our heads.

00:24:55.244 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
That is the basis for
our fear reaction system.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.794 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And the job of the amygdala is
to process raw sensory data,

00:25:03.794 --> 00:25:07.381 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and judge it as either safe
or dangerous, good or bad.

00:25:07.381 --> 00:25:08.882 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
So it's binary.

00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:11.719 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And when people have been
subject to deep trauma,

00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:14.263 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the amygdala tends to
judge everything bad,

00:25:14.263 --> 00:25:17.057 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and it gets hyperactive
and immediately

00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:19.560 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
triggers the rest of the brain
and the rest of the body to--

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: It's like red alert.

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:21.061 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That's right.

00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
Exactly.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And so that's what we see.

00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:26.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And when that happens, the
prefrontal cortex shuts downs,

00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
so people can no longer think.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.611 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: So you
lose your ability

00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:31.238 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to basically be rational.

00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:32.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: To make choices.

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:33.198 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
That's right.

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You lose your rationality.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.868 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
You lose your ability
to make choices,

00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and you are on
programmed auto-pilot,

00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:40.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and if violence is what
your programming has been,

00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:43.292 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
then that's where
you're going to go.

00:25:43.292 --> 00:25:45.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And that's what
happens in a nutshell.

00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:48.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And the clinicians
and scientists

00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:51.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
would, of course, go into much
more in depth technical talk.

00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:53.093 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
But essentially,
it's programming.

00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:54.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: But no, that's good.

00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:55.721 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
That's helpful.

00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:59.391 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And we're programmed
from experience to be this way.

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:04.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And there is some
organic stuff that

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.899 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
happens where people's brains
aren't formed properly,

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:08.442 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
but mostly, it's programming.

00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:09.985 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Mostly, it's programming.

00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:13.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Let's talk about--
the program has begun.

00:26:13.197 --> 00:26:15.449 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
You've cleared
all the paperwork.

00:26:15.449 --> 00:26:18.452 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And you had to make
some strategic decisions

00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:20.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in the beginning,
and at first, when

00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I was watching the
video before I'd really

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
done much research into
it, I was wondering, now

00:26:23.832 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
why did you choose people
who were long term or life

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
sentences?

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:33.550 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Laurel and I have always
been of the opinion as trainers

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that doing one-off trainings
are a waste of time.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.931 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And there are a
lot of people who

00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:40.390 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
promise to conflict resolution.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I'll come into your
organization and teach you

00:26:42.142 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
conflict resolution in a week,
and your life will be good.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.689 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Well, that's just not true.

00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:51.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
If you want to really have
impact in an organization

00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:54.696 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and have change, it
takes 18 to 24 months.

00:26:54.696 --> 00:26:57.324 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And then you need
sustainability beyond that.

00:26:57.324 --> 00:27:00.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So we decided to design this
program around training lifers

00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:02.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and very long
termers, who are going

00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:05.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to be in the prison for a
long time, who are motivated

00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.543 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
for a peaceful
environment to teach them

00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:11.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
how to be peacemakers,
mediators, and trainers,

00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:13.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
so they could teach
and coach and mentor

00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:16.343 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
all the inmates, who were short
termers coming in and out.

00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:20.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And our goal was to
teach inmates to teach

00:27:20.097 --> 00:27:22.182 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
other inmates how to do this.

00:27:22.182 --> 00:27:26.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So we decided to work
with lifer population,

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:29.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
because our investment
of time in them

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:31.733 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
would be reflected
back many times over,

00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:34.778 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
because they would be there
to help and teach and train

00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:37.656 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and mentor other inmates, who
were not going to be serving

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:38.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
long life sentences.

00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.244 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: So strategically,
yeah, it makes sense then.

00:27:42.244 --> 00:27:45.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And what was in it for
them is it says here,

00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:50.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
your strapline is from serving
life to a life of service.

00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:53.255 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And this is really the crux
of what these women are

00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:55.632 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
drawn to is, I'm here for life.

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:57.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Does it have to
be this miserable?

00:27:57.593 --> 00:27:59.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Right.

00:27:59.136 --> 00:28:02.514 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So part of what our project
is, we tell people this

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:03.932 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
is not a self-help program.

00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:05.934 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This is a program about
service to humanity.

00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:07.936 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
If you want to learn
how to serve humanity,

00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:09.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
you're in the right place.

00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:12.649 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
If you want to just
get another chrono

00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:15.402 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and another nice little
gold star in your file,

00:28:15.402 --> 00:28:17.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
this is not for you.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
This is hard work.

00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:23.327 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And what we have done is
created a program and a pathway

00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:27.122 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
for inmates to start serving
other inmates as peacemakers,

00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:30.125 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
mediators, and teachers,
trainers, mentors, and coaches.

00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:33.211 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So that gives them, for the
first time in their lives,

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:35.464 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
many of them, great
and deep meaning,

00:28:35.464 --> 00:28:38.926 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
because they see the results.

00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:41.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They hear the stories of
people they've trained,

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:42.930 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and they've heard
about marriages

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.475 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that have been reconciled and
relationships with children

00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:48.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that have been
completely recreated

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:50.896 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in completely different ways
and people who've gotten out

00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:53.815 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and have written back saying
how their lives have completely

00:28:53.815 --> 00:28:54.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
changed because of this.

00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:56.652 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
And so that gives them meaning.

00:28:56.652 --> 00:28:59.696 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And when we have
meaning in life,

00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:01.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
we can tolerate
just about anything.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.076 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And so that's why
we say what we do

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:06.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
is take people who are
serving life sentences

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:10.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and teach them how to
live lives of service.

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:12.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Can you talk
a little bit about,

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:15.003 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
from the various men
and women you've met,

00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:19.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
who are in for life, the
psychology of that situation

00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:21.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that the rest of us
can't really fathom.

00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:24.054 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Talking about
some of the stories?

00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:26.223 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Well, kind of
their deep psychology

00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:28.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of knowing they're never
going to be released.

00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Most of
them, by the time

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:34.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
we get to them, most of
them have accepted the fact.

00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:35.232 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: This is their life.

00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:36.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Right.

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:39.444 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Now they are constantly
working on getting

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:40.988 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
letters of commutation.

00:29:40.988 --> 00:29:43.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They're filing lawsuits,
petitions for habeas corpus.

00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:44.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: So there's
still some hope for most

00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.535 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of the people in their minds.

00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:48.453 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Many of them,
they're doing this,

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but the reality is
that there is no hope.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.457 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
I mean, it's very unlikely
that many of these

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:53.875 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
are going to get--
although I have

00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:56.086 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
to say that of the 17
women that we started

00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:57.754 align:middle line:15% position:44% size:78%
with, eight have been released.

00:29:57.754 --> 00:29:59.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Interesting.

00:29:59.423 --> 00:30:01.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And a lot of that is
because of Prison of Peace,

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:03.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because the parole board has
seen the dramatic changes

00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:07.180 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as a result of Prison of
Peace, so that's been exciting.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:10.684 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And as a result, we are
finally waking up to the idea

00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:12.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that the mass
incarceration movement has

00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:16.940 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
been a complete and utter
social and financial failure,

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.942 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that more and more
people are getting out.

00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So there is more hope today
than there was in the past,

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.948 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
but mostly, they have
to live with the fact

00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:26.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that many of them,
that if you're

00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:29.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
living a sentence of life
without possibility of parole,

00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:30.495 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that you are in for life.

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:31.371 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And this is where
you're going to live,

00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:32.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and it's your community.

00:30:32.581 --> 00:30:35.333 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And they seem to
have, most of them,

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:36.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
like any other
human beings, they

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:38.003 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
have up days and down days.

00:30:38.003 --> 00:30:39.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But they seem to
have adapted to it

00:30:39.254 --> 00:30:42.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as well as anybody can expect.

00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:44.092 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Let's talk
about-- you brought this

00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:47.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to a woman's facility, because
Susan Russo wrote to you.

00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:51.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But once you started dealing
with both men's and women's

00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:54.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
facilities, was it
easier to introduce this

00:30:54.603 --> 00:30:56.897 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
into women's facilities
than men's or not?

00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:58.565 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, we
started with the women,

00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:01.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and then as a result of prison
realignment in California,

00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:05.822 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the original prison we started
in, which was a woman's prison,

00:31:05.822 --> 00:31:08.241 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
was repurposed into
a men's prison.

00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:12.079 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And we had never intended
to expand this project

00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:14.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
beyond one prison.

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
But when--

00:31:15.957 --> 00:31:17.125 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: It was just
kind of an experiment

00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:17.918 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to validate that
this stuff works.

00:31:17.918 --> 00:31:19.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Right.

00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:20.796 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: And then
you saw the need.

00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:23.799 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, what happened
was that as a result of AB

00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:26.051 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
109 and California
prison realignment,

00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:27.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
all the women were shipped
out of that prison.

00:31:27.969 --> 00:31:30.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They were moved into two other
women's prisons, so our women

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:31.681 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
were basically split.

00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:33.391 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
By then, we had over
100 women trained,

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:35.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and we said we would follow
them to either CIW in Southern

00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:38.772 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
California or the Central
California Women's

00:31:38.772 --> 00:31:40.816 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Facility across the street.

00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:44.986 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
At the same time, the staff
at the old prison that

00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:47.948 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
was becoming a men's prison saw
how powerful this program was,

00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:50.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and they started calling
us and nagging us.

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:53.620 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When are you bringing Prison
of Peace to the men's prison?

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.788 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
We really need it here.

00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:56.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
We really want you
guys to do this.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now you have to understand, this
is a totally pro Bono project.

00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:01.545 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
We don't get paid for this.

00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:03.338 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
There are no funders out there.

00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:06.424 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We have a file drawer
full of rejection letters

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:08.176 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
from foundations.

00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:11.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Nobody wants to fund any kind
of work with lifers of any kind,

00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:14.808 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and we have found
that we have had

00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:18.770 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to fund this ourselves at the
cost of about $50,000 a year

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.149 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
out of pocket, plus our own
professional time, which

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.316 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
varies from year to year.

00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:25.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But it's basically
about $150,000

00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:28.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
each of our professional time.

00:32:28.155 --> 00:32:31.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And the idea of going into
yet a third prison just

00:32:31.908 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
didn't appeal to us.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
But it was a men's prison.

00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:36.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So we talked and
talked and talked,

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:39.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and finally, we both
decided, OK, let's try it.

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:46.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So we started with a men's
prison in October of 2012,

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:49.342 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and we found that the
men were much easier

00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:50.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
to train than the women.

00:32:50.427 --> 00:32:51.595 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:32:51.595 --> 00:32:53.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Now there's a shocker.

00:32:53.597 --> 00:32:56.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
What is it about that dynamic?

00:32:56.016 --> 00:33:04.149 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: The men--
how do I describe it?

00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
They just--

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: You don't have
to be politically correct.

00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:07.277 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Just share.

00:33:07.277 --> 00:33:08.695 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: I know.

00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:12.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The women, because they
had been so traumatized,

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.826 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
were extremely emotional.

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:17.412 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And so when we want
walked in, we never

00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:21.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
know what we were getting from
day to day with the women.

00:33:21.374 --> 00:33:25.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There are days when our
students would be ready to learn

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:26.963 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and really happy,
and there would

00:33:26.963 --> 00:33:29.966 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
be days when they were just
incredibly depressed or angry

00:33:29.966 --> 00:33:31.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
or frustrated or whatever.

00:33:31.426 --> 00:33:34.846 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And then as we
worked with them, we

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:37.849 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
learned how difficult
this work is,

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:40.310 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
because it causes you
to have to look at who

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.978 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
you are as a human being.

00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:43.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And many of these women have
been shut down emotionally,

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.273 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
for that was their
survival mechanism.

00:33:45.273 --> 00:33:47.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
So it was difficult.

00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.903 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: So you had a very
complex array of emotions

00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:51.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to deal with with the women.

00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:51.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Correct.

00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
That was on the service.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.242 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Well, and
also, with women,

00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:57.244 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the notion of being
involved with violence,

00:33:57.244 --> 00:33:59.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you're almost always on
the receiving end, not the

00:33:59.329 --> 00:34:00.538 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
giving end of it.

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.832 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And so there are
such massive levels

00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:04.918 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of fear in the body and the--

00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:08.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Not only that, but
then the defense mechanisms is

00:34:08.338 --> 00:34:10.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to put on this hard,
concrete exterior

00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:12.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
we had to break through.

00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:14.552 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The men are much more
hierarchical in prison,

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:17.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and they're much more
organized, socially organized.

00:34:17.681 --> 00:34:24.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And these men came in
skeptical, but ready to learn.

00:34:24.479 --> 00:34:26.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Certainly, they were
emotional, but we

00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:28.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
weren't dealing with the
kinds of emotional outbursts

00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:29.776 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that we would get
with the women.

00:34:29.776 --> 00:34:31.319 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They tended to
constrain, although I

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:33.863 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
will say that the men
cried, and they cried a lot.

00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:36.324 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: To feel heard--
everyone cries when you

00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:37.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
feel heard for the first time.

00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:39.077 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That's exactly right.

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:40.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And the second time.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.954 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: And the third time.

00:34:40.954 --> 00:34:42.497 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: You're right.

00:34:42.497 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Because no one
really feels heard in life.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Never, anywhere in life.

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:46.251 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: That's right.

00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:47.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: So we found
the men, and so when

00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:50.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
we would tell the men to
show up, they showed up.

00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:52.507 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When we said it's time to go
to work, they would go to work.

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:55.218 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
When we said do
this, they did it.

00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:57.595 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And we got very little
kickback, and with women, it

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:59.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
was like herding cats.

00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:01.057 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So we were quite
surprised, because we

00:35:01.057 --> 00:35:04.644 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
thought the men would
be a lot more hardcore.

00:35:04.644 --> 00:35:06.896 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And although we had many
men who are hardcore gang

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:14.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
bangers and really tough people,
they were pussycats with us.

00:35:14.738 --> 00:35:18.366 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And they were so
appreciative of us coming in.

00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:20.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And they realized week
after week after week,

00:35:20.243 --> 00:35:22.454 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we would come in and continue
teaching them training,

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:28.084 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
because this is not an easy
process we take them for.

00:35:28.084 --> 00:35:29.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Just to get to
the first level is

00:35:29.669 --> 00:35:32.172 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
84 hours of classroom training,
and probably double that

00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:34.174 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of practice time and
homework, written homework,

00:35:34.174 --> 00:35:35.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and reading that
we have them do.

00:35:35.592 --> 00:35:38.219 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It's very rigorous what
we take them through.

00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:40.972 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
And so we found the men to be--

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:42.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Easier than the women.

00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:43.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Easier than the women.

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.310 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And we ultimately, a
year ago, certified

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
our first male mediator,
who is 75 years old,

00:35:48.688 --> 00:35:51.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
been in prison all his
life, over 40 years.

00:35:51.733 --> 00:35:54.069 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And he's-- along
with other ones--

00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:56.863 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
he's just an amazing guy,
who's completely transformed

00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:57.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
as a result of this.

00:35:57.947 --> 00:35:59.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: I love it.

00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:00.533 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I mean, it must have
been such a joy for you

00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:02.410 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to see how that man
came along, even

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.287 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in the later years of
his life, to still want

00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:05.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to invest in this process.

00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:07.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And what
was really funny

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.170 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
about him was how resistant
he was in the beginning.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.299 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Just couldn't-- and we see
this time and time again is

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:18.551 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
there's something about our
project that calls certain

00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:19.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
inmates.

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:20.595 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
And they come in.

00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:21.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
They don't know
why they're there.

00:36:21.638 --> 00:36:23.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
They don't want to be there.

00:36:23.056 --> 00:36:24.432 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They hate the idea of
becoming peacemakers,

00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:27.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and yet they cannot stay away.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.479 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And they keep coming back and
coming back and coming back,

00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:31.981 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and they keep telling us,
they said, I hate this.

00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:33.650 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I hate what you guys
are going to me.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.527 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: But there's some
truth speaking from your side.

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: But they can't
stay away either.

00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:39.239 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:42.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So now let's talk about a really
big issue amongst all of this.

00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:45.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's really at the
core of all of this.

00:36:45.245 --> 00:36:48.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I did some research,
obviously, and one thing

00:36:48.832 --> 00:36:50.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that kept coming
up again and again

00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:52.961 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
is that prisons are
being used almost

00:36:52.961 --> 00:36:56.339 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as some kind of holding place
for people who really should be

00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:58.425 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
in other kinds of facilities.

00:36:58.425 --> 00:37:02.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I was running this
by a friend of mine,

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:05.807 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
who is a California death
row appeals attorney,

00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and we were talking about
prison reform in general.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And he said, it's just a shame
that people that are in prison

00:37:11.604 --> 00:37:14.232 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
aren't necessarily the ones
that should be in prison.

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.359 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They should be in other
kinds of facilities,

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:19.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and I said, oh, yeah,
particularly like-- what

00:37:19.028 --> 00:37:21.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
about white collar-- I
brought this up naively.

00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:24.492 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I mean, yeah, like white
color criminals, for example.

00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:26.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And he said, oh, no.

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:27.871 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Those are the sociopaths.

00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:30.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The ones that do high
level white collar crime--

00:37:30.874 --> 00:37:33.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
those are the true
sociopaths of society.

00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:35.086 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I completely disagree with you.

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:38.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Those are the guys that ruined
so many lives and don't care.

00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:40.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
They should be on death row.

00:37:40.175 --> 00:37:41.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And I was shocked
when he said that.

00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:43.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: I agree with that.

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:43.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: But I
thought, you're right.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.722 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
These are sociopaths.

00:37:45.722 --> 00:37:47.932 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Other people get caught up due
to circumstance and awful stuff

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.225 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and can end up in prison.

00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:52.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
These guys execute
it with intent.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And many of them
suffer from what I call

00:37:56.483 --> 00:37:58.443 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
overt maladaptive narcissism.

00:37:58.443 --> 00:38:04.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And it's the inability
to be empathic

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:06.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and the inability to have good
boundaries around what's right

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:07.952 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
and what's wrong.

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.705 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And they're dangerous people.

00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:11.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
They're not violent.

00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:12.916 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
They're just dangerous.

00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:13.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: They're
dangerous, and they ruin

00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:15.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a lot of lives in their way.

00:38:15.251 --> 00:38:17.462 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And so I wanted
to bring that up,

00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:19.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because that's one type
of person who you wouldn't

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:21.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
think should be there, but--

00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:26.596 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: To your point, if you
look at the statistics that

00:38:26.596 --> 00:38:28.097 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
are out there on
the internet, you

00:38:28.097 --> 00:38:31.643 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
will find that the Kennedy
administration started

00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:33.603 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the decline of mental
institutions, committee

00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:35.730 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and state-wide mental
institutions for good reason.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.775 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Because if you remember the
old movie, the Jack Nicholson

00:38:38.775 --> 00:38:41.194 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
movie, "One Flew over
the Cuckoo's Nest,"

00:38:41.194 --> 00:38:44.113 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which really exemplified the
horrors of mental institutions.

00:38:44.113 --> 00:38:45.615 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: They were
run very poorly.

00:38:45.615 --> 00:38:47.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Exactly.

00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:51.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And so there was good reason why
many of these state hospitals

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
should be shut down.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.582 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
On the other hand, they were
never replaced with anything.

00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:57.460 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And when the mass incarceration
movement started in the 1980s

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.295 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
under the Reagan
administration, you

00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:01.881 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
can see a direct relationship
between the decline

00:39:01.881 --> 00:39:04.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in mental health beds
across the United States

00:39:04.634 --> 00:39:08.596 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and the increase in prison
construction and people

00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:10.098 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
incarcerated.

00:39:10.098 --> 00:39:13.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And today in Los Angeles
County, the LA County Jail

00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.812 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
is the largest mental
institution in the world.

00:39:15.812 --> 00:39:17.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It has one full
facility dedicated

00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:19.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to nothing but
mentally ill people,

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:21.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and I believe the population
is something between 8,000

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.652 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and 10,000 inmates.

00:39:22.652 --> 00:39:26.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And these are inmates
that are not getting--

00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:28.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and the sheriff will
tell you very bluntly,

00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:32.245 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we do not have the resources,
the money, or the expertise

00:39:32.245 --> 00:39:34.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
to treat these people.

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
To the extent that
we can keep them

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.627 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
on medication that helps them a
little bit, we try to do that,

00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:43.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but fundamentally, we are here
to incarcerate, not to treat.

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.883 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And we put all
these people here,

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:48.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because they have been
clinically diagnosed as having

00:39:48.094 --> 00:39:49.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
some sort of mental illness.

00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:52.181 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
8,000 people in
the LA County Jail.

00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:54.309 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And the state prison, the
California State Prison's

00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:56.352 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
the same way.

00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:59.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
There's just a huge--
I'm just going to guess.

00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:02.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I'm not an expert, but I
would guess it over 40% to 45%

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.361 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
of the people in
prison today have

00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:07.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
some degree of mental illness.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.115 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: And then
let's add drug abuse.

00:40:09.115 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Then we add another
40% for drug addiction.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: So we're
really looking

00:40:13.995 --> 00:40:17.790 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
at a low percentage of people
that are without empathy

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
or whatever that
one chief equality

00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:24.505 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is that you need to be
separated from society.

00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:27.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: There was a
certain population's group

00:40:27.383 --> 00:40:28.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
that is dangerous.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
They're dangerous to us.

00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:31.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
They're dangerous to themselves.

00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
They need to be
put away, put away

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:35.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in the sense they need
to be put in a place,

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:38.436 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
where they are not going
to be a danger to society.

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But that is a very
small minority

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of the people that
are in prison today.

00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:46.027 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Huge percentage
are in for drug abuse,

00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:49.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and for trafficking,
drug related crimes.

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:53.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And when I first started
becoming interested

00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:56.287 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in this story was
quite a number of years

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.373 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
ago when I was given a
document, that I probably

00:40:58.373 --> 00:41:01.751 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
shouldn't have had my hands on,
and I won't go into the detail.

00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:07.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But it delineated
the chain of command,

00:41:07.924 --> 00:41:11.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
so to speak, on bringing
drugs out of Vietnam

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.013 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
in a horrific manner.

00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:16.724 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The high up people, very
high profile people,

00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:18.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
we all know the names of
who were involved in it,

00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:22.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
sanctioned it, passed it
on, and then literally

00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:27.068 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
started not
inculcating, but started

00:41:27.068 --> 00:41:29.112 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
putting those drugs
into releasing them

00:41:29.112 --> 00:41:31.906 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
into the poor,
urban neighborhoods.

00:41:31.906 --> 00:41:34.283 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And now you end
up with something

00:41:34.283 --> 00:41:36.911 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that is now literally
about three,

00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:39.330 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
four decades later,
systemic to cultures.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And we're going
through a huge heroin epidemic

00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:42.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
right now.

00:41:42.875 --> 00:41:44.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: And now
we're going through,

00:41:44.419 --> 00:41:46.003 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
out of Afghanistan,
government-sanctioned-- well,

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:48.089 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Black Ops sanctioned,
whatever you want to call it,

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
having government subsidize
their own coffers by running

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.260 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
drugs into these areas.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.970 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But there's another
purpose for it.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.889 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There's something much more--
Michelle Alexander wrote

00:41:56.889 --> 00:41:58.766 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
about in her book,
"The New Jim Crow,"

00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:01.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and she wrote about
it very reluctantly.

00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:04.897 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It seems to be there's
also a very specific agenda

00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:08.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to incarcerate African Americans
starting from a young age,

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:11.362 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and whole generations
are missing.

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:14.615 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, I don't subscribe
to conspiracy theories,

00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:21.998 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but I do believe that there is
a confluence of different types

00:42:21.998 --> 00:42:26.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of policies and conflicts within
our government in our culture

00:42:26.419 --> 00:42:29.172 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that do lead to
mass incarceration.

00:42:29.172 --> 00:42:32.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And the reason that it
perpetuates itself--

00:42:32.759 --> 00:42:34.135 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;REGINA:
Disproportionately to--

00:42:34.135 --> 00:42:35.595 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Absolutely.

00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:36.888 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: People of
pigment across the board.

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:38.890 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Absolutely
correct, and clearly

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.850 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in a gross discriminatory
and racial manner.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.436 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Absolutely no
question about that.

00:42:43.436 --> 00:42:46.147 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And there's a confluence of
events that leads to that,

00:42:46.147 --> 00:42:49.108 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and the problem is that
to solve that problem

00:42:49.108 --> 00:42:54.155 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
will take a conscious political
and social effort that most

00:42:54.155 --> 00:42:56.949 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
people don't want to engage
in, because think about it.

00:42:56.949 --> 00:43:00.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Politicians get elected on fear.

00:43:00.453 --> 00:43:02.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And so when the
election cycle comes

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:04.582 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
around, if you're
running for the dog

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:07.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
catcher of the city of
Louisville, Colorado,

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:09.587 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you're going to put up, I'm
running for dog catcher.

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:12.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The Deputy Sheriff's
Association supports me.

00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:15.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I'm tough on crime, even
though being the dog catcher

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:19.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
has nothing to do with
anything on crime.

00:43:19.514 --> 00:43:21.015 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
And you see that.

00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:22.683 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And the other exercise
that's really interesting

00:43:22.683 --> 00:43:27.063 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is to take your local newspaper,
whether you get it online

00:43:27.063 --> 00:43:30.399 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
or not, and count the
number of headlines

00:43:30.399 --> 00:43:33.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that pertain to
crime, and divide that

00:43:33.152 --> 00:43:35.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
by the total number of
headlines in the first section

00:43:35.363 --> 00:43:37.073 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
of the paper.

00:43:37.073 --> 00:43:39.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And what you will find is that
the proportion is about 75%,

00:43:39.742 --> 00:43:41.661 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and there are reasons for that.

00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:46.123 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But the problem is that when
we as a culture get our news,

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:50.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we think that there are
mass shootings everywhere,

00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:51.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and there's mass
violence everywhere.

00:43:51.587 --> 00:43:53.130 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Well, the media's
propagating the notion

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that life is to be feared.

00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:55.925 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That's right.

00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:57.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And it's doing that because
young journalists are taught

00:43:57.927 --> 00:43:59.720 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that conflict is what
media is all about,

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and the other thing that
people don't realize

00:44:01.973 --> 00:44:04.851 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
is criminal activity
is publicly reported.

00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:07.979 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It's the cheapest
news to acquire.

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:12.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's very inexpensive to get
somebody to do the city beat

00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:14.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and report on crime.

00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:16.988 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's really cheap and easy,
and so that fills up the paper.

00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:18.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And it's scintillating
for people.

00:44:18.406 --> 00:44:21.284 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
So the problem is
that when we're

00:44:21.284 --> 00:44:24.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
fed with this digest
of and to digest all

00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:27.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of this apparent violence, and
then when you add in that game

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.417 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
violence and television
violence and movie

00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:32.003 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
violence and all of
this stuff, it adds up,

00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:35.089 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and it becomes very difficult
to change the inertia

00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:37.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
of incarcerating people.

00:44:37.592 --> 00:44:41.470 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
What people don't realize about
this mass incarceration problem

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:44.098 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
is the financial cost
to us as taxpayers.

00:44:44.098 --> 00:44:47.393 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In California, we spend $13
billion year on prisons--

00:44:47.393 --> 00:44:50.855 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
just prisons, not police, not
courts, not law enforcement,

00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:54.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
just the prison system--
and we spend $9 billion

00:44:54.984 --> 00:44:58.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a year on education, K
through graduate school.

00:44:58.362 --> 00:44:59.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: If we didn't
do in this hour,

00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:02.325 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
except highlight
that one statement,

00:45:02.325 --> 00:45:04.076 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
this is a very broken system.

00:45:04.076 --> 00:45:06.370 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And what I don't get is
why the conservatives are not

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:07.496 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
going crazy about this.

00:45:07.496 --> 00:45:08.664 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:10.249 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: You hear
the conservatives

00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:13.002 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
talking about their antipathy
towards big government.

00:45:13.002 --> 00:45:15.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There is nothing bigger and more
bureaucratic than the prison

00:45:15.671 --> 00:45:18.382 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
system and nothing more
costly at the state

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:21.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
level than our prison systems.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.346 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And what bang for the
buck are we getting?

00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:24.972 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
None.

00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:26.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Nobody is feeling safer than
we felt 20 years ago when

00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:28.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
we started building prisons.

00:45:28.184 --> 00:45:29.352 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: No, absolutely not.

00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:30.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And not only that,
we haven't even

00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:33.397 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
factored into this the
privatization of prisons,

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:35.650 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and there was just a
story in the headlines

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:40.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that I think a $2.6
million settlement had

00:45:40.279 --> 00:45:42.949 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to be paid as a result of
judges, who were working

00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:45.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in coercion with private
prisons to start just

00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:47.954 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
streamlining the youth
into the prisons,

00:45:47.954 --> 00:45:49.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
just shovel them over there.

00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:51.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
That just makes me sick.

00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:53.459 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And the sad thing is
it doesn't have to be that way.

00:45:53.459 --> 00:45:54.710 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: No.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:56.379 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Projects
like Prison of Peace,

00:45:56.379 --> 00:45:57.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
even though it's a fairly
small project in three or four

00:45:57.964 --> 00:46:01.092 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
prisons, and just two
lawyers trying to do good,

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:03.052 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
has demonstrated that
we can take people

00:46:03.052 --> 00:46:06.931 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
who most people would say
are societal throwaways.

00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:08.391 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
And we can redeem them.

00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:10.476 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
We can have them
transform themselves,

00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:11.978 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and they can live
lives of service.

00:46:11.978 --> 00:46:13.521 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They can be effective
peacemakers.

00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:16.649 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They can go back into their
neighborhoods as people

00:46:16.649 --> 00:46:18.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
who understand peace and
how to resolve conflict,

00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:20.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
rather than as gang bangers.

00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:22.029 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We can do it, and
there's no reason

00:46:22.029 --> 00:46:26.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
why we can't invest money in
projects like Prison of Peace,

00:46:26.158 --> 00:46:29.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
instead of investing
in building prisons

00:46:29.245 --> 00:46:31.414 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and not really
solving the problem.

00:46:31.414 --> 00:46:33.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And I think that's
really my message

00:46:33.124 --> 00:46:36.377 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is that we do have alternatives
that work that are effective

00:46:36.377 --> 00:46:39.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that are cost effective,
and it doesn't matter

00:46:39.005 --> 00:46:40.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
what your political stripe is.

00:46:40.756 --> 00:46:44.093 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If you're interested in social
change for the better, at least

00:46:44.093 --> 00:46:46.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
cost, then take a look around,
because there's some really

00:46:46.721 --> 00:46:48.055 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
good stuff out there.

00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:49.390 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: And how
are these same skills

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
playing out in halfway houses?

00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:52.351 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Because once people
get out of prison,

00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
often there are no skills.

00:46:54.186 --> 00:46:56.564 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
There's nothing to prepare
them for the outside world.

00:46:56.564 --> 00:46:58.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That's changing,
at least in California.

00:46:58.566 --> 00:47:00.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
When a person,
especially a long termer,

00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:04.572 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is preparing for parole, they
have to have a parole plan.

00:47:04.572 --> 00:47:07.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And that means they have to
go into an outside residential

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
facility, sometimes up
to a year to 18 months

00:47:10.244 --> 00:47:12.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
before they can actually
leave, and they're

00:47:12.955 --> 00:47:15.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
being programmed
in that facility

00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:17.501 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to learn how to
live a modern life.

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:19.754 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And what's really
gratifying for us

00:47:19.754 --> 00:47:23.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
is many of our Prison of
Peace trainers are now

00:47:23.257 --> 00:47:24.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
teaching Prison of Peace--

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: In the halfway houses.

00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:27.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: In the halfway houses.

00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:29.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: That's
fabulous, because that's

00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:30.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a skill that is going to serve
a person throughout the rest

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:31.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
of their life.

00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:34.268 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
OK, now I know our
viewers are thinking, OK,

00:47:34.268 --> 00:47:38.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
what is this that takes just
a few seconds to employ?

00:47:38.105 --> 00:47:40.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: So what
I'd like you to do

00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:44.153 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is-- we'll just have a
different kind of conversation.

00:47:44.153 --> 00:47:48.032 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now I want people to recognize
that what they're going to see

00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:50.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
might look very rude and
disruptive from the outside,

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.161 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but we'll just see what
your experience is.

00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:53.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So what I want
you to do, Regina,

00:47:53.913 --> 00:47:55.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is I want you tell me a story of
something that's just happened

00:47:55.581 --> 00:47:57.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to you in the last
couple of days

00:47:57.208 --> 00:47:59.960 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that has just a little bit
of emotional content to it.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.961 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
It could be happy or sad.

00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:02.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
It doesn't matter.

00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:03.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And what I'm going
to do is I'm just

00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:05.508 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
going to listen to you at a
deep, deep level in the way

00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:07.134 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
that we do.

00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:08.469 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: But does it have
to be the last couple days?

00:48:08.469 --> 00:48:09.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: It can be
whatever is important.

00:48:09.512 --> 00:48:10.721 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
No, it doesn't.

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:11.430 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Whatever comes to mind.

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.848 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: OK.

00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:17.353 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So I think that to be
in a situation where,

00:48:17.353 --> 00:48:20.981 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
for some reason, I would
say something to a person--

00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I won't get into
specifics, obviously--

00:48:22.983 --> 00:48:26.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
say something to a person,
have it totally misunderstood,

00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:27.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
and then--

00:48:27.696 --> 00:48:29.365 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That really
frustrates you.

00:48:29.365 --> 00:48:30.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yes.

00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:32.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And you feel
really disrespected,

00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:33.828 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and you don't feel listened to.

00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:36.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And it actually makes you sad.

00:48:36.288 --> 00:48:38.165 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yeah, for me,
I get sad right away.

00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:39.416 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: You get sad right away.

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
You feel a lot of
grief, because you

00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:42.545 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
feel like nobody's supporting
you or listening to you.

00:48:42.545 --> 00:48:44.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And you feel deeply abandoned.

00:48:44.004 --> 00:48:45.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: You feel
abandoned, and I

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.466 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
feel like, well, wait a minute.

00:48:47.466 --> 00:48:48.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I didn't deserve that.

00:48:48.509 --> 00:48:50.010 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
What did I say?

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.179 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
What did I do that caused
this situation to erupt?

00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:55.182 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: So you felt
unfairly judged,

00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:57.476 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and that was really
upsetting to you.

00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:59.061 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:59.061 --> 00:49:00.271 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Absolutely.

00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:01.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And at the
end of the day,

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:03.357 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
you feel really sad
and grief stricken,

00:49:03.357 --> 00:49:05.109 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
because people really are not
paying attention to who you are

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:07.611 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
and what you are doing and what
you're saying as a human being.

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:08.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Right.

00:49:08.654 --> 00:49:09.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And that's really sad.

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: It is sad.

00:49:11.073 --> 00:49:12.116 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
Yeah.

00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:13.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
That's it.

00:49:13.534 --> 00:49:15.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: So what was that
experience like for you?

00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:17.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Well,
everything, any resistance

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:22.501 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
you might have is futile,
because resistance is futile.

00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:26.922 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's so simple, but immediately,
you think, but, but, but.

00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:29.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
You're tempted to
say, but there's more.

00:49:29.717 --> 00:49:31.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But there's no
need to tell more.

00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:33.512 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The fact is you're
already grokking it

00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:37.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
with a simple reflection
of the emotions.

00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:38.517 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And how
long did that take?

00:49:38.517 --> 00:49:40.186 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: About 20
seconds, 30 maybe.

00:49:40.186 --> 00:49:41.520 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And notice that
I stopped as soon as I

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
got the, yeah, that's right.

00:49:42.855 --> 00:49:44.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And you nodded your
head, and I stopped.

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:46.692 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now for people who are
watching this, what it might've

00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:49.820 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
looked like is if I was
really interrupting you,

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and I was because I
said-- I didn't even

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:52.531 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
let you go three seconds.

00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:53.866 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: No point.

00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:55.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, but
here's the difference.

00:49:55.784 --> 00:50:00.748 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In our conversational norms, we
have rules around turn taking,

00:50:00.748 --> 00:50:02.416 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and the turn taking
rules say that when

00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:04.501 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
you stop speaking is when
I get to start talking,

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:07.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and if I start talking
before you stop talking,

00:50:07.087 --> 00:50:10.132 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
then that's considered
rude and disrespectful.

00:50:10.132 --> 00:50:11.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But remember, when
we're talking,

00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:14.053 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
we're talking from our own ego.

00:50:14.053 --> 00:50:16.722 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
When I'm listening,
there is no ego involved.

00:50:16.722 --> 00:50:18.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
All I'm doing is listening
to your emotions,

00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:21.477 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and so I can interrupt
you, as long as I'm stating

00:50:21.477 --> 00:50:23.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
your emotions back to you.

00:50:23.437 --> 00:50:25.231 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And you will not only
not feel interrupted.

00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:27.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You will feel like that
is the deepest connected

00:50:27.399 --> 00:50:29.652 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
conversational or listening
I've ever experienced.

00:50:29.652 --> 00:50:31.237 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:50:31.237 --> 00:50:34.865 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And this is the
counterintuitive part of this

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:37.409 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
technique and skill is
that people have to learn

00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:40.496 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to overcome their
social inhibition to--

00:50:40.496 --> 00:50:42.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Jump in.

00:50:42.248 --> 00:50:45.292 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: --jump in, and not to
feel like they are patronizing

00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:50.422 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
or that it's OK to tell
you what your feelings are.

00:50:50.422 --> 00:50:52.591 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
There is a term, and
the term is a big word,

00:50:52.591 --> 00:50:54.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
but it's called alexithymia.

00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:57.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Alexithymia is the
inability to state

00:50:57.554 --> 00:51:00.391 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
what you're experiencing
in emotional words.

00:51:00.391 --> 00:51:02.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And at a clinical
level, it's quite bad,

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:05.104 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but everybody experiences
it, because we don't have

00:51:05.104 --> 00:51:06.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
strong emotional vocabularies.

00:51:06.772 --> 00:51:10.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
All I'm doing is helping you
build the neural connections

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:11.610 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
between different
parts of your brain

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
so that you can take
what you've experienced,

00:51:14.321 --> 00:51:17.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and put it into words, put
your feelings into words.

00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:18.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: OK, I have
a question then.

00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:21.912 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
As you said, that makes
you feel frustrated,

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:24.456 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and it makes you not feel
heard, blah, blah, blah.

00:51:24.456 --> 00:51:26.083 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
And it ends it up in sad.

00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:27.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Now does it always
end up in sad?

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Almost always.

00:51:29.378 --> 00:51:31.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It almost always comes
down to being abandoned.

00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:33.674 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Being abandoned and
feeling alone in the world.

00:51:33.674 --> 00:51:35.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And feeling alone
in the world, almost always.

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:38.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The layers are anger
and frustration.

00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:41.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Then beneath that, disrespect,
not being listened to, deep

00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:42.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and abiding injustice.

00:51:42.057 --> 00:51:43.809 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Beneath that, fear and anxiety.

00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:45.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Beneath that, sadness and grief.

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:48.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then finally underneath,
absolute utter loneliness

00:51:48.355 --> 00:51:50.399 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and being totally
abandoned in the world.

00:51:50.399 --> 00:51:52.609 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And we all experience
the same emotions,

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:54.194 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
because we're all human beings.

00:51:54.194 --> 00:51:55.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And we experience
them in the same way

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.489 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in the same layers
in the same levels,

00:51:57.489 --> 00:52:01.285 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and once you learn this,
that seven billion people

00:52:01.285 --> 00:52:03.746 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
on the planet are all
the same, this technique

00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:05.080 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
works with anybody.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.415 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It doesn't matter
what your culture is.

00:52:06.415 --> 00:52:07.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It doesn't matter what
your ethnicity is.

00:52:07.708 --> 00:52:09.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It doesn't matter
what your gender is.

00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:11.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It works because the human
brain responds to this

00:52:11.712 --> 00:52:12.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
in exactly the same way.

00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:14.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Otherwise, you
wouldn't be human.

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.716 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
That's what makes
it so powerful.

00:52:15.716 --> 00:52:17.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: You're good.

00:52:17.468 --> 00:52:19.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And you can deescalate
anybody in 30 seconds or less

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:21.096 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
using this technique.

00:52:21.096 --> 00:52:22.931 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: So again,
taking the responsibility.

00:52:22.931 --> 00:52:26.894 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Even someone watching,
just this, says,

00:52:26.894 --> 00:52:28.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OK, I think I can do this.

00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:30.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I think I can do it.

00:52:30.189 --> 00:52:32.316 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Can a person just take
what we've just done here

00:52:32.316 --> 00:52:34.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
on themselves, and
then find themselves

00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:38.447 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in an argument with their child
or their spouse or something?

00:52:38.447 --> 00:52:41.325 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: I would say
no, only because people

00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:45.037 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
are going to fall back to the
old, bad listening skills.

00:52:45.037 --> 00:52:47.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Because your ego
starts becoming involved.

00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:48.957 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: That's right.

00:52:48.957 --> 00:52:50.626 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You're either paying
attention to the words.

00:52:50.626 --> 00:52:52.920 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You want to give advice, or
you emotionally invalidate,

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.421 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or you start putting
an I statement,

00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:55.964 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and you start asking questions.

00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:57.716 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You have to practice
yourself out

00:52:57.716 --> 00:52:59.426 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of those old forms
of verbal response.

00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:00.761 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:01.929 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Tell us the name of
that website again.

00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:03.222 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Itspuremagic.com.

00:53:03.222 --> 00:53:04.431 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Itspuremagic.com.

00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:07.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: And it's a
referring website

00:53:07.393 --> 00:53:10.896 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that will take you over to the
website, where the course is.

00:53:10.896 --> 00:53:12.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: Excellent.

00:53:12.106 --> 00:53:14.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And what an investment
too for $50.

00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:18.445 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Learn to essentially bypass
conflict in your life

00:53:18.445 --> 00:53:19.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
permanently.

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:20.864 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: It is amazing
how this works.

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.491 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
I'm teaching this
in schools now.

00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:24.701 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
I'm teaching teachers how to
deescalate angry students.

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:27.121 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
So the whole purpose
is not to kick kids out

00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:28.997 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
of the classroom for
being disruptive,

00:53:28.997 --> 00:53:30.958 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
but getting them calmed
down immediately.

00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:32.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And the teachers are
telling me stories--

00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:35.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it brings tears to your eyes
when you hear what's going on,

00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:37.506 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and what the teachers are
learning about the children

00:53:37.506 --> 00:53:38.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that they're working with.

00:53:38.757 --> 00:53:40.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I mean, I just don't believe it.

00:53:40.259 --> 00:53:43.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And the families-- I mean,
it's just unbelievable.

00:53:43.303 --> 00:53:45.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This is the greatest
work I've ever done.

00:53:45.013 --> 00:53:47.641 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I am so overjoyed and blessed
to be able to do this,

00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:50.853 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and to sit here and talk with
you and tell people about this,

00:53:50.853 --> 00:53:52.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because it is absolutely
life changing.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: It's meaningful.

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.899 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
It's deeply meaningful.

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:58.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And thank you for having the
courage to basically trash

00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:01.196 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
your career and your
bank count to do this

00:54:01.196 --> 00:54:02.239 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and offer this to people.

00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:03.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;NOLL: Well, thank you.

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:05.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;REGINA: I know that it takes
a sacrifice, and the fact

00:54:05.784 --> 00:54:09.455 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
that you are so passionate, and
you're so sensitive and caring,

00:54:09.455 --> 00:54:10.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
good on you.

00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:11.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Thank you so much.

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And what I want to do is run
one little clip at the end.

00:54:13.876 --> 00:54:16.795 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's a statement of hope from
one of the women in prison.

00:54:16.795 --> 00:54:17.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Let's take a look.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
[video playback]

00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:25.012 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-The awakening moment for
me with Prison of Peace

00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:31.185 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
would be I did a peace
circle in an organization

00:54:31.185 --> 00:54:33.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that I started called YUP.

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.939 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And it's called
Young United Players,

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:39.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and it's for kids that were 17
or younger when they committed

00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:40.903 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
their crimes, such as myself.

00:54:40.903 --> 00:54:45.032 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And I did this peace circle
with these girls, and I thought,

00:54:45.032 --> 00:54:46.325 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
this is a very rowdy crowd.

00:54:46.325 --> 00:54:48.243 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
They're 18, 19 years old.

00:54:48.243 --> 00:54:49.912 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They're not going
to understand this,

00:54:49.912 --> 00:54:51.788 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but I'm going to try it
anyways, because they

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:54.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
were very loud and kind of
obnoxious at the moment.

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:56.210 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And I thought, I've got
to try to do this talking

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:58.504 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
piece with them and pass
this around and let them know

00:54:58.504 --> 00:55:00.339 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
what a peace circle is about.

00:55:00.339 --> 00:55:06.803 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And I ended up telling them
what a peace circle was

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:08.805 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and explaining what
I'm going to do

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:11.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and what's going to
happen with the process,

00:55:11.642 --> 00:55:16.939 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and it went so amazingly well
that these girls, all they want

00:55:16.939 --> 00:55:18.732 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to do is peace circles now.

00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:21.527 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And in almost every
group that we have,

00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:22.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
are we going to
do a peace circle?

00:55:22.945 --> 00:55:24.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Are we going to
do a peace circle?

00:55:24.363 --> 00:55:26.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And it's just so cute to
see them really, really

00:55:26.406 --> 00:55:27.866 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
want to learn this.

00:55:27.866 --> 00:55:30.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And they're really getting
something out of it.

00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:32.454 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And for me, that was
a wakening experience

00:55:32.454 --> 00:55:34.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to realize that it
really does work,

00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:38.085 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and even when there was a
little bit of doubt in my mind

00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:40.212 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that, are peace circles
really going to work?

00:55:40.212 --> 00:55:42.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Are people really
going to look at them?

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:43.882 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
That just said it
all right there.

00:55:43.882 --> 00:55:49.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And seeing how they just changed
and the whole situation went

00:55:49.388 --> 00:55:51.765 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
so well, it just inspired
me to do it more.

00:55:51.765 --> 00:55:53.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

00:55:56.103 --> 00:55:58.689 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
The stories are heart rending
and give us a fresh perspective

00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:01.233 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
on how to view people who have
ended up in the unfortunate

00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:03.485 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:75%
circumstance of incarceration.

00:56:03.485 --> 00:56:05.571 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
