[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.508 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Dr. Jack
Kruse is here with us once

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:10%
again to put some myths
to bed and tell us about

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.520 align:middle line:10%
the incredible power
of our immune system,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.060 align:middle line:10%
and some tips to
boost it if we can.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I know I've got to tell you
right off, I'm afraid of you.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not easily intimidated,
but you're so brilliant.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And your ideas here, your
knowledge is so vast.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle line:90%
It all comes together so fast.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm hanging on by
my fingernails,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:90%
meaning our audience is too.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So what I'll do is say, Jack,
can you say that in English?

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you tell us-- can
you slow it down for us?

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:90%
You know, deal with us.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So we want to start right off
with thank you for coming back.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.987 align:middle line:84%
I know you're a super
busy man, first.

00:00:56.987 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:10%
>> JACK KRUSE: No problem.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going to
be looking at the immune system

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to come down to--

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it's coming
down to water and light.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And these are concepts
that haven't been brought

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:90%
into the conversation, right?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Correct.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I was
all excited recently

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
because I read this article and
a study that had taken place

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
among 8,000 healthy
people, no apparent illness

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:90%
had been noted at that point.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
their pathology

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and they looked at
94 different factors,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:84%
they found in 42% of
them significant levels

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
of HIV, herpes, hep B
and C, papillo virus,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.942 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get back to
that in a moment, especially

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:90%
the HIV portion of it.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, wow, these
T-cells are amazing.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.773 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying, but
wait a minute, right?

00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Well, you have
to go, wait a minute.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:10%
People have to understand
what a virus does.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:10%
It modifies mitochondrial
energy production.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.425 align:middle line:10%
So that tells us
right off the bat

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:10%
that what's going on
in the environment

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:10%
is actually a really big
deal for different people.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in
the COVID-19 story,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
most people know that people
who are African-American

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
or Latino, who have darker
skin, are faring differently

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:84%
than people with whiter
skin, especially when they're

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:90%
in different latitudes.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is the media then
starts putting all this on,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:84%
like it has to do with poverty,
it has to do with diet,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and putting-- laying all
these other social commentary

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:90%
over it.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
that isn't true.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.258 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: No, it's not.

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:34.848 align:middle line:84%
This is a quantum
biologic problem.

00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean in English?

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:84%
It means it's a
story about light.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
people who have darker skin,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
whether Latino or
African-American,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:84%
are adapted from an evolutionary
basis within the 20's.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the Tropic of
Capricorn and Cancer,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:84%
why their skin is based to stay
out in the sun for longer times

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to make the same
amount of vitamin D

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:90%
that you and I can make.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
You're likely an
uncoupled haplotype

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:90%
from the top of the world.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm from the 59th latitude.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have freckles
on my skin because

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.460 align:middle line:90%
of my Irish descent.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
It means that you and I can
spend a little bit of time

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:84%
out in the sun, raise our
vitamin D levels up enough

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to control both our innate
and adaptive immunity.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:84%
If we had an African-American
family member,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
they'd have to stay out there
four to five times as long.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you consider that
an African-American who

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:84%
relocates to Detroit,
it should be no shock

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
why people are now starting to
see, even in the epidemiology,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that those people are having
a much bigger problem.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a racial problem.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a quantum
biological problem.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, doctors
have not done a good job

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.878 align:middle line:90%
understanding those issues.

00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have so many
things I want to get to with

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking
at the HIV factor

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:90%
in COVID-19, how this occurred.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:90%
You're fully aware of it.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.125 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of Luc--

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Montagnier.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Montagnier, a Nobel
Prize winner in France that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:90%
brought this up very early on.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I read about it in February,
in the South China News

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:90%
they brought it up as well.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Launch into this
story in plain English

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
so we can understand
you, and why

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:84%
it's created such a shroud of
mystery, chaos, and confusion

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:90%
around a "coronavirus."

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Well, the number one
thing I'll say before I say any

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
of the facts, you need to
realize the fact checkers

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%
on social media, the fact
checkers on Mockingbird media,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
which is mainstream media,
they are going to try to quell

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:90%
the story.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's a couple
of things, especially

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.570 align:middle line:84%
the viewers in the United
States need to know.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Gain of function studies--

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Which are legal
in the United States,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:84%
this is the reason why you
will not hear about these.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Explain
gain of function.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Gain of function
is basically where

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory we can mix
different proteins with viruses

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
to get a specific result,
either to get treatment,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.642 align:middle line:84%
or to find out more
about how a virus works.

00:04:55.642 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Most people who are
going to watch a show

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
realize that HIV today still
doesn't have a vaccine.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:84%
We use protease inhibitors
to actually treat it.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they're
trying to figure out,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
coronaviruses are the viruses
that most people know about

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:90%
that cause the common cold.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:90%
They cause influenza.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
We don't have-- contrary
to popular belief,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
there's never been one
successful human coronavirus

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:90%
vaccine.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Yet when you hear
the people on mainstream news,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.145 align:middle line:84%
it's like, oh, at
the end of this year,

00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:27.735 align:middle line:90%
we're going to have a vaccine.

00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, we should
stop for a minute

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and realize that this story goes
all the way back to the 1950s

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
when we had the polio
vaccine from Salk.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There was the biggest
medical mistake

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:90%
probably in the 20th century.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
Cutter incident.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Most modern doctors today--

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm old enough where
I learned about this

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.600 align:middle line:84%
because it occurred to one of
the people in my residency.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:84%
But most modern doctors don't
realize that the vaccine wasn't

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:90%
properly tested.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.760 align:middle line:84%
It was given in the 1950s
and sent all over the world.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the countries that
got afflicted by it was China.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And basically what happened
with the original Salk vaccine

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
from this pharmaceutical
company called

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Cutter is that people got
infected with a monkey virus

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:90%
called SV40.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, for those people who
are paying attention at home,

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:90%
SV means simian virus.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yep.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: 40 means
there was 39 others.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:84%
It turns out there
was a whole bunch.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:90%
It turns out that if--

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
you and I are both old
enough to know this.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Your viewers may not be.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Where did HIV come from?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:90%
It came from a simian virus.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you were around during
the Reagan administration,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:84%
you may have remembered
that gate key fact is

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:84%
that they believe it came
from Africans that we're

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:90%
eating monkey brains.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:90%
That was the "story."

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it
was at Stanleyville,

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
at the facility in Stanleyville,
where they were doing it,

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:84%
because I know a former member
of the intelligence community,

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
who has since deceased, who
would be around 80 years old

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.552 align:middle line:84%
by now, who admitted he had
worked in that facility with

00:06:59.552 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Correct.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.965 align:middle line:84%
But what I was trying
to explain to you

00:07:01.965 --> 00:07:04.660 align:middle line:84%
is the story we got in
the Reagan administration.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:90%
So fast forward now to 2019.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Montagnier looked at the
protein that was present.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:84%
He noticed that Gp41,
which is an HIV protein,

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:90%
was on this bat coronavirus.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said immediately
that was a sure fingerprint

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.720 align:middle line:84%
that this was manufactured
for some reason.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
The key that you
need to ask yourself,

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:84%
why would a government
official who's

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
been in the administration
since Reagan

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:90%
be allowed to transfer money?

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, the number one reason
is gain of function studies

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:84%
weren't able to be done
in the United States.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Number two issue
was did this have

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:84%
something to do with
the Cutter incident that

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:90%
goes all the way back.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And is that the reason why
China and the United States

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:84%
now have this big
contentious trade war?

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And why has coronavirus
become a political hot potato

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:90%
versus a medical hot potato.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now we need
to talk about the production

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:90%
of D3.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.440 align:middle line:84%
We need to talk
about the role of D3

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:90%
in the production of T-cells.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:84%
So now in plain English tell
us how it works if we go

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Jack's way.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: OK.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.345 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's-- the only thing
you need to understand.

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use one term
you may or may not know.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.875 align:middle line:90%
It's called mitochondria.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Mitochondria, the best
way to think about it,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
is the Ferrari engine
that's in your car.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
It makes all the
energy in your body.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:84%
The input to that is
electron chain transport.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It's got a spinning
head called an ATPase.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Electron chain transport
uses electrons.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:90%
The ATPase uses protons.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're back at
negative and positive.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:90%
We're back to basic electricity.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So the battery in you
works by electric charge.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:90%
How does it work in you?

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:90%
The sun is a cathode ray.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
You live on a
planet called Earth.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:90%
That's an anode.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Anytime a cathode hits an
anode, free electrons come up.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.410 align:middle line:90%
So guess what.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Assuming you have leather
shoes on, or no shoes,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
like I usually do, you get
free energy just from that.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
It means you don't
have to eat as much.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned something earlier.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
People who are heavier who
have low vitamin D status tend

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:90%
to get COVID.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.657 align:middle line:90%
Now you're beginning to see.

00:09:10.657 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't have
a big electric charge

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:90%
in their colony of mitochondria.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Who else gets that problem?

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
It turns out if you have
African-American skin or Latin

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
skin, and you live
at a high latitude,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:90%
that's like being a cactus--

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or if
you're indoors all day.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Well--

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Either way,
lifestyle's a big part of it.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
artificial light, too.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Right.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big deal,
because what happens,

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:84%
you don't have that
charge in your system

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:90%
to run your Ferrari engine.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
So what do I teach people?

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I teach people how to
maximize natural light,

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
minimize artificial light,
maximize water production,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:90%
because-- here's a big part--

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
mitochondria do the exact
opposite of photosynthesis.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So the last time
you had me on we

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
talked about how food
and photosynthesis link.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's give them a
quick recap very quickly.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:90%
You take CO2 from the air.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Take water and sunlight.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:90%
It makes sugar.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.290 align:middle line:90%
That's photosynthesis.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:90%
What do mitochondria do?

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:90%
They reverse that process.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.330 align:middle line:84%
We take sugar and make
CO2, which we breathe out,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:90%
and we make water.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It turns out there's a special
chemical in your mitochondria

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.460 align:middle line:90%
called cytochrome c oxidase.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to remember that.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's got four red
light chromophore.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It turns out the sun, the most
predominant part of the sun,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
is red light, infrared-A.
42% of the sun is there.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now I've
got to stop you for a sec

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.003 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people here
have been hearing all about

00:10:31.003 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
the far and near
infrared devices.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:90%
I have one myself.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:90%
And we talked off camera.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And you said that
does not include--

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Correct.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.675 align:middle line:84%
You want to use more
infrared-A over near infrared.

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:90%
You have to realize--

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Infrared-A.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Yeah.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And infrared-A covers
the frequencies

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:84%
between 600 and
1,000 nanometers.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that
is the most important

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:90%
for mitochondrial health.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: That's what
you need to know.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.783 align:middle line:84%
So what are the four
red light chromophores?

00:10:56.783 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:90%
620, 680, 760, 860.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:84%
That's what nature
has put in all of us.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the light that penetrates
our body 10 to 30 centimeters.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:84%
The other frequencies
of light don't do that.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So when you understand
that's the reason why

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I want your skin and
eyes in the game,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%
because what does that do?

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:84%
In your Ferrari that you may
have outside in the parking

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%
lot, to keep the
engine's running,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:90%
you need to have a mechanic.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
God or evolution,
whoever you believe in,

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
put two change programs
in you called autophagy

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:90%
and apoptosis--

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: That those two change
programs maximize your energy

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:90%
efficiency.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So apoptosis is when you
take bad engines out.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're so
bad they can't be fixed.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:90%
You just replace them.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Autophagy is the recycling of
the parts of your bad engine.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.223 align:middle line:90%
It's not bad enough.

00:11:47.223 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
We can fix it, and
make it better.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.980 align:middle line:84%
It turns out different
parts of the frequency

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:90%
of sunlight controls those.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
The last time you had me here,
I had a purple jacket on.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Purple
because UV light.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: That
controls apoptosis.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the sun's--

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have a
red jacket on today.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.027 align:middle line:84%
You're just not
wearing it on set.

00:12:03.027 --> 00:12:04.313 align:middle line:90%
It was a beautiful red, claré.

00:12:04.313 --> 00:12:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: And the reason
why I wore the red is

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
because the other
side is autophagy.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And autophagy recycles all
the things in the cell.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Why is this a big deal?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's cycle it back
to cytochrome--

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:90%
I should say to COVID-19.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
autophagy controls

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:90%
innate and adaptive immunity.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't know that.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what--

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.003 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Say that again.

00:12:26.003 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: It turns out that
autophagy in the mitochondria

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:84%
controls your efficiency to
fight off bacterial, fungal,

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:90%
and viral infections.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It's very complicated,
but bottom line

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:84%
is everybody knows that
those things present antigens

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:90%
to the immune system.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, the COVID-19
antigen has to be

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:84%
presented to something
called MHC-I. Well,

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:90%
guess what does that.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
What process in your
mitochondria does that?

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Autophagy.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:90%
So guess what.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.717 align:middle line:84%
If you live in an
office building,

00:12:55.717 --> 00:12:57.800 align:middle line:84%
or you're African-American
and you live in Detroit

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and you never go
outside, or you're

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:84%
400 pounds because
you never go outside

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and you watch Jerry Springer
all day, guess what happens.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:84%
You cannot present the antigen
to the immune system so that

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:84%
you can make antibodies
from your B-cells.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
what am I saying?

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:90%
You're energy inefficient.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you can't do what
mother nature put in you.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can't
create antibodies.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:90%
And what about T-cells?

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: T-cells are
part of the other side,

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
which is the adaptive
immune system.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
The adaptive immune
system allows

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle line:90%
us to take out infected cells.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.827 align:middle line:84%
So even if you do get infected,
the natural killer T-cells

00:13:31.827 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:90%
can get rid of them.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:84%
What's the T-cell that
controls the whole process?

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It's called the T
regulator cells.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.240 align:middle line:84%
T regulator cells actually
inform the B-cells.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
The B-cells are what makes the
antibody that, hey, there's

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:90%
COVID-19 in our system.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:84%
We need to mount an antibody
response to get rid of that.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.395 align:middle line:84%
The antibodies
mark the cells that

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:84%
are infected so the
natural killer cells can

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:90%
come and take them out.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:90%
This can't happen.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So basically what I'm telling
you is when you understand

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that the thing that controls
both innate and adaptive

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
immunity is actually
mitochondrial autophagy,

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:84%
you've got to ask yourself,
how much do I know about this?

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
How much does my
doctor know about this?

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Zippo.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Right.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.877 align:middle line:84%
And most doctors
don't realize it.

00:14:14.877 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But what doctors
do know is they do

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:84%
know that vitamin D levels are
a proxy for how well autophagy

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and apoptosis work.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and we have
kind of en masse a deficiency

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.785 align:middle line:84%
of vitamin D. Almost everyone
that gets their labs back are

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:90%
deficient in vitamin D.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Correct.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason why
is because the way we

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:90%
live our life in America.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.850 align:middle line:84%
We tend to live it
under artificial light,

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
on camera, inside of
offices, behind glass.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned to you
before we came out here.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Just by being behind
glass-- people

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
don't realize this-- it blocks
all the purple UV light.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.205 align:middle line:84%
It blocks 40% to 60%
of the red light.

00:14:47.205 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:84%
But it has no effect on the
blue light that's in the sun.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So on a relative basis,
you're blue light

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:90%
toxic just by living inside.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the major
diseases that are not

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
really related to COVID, but
is tied to it is fibromyalgia.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.465 align:middle line:84%
It's usually an inside
disease because people

00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:90%
are blue light toxic.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Most people talk about it from
cell phones and computers.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I want people to know the
biggest immune help is this.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.117 align:middle line:84%
If you're an inside
person, put these on.

00:15:15.117 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We were
talking about this.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:90%
You look like Sonny Bono.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
You look like you're chilling
in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Well, the reason
why these are important,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:90%
what do they do?

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:90%
It blocks--

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.438 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Orange,
they're orange, right?

00:15:26.438 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: They're orange, but
they block 435 to 465 light,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
which turns out to be the
things that make chemicals

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:84%
in your body that are
called "free radicals"

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
that actually destroy innate
and adaptive immunity.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:90%
So guess what.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:84%
This is something you want to
wear when you're in blue light.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
When you're outside,
you do not want

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:90%
to put a tarp over your eyes.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you want the natural
parts of sunlight in so that

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:84%
the innate and adaptive
system are programmed properly

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
by that big ball
of gas in the sky.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is just a slight
detour here for a moment.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Someone like me, who wears
hard contact lenses--

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: You don't
want to talk to me.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
why I'm asking.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Well,
the reason why is--

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're kind of a
soft green so I can find them

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:90%
when they fall in the water.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Yeah.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.805 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why you don't want

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
to do that-- you and I are
at your house in California.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:90%
We plant an orange tree.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Your boyfriend comes out,
and puts all the nutrients,

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and everything in the
ground, and then you come out

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.220 align:middle line:90%
and put a tarp over it.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to get any oranges?

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.207 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: All right, Regina--

00:16:24.207 --> 00:16:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We happen to grow
mandarin oranges on our farm.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.652 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Regina, I want
you to think about this.

00:16:28.652 --> 00:16:31.570 align:middle line:84%
You know that all contact lenses
affect the frequency of light

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:90%
from the sun.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:32.645 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I know this.

00:16:32.645 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.915 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: What sits 3
inches behind your eye?

00:16:34.915 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Your pituitary gland.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Pituitary.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: What does it make?

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It makes all the
chemicals in your body.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.953 align:middle line:84%
What's the one that we talked
about earlier with you?

00:16:42.953 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:90%
ACTH and POMC.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:45.143 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:45.143 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: And thyroid
hormone, and things like that.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle line:84%
People will be
shocked to hear this.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Thyroid hormone and
melanin in your skin,

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:84%
which is tied to this
C-19 story, guess what.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:90%
it's made from tyrosine.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.440 align:middle line:84%
You know that kinase that
we talked about before?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.380 align:middle line:90%
It's tied to that.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So people who have
hypothyroidism and white skin

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
need more sun to
become an absorber

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic
radiation from the sun.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.310 align:middle line:90%
So guess what.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:15.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the real reason why
low vitamin D levels are

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.834 align:middle line:90%
tied to a higher risk of C-19.

00:17:17.834 --> 00:17:20.677 align:middle line:90%
See, the story isn't as simple--

00:17:20.677 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: COVID-19.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Exactly right.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not as simple
as people think.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
But I want to make sure
that they understand.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Being in the sun is not
equivalent to taking vitamin D

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:90%
pills.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:84%
That's OK for a
short period of time,

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.210 align:middle line:84%
but you need to have
your skin and your eyes

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.738 align:middle line:84%
in the game of
nature if you want

00:17:37.738 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:90%
to have a strong immune system.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it's
interesting because Sweden

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
spends most of their time not
in the sun, as a matter of fact.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting that they--

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: From the latitude.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From the
latitude point of view.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.293 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: But what do Swedes do?

00:17:47.293 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, they're much
more invested in their health

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:50.825 align:middle line:90%
than were we.

00:17:50.825 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: No.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
They're much more
outdoor than we are.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what-- yes, they are.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: And what
do they do there?

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:84%
They cross-country
ski, and they ski.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, they do.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: How do they get
their sun even when it's weak?

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.930 align:middle line:84%
It's called the albedo
effect off the snow.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.138 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:18:02.138 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: You have
the same effect when

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
you're in California,
and you go out on a boat.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.603 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Most people out
there will wear Chanel glasses

00:18:08.603 --> 00:18:09.570 align:middle line:90%
to block the UV light.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to do that.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.650 align:middle line:90%
You want to be out there.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.358 align:middle line:84%
That's why you see my
face the way it is.

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:90%
I just came from Destin.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm not afraid of the sun.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.485 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe what
the dermatologists

00:18:18.485 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and ophthalmologists
are selling.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.004 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:20.004 --> 00:18:20.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't either.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Because guess what.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:84%
We're designed by nature
to live in nature.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:10%
When we need to get
out of the sun, when

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:10%
we don't have a
good solar callus,

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:10%
we'll do what a kangaroo
does or what a lion does.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:10%
We go under a tree.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, we do
things crazier than that.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
We go inside behind glass that
further alters the spectrum.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
most people don't even

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:90%
realize how that's a big deal.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Or we'll go and buy an iPad and
blow our eyes out from that.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: That's
what gets us sick.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.967 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk really
practically here.

00:18:51.967 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think you have people's
attention about getting out

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:84%
in the sunshine if they
have proximity to it.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So is it OK to go out earlier in
the day, like 8:00, 9:00, 10:00

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:84%
in the morning instead
of at high noon.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.328 align:middle line:84%
Like I just feel like it's
frying me any time after 11:00.

00:19:06.328 --> 00:19:07.995 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: We do have
to talk about this.

00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Because
the answer is yes,

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:84%
but then you have to
realize there's a context.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.443 align:middle line:84%
This is where being a
doctor is a big deal.

00:19:15.443 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:84%
If I would tell
you the number one

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.945 align:middle line:84%
thing for COVID-19
prescription is

00:19:19.945 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:84%
you must see the
sunrise every morning.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.667 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:22.667 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's the best time.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Right.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And that sets the
circadian rhythms

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
in your body that
control B and T cells.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Most of that light is
what we call red light.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let that in
your eyes when it's rising.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.025 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: On your skin, too.

00:19:35.025 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You can feel it.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Be as naked as you
possibly can be when you do

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
That, I would tell you, is
probably 80% of the battle.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
The key is you mentioned
you don't like midday sun.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:90%
But remember.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:90%
How do you make vitamin D?

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.498 align:middle line:84%
You only make it
during solar noon.

00:19:49.498 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:90%
Now, that changes with seasons.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.710 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the latitude.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It also depends on what's
your Fitzpatrick skin type.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:90%
You and I are both ones.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:84%
We can make vitamin
D relatively quick,

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:90%
depending on where we're at.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if you went
in the noonday sun as kind

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:84%
of a Caucasian pale
folks, more or less,

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
how long do you need
to be in the sun?

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Well, that's where
I'm going to tell you you have

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:90%
to build your solar callus.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to use red
light to do that.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.445 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
red light on your skin,

00:20:14.445 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:84%
it preconditions your skin so
when you go out in UV light

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.140 align:middle line:84%
you don't get French
fried like a lobster.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: That's actually how
nature's built us to work.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that's
not how we live our life.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Most people stay
in, and they just go out

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:84%
in the midday sun,
and they get red.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:84%
If you understand
how to do this,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:84%
then you can get the UV light to
convert cholesterol to vitamin

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:90%
D so that you make it.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:84%
The key thing is you don't
need as much as you think.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The key is it's going to depend
on what your vitamin D level is

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:90%
before you start this process.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: What it is now.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
just had mine done.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:84%
As a guy who's from Ireland
at the 59th latitude,

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm at 121 naturally.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't supplement.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So you need to understand
how to use the sun,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
but I would tell
you, if you start,

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.360 align:middle line:84%
the first hour of sunlight
in the morning's important.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.943 align:middle line:84%
I would even tell you the last
hour of sunlight before sunset.

00:20:59.943 --> 00:21:01.318 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
when I like it.

00:21:01.318 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Because it's
mostly balanced by red.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:90%
But you have to be in it.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
You still need that
midday, but you only

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.747 align:middle line:84%
need to probably precondition
your skin 10 or 15 minutes.

00:21:10.747 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And as you get more
of that red light,

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:84%
you can use more
of the midday sun

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:84%
to get your vitamin
D levels up high.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Because what is the COVID-19
"range" for Jack Kruse?

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:90%
60 to 120 nanograms.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Most
people are like at 10.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Well, I
wouldn't say 10.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:90%
But they're below 30.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: And the reference
range for most of the labs

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
in the United
States is 30 to 100.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.915 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Europe has
different metrics.

00:21:32.915 --> 00:21:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're
saying 60 to 120.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: 120.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing for
women with breast cancer.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I tell them I want
them that level so

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that they can
protect themselves,

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
that the sun is

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
a vaccine for all mitochondrial
diseases, not just C-19.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Can I share one
little thing with you?

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Sure.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So about
25, 30 years ago,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I was reading about the sun,
everything you're talking

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
about, except not quite as much
as you're talking about it.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
let's do this thing.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.650 align:middle line:90%
It was winter, January.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a friend that
was handy at carpentry

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:84%
build what I called a sun
box, and my friends called--

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:84%
because they were
being hypnotized

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:90%
by the media-- a solar coffin.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And what it was was this little
three-sided plywood thing.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So your little lawn chair,
you're sitting at an angle.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It would cover your body
from the sides and the ends

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:84%
so you could lie in privacy
even in a small postage stamp

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:84%
backyard, unless someone
was looking down on you,

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:90%
and you could nude sunbathe.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Well, you know what?

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.282 align:middle line:84%
We have different
things now, Regina.

00:22:36.282 --> 00:22:37.652 align:middle line:90%
We have things called Kinikis.

00:22:37.652 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What's that?

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Those are bathing
suits and smocks for ladies

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:84%
that allow the sun to
go right through them.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.010 align:middle line:90%
So I tell all my ladies that.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's great.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.132 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Guys, I want them out
as buck ass naked as they can

00:22:50.132 --> 00:22:50.190 align:middle line:90%
get.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:90%
A little more modest.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Right.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Until they build
up their callus.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But for ladies,
it's a bigger deal.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Because there's
other issues with them.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, your
breasts and everything.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Like breast
cancer and things like that.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But guys, it's a big deal,
because the correlate

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.955 align:middle line:84%
for female breast cancer is
actually male prostate cancer.

00:23:06.955 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are both
epithelial diseases that

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.872 align:middle line:90%
are linked to vitamin D levels.

00:23:09.872 --> 00:23:10.672 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:23:10.672 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: So the reason
why this is all important,

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:84%
because, remember, cancer is
also an immune disregulation

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:90%
problem of mitochondria.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.118 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: So when you
begin to understand, hey,

00:23:23.118 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:90%
this isn't just a C-19 story.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:84%
There is a bigger story
going on here about really

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
how our immune system
works or doesn't work.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Almost every epithelial cancer
in humans is tied to what?

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Low vitamin D levels, and
that includes the cancers

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
that the dermatologists
worry about.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I always
bring this point up

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:90%
to dermatologists.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:84%
You tell people to put sun cream
on and wear all these things.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.713 align:middle line:84%
But why is it that melanoma,
squamous cell and basal

00:23:48.713 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:84%
cell are always associated
with low vitamin D levels

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:90%
if the sun causes the disease?

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: It turns out--

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good question.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: It's not that.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.922 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: It's the
artificial light--

00:23:56.922 --> 00:23:57.722 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:57.722 --> 00:23:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: That we allow
in our environment.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then what about--
you were looking at HCQ zinc

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and Z-Pak if someone happens
to become symptomatic.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Correct.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The reason why these
work, hydrochloroquine

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:90%
is an antibiotic.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.768 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows that
it's used for malaria.

00:24:14.768 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:90%
But it has other effects.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the effects that it
has, it actually works directly

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:19.500 align:middle line:90%
on your mitochondria.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.275 align:middle line:84%
It tends to work better
earlier in the disease process.

00:24:24.275 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But what does it
functionally do?

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a zinc ionophore.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:84%
It turns out zinc is actually
one of the things that

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:90%
blocks viral replication.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: It has a lot
of different effects,

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:90%
but it's a big deal.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.655 align:middle line:84%
Zinc is also important
in photoisomerization,

00:24:38.655 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:84%
the step that makes
vitamin D in your skin.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: So you're beginning
to see, oh, wow, look at that.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:90%
We're back at that story again.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: These are all links.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: And it turns
out zinc is also important

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:84%
for your mitochondria
making water in your body.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So there is the light
and the water side of it.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
See, most doctors
believe that HCQ is only

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.470 align:middle line:90%
a malarial antibiotic.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand how that
antibiotic alters autophagy

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:90%
in mitochondria to make energy.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So the key is if that
can help you make

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:90%
more energy, what does that do?

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It improves innate
and adaptive immunity

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:84%
so you can stay away
and fight the disease.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
that medicine does it.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.380 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
called ivermectin.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:84%
That's an antiparasitic
medicine that works.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.260 align:middle line:84%
There's another one that
they're using in Houston.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I forget the name of it,
but it's like RHS 100.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:90%
They've started using that.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It's also a medicine that
works on mitochondrial energy

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:90%
production.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:90%
So why do I keep saying this?

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I want people to
know that anything

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.390 align:middle line:84%
that improves mitochondrial
function will help.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.590 align:middle line:84%
You asked me a question before
we came on about coenzyme Q10.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said to you,
coenzyme Q10 shuttles

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.040 align:middle line:84%
electrons from cytochrome
1 to cytochrome 3.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
That's going to improve
energy production.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason why it helps.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize
that if you just look--

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It affects all
cellular function, right?

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.638 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: It affects a
lot of different things.

00:26:03.638 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But not everybody can get
the benefit of coenzyme Q10

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.780 align:middle line:84%
if it turns out their
respiratory proteins

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.060 align:middle line:84%
on the mitochondria
are spread out.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Coenzyme Q10 doesn't
have as big an effect.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Because they have to be within
a certain quantum distance.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how would
we even know that?

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:90%
You just throw some in--

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Get out in the sun.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:90%
We already covered it.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.592 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this
is appropriate or not,

00:26:27.592 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:84%
but I think it--
you just tell me.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Because of this HIV
factor with COVID,

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
so I've been doing
a lot of research

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and looking everywhere
for everything.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.490 align:middle line:90%
In one article I read--

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.440 align:middle line:84%
it came through a
series of events--

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
had to do with a fellow at
a recent AIDS conference.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
in South America.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.550 align:middle line:84%
They found this one man who had
been HIV positive, who had it

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:84%
completely cleared
from the body using

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.640 align:middle line:84%
a radical technique with
niacinamide or nicotinamide.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Right.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: B3, and
a retrovirus drug.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Right.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.138 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now how
does that play into it?

00:27:01.138 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: I love that you
asked me this question,

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
but we probably need
another hour on it.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, geez.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Is there any like--

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Well, cytochrome
1, just so you know,

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:90%
what's the couple?

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:90%
It's NAD+ and NADH.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:90%
What makes that?

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Tryptophan.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Tryptophan is the
base of vitamin B3.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:84%
What do you need to
know about tryptophan?

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:90%
It's an aromatic amino acid.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.115 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean in English?

00:27:23.115 --> 00:27:25.075 align:middle line:90%
It gets programmed by sunlight.

00:27:25.075 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So are we?

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: So we're back.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're good to take a
little niacin or nicotinamide?

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: I tell my
people not to do that.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:31.885 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Don't do it.

00:27:31.885 --> 00:27:31.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: And the reason why,
the better answer is to allow

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.065 align:middle line:84%
your body to program
that naturally.

00:27:37.065 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Go
through that process.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: And the key really is
there when you understand truly

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:90%
when tryptophan is all about.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:43.965 align:middle line:84%
Not only does is
make melatonin--

00:27:43.965 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not just your dinner.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.292 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: No, it
makes melatonin,

00:27:46.292 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
but it also makes
serotonin in your body.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.270 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is if you're
not out getting it programmed,

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.860 align:middle line:84%
when you take a
supplement or you

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
eat too much turkey, which
I'm not a big fan of,

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.900 align:middle line:90%
you can create other problems.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the way our
system is designed to work

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:90%
is it's quantized.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
The amount of light
you get determines

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:90%
how that couple works.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out cytochrome
1, where NAD+ is,

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.040 align:middle line:84%
makes one of the key free
radicals in your body,

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:84%
which brings in the third leg of
the stool that I talk to people

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.340 align:middle line:90%
about, which is free radicals.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Why are free radicals a
big deal for your audience

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.270 align:middle line:90%
to understand?

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Because, remember, I told you.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:90%
It's light, water, magnetism.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.440 align:middle line:84%
What haven't we
talked about at all?

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Magnetism.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: The reason
why is free radicals.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I just read an
article on that yesterday.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Free radicals
have one unpaired electron.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has one
valence electron is magnetic.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.283 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: What's the other thing
that's magnetic in this whole

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:39.660 align:middle line:90%
dance that we're talking about?

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that oxygen is
the only paramagnetic gas

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.520 align:middle line:90%
on the periodic table?

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And what's the terminal electron
acceptor for mitochondria?

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:48.850 align:middle line:90%
What do we breathe?

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Oxygen.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.355 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: So what
does that mean?

00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Oxygen is drawn to things
that make magnetic fields.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So that spinning ATPase
that we talked about before,

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.820 align:middle line:90%
it makes a magnetic field.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:84%
How do you know what Jack is
telling you right now is true?

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:84%
We have these special
machines in hospitals

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:90%
called MEG machines.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Those are magnetoencephalograms.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:84%
We now know that the human
heart creates a magnetic field

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.940 align:middle line:90%
22 feet away.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, your and I's magnetic
field are interacting.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Our brain also has one.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that that is made
from the free radical signal

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.650 align:middle line:90%
that's made at cytochrome 1.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:90%
What's that free radical called?

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Superoxide.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:90%
And guess what.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Superoxide is made from oxygen
that's not used in metabolism.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So I just gave you a
really deep dive into this.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.420 align:middle line:90%
So now, OK, sunlight.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh, how about zinc?

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, should we do
zinc supplementation?

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:84%
You just mentioned
that a moment ago.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: If you have bad
mitochondrial function,

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.115 align:middle line:84%
if you have poor
readouts, I'd say yes.

00:29:53.115 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.495 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Or if you happen
to develop the symptoms,

00:29:55.495 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:84%
like say you lose
smell and taste, yeah,

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where you
actually start stepping

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:90%
on things.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: There's other
things out there to use.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Can you use nicotine?

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because it
turns out the spike--

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.925 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was going
to bring that up next.

00:30:05.925 --> 00:30:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: The spike
protein actually works with

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.413 align:middle line:90%
nicotine-related things.

00:30:10.413 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
things that we found out--

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That was one
of the quirky things.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Smokers weren't as--

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Right.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:90%
We found that in Italy.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.625 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Italy,
people were stunned.

00:30:17.625 --> 00:30:19.300 align:middle line:84%
They were like, wait, this
is a respiratory virus,

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.090 align:middle line:90%
but people who smoke--

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Smoke like crazy.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Didn't get it as bad.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because the
spike protein uses that.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.200 align:middle line:84%
There's some homology there in
the way the virus was built.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: So I tell people I
don't want you to go smoke,

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.780 align:middle line:90%
because it's going to affect--

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather you use
just nicotine gum.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: So you could
use nicotine gum to reduce

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:90%
your risk.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.960 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
you could do with zinc.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.597 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Another ionophore,
if you don't want to use

00:30:40.597 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
the antibiotic because you can't
get it because of the federal

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.890 align:middle line:90%
government, quercetin.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Quercetin is a supplement
that you can use.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It's usually found in
the skins of grapes.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
It's also found in
the skins of apples.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can buy
that on the market.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: You can
buy it on the market.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I thought it
was called "caresitin."

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.570 align:middle line:90%
It's called quercetin.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: That's like
tomato, "tomahto."

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: It's the same thing.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's the same
thing we're talking about.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Exactly.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:84%
The key is that's a zinc
ionophore that people

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.113 align:middle line:90%
can get their hands on.

00:31:06.113 --> 00:31:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I tell
my people about it

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:84%
is because
hydroxychloroquine has

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.925 align:middle line:90%
been so demonized in the media.

00:31:12.925 --> 00:31:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Just go to another
option, and you've got it.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So "caresitin"
or quercetin, right.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Either way.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin use,
because that comes in.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Controversial.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
my position on this

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.230 align:middle line:84%
is if you have an acute
infection, and say you're weak,

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:84%
say you have bad redox,
say you're diabetic,

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:84%
overweight, that's
the person that I

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
can get behind using the
melatonin to offset the risk.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:84%
If it was me, I
would never use it.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.740 align:middle line:84%
The reason why, when
you use exogenous

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.300 align:middle line:90%
melatonin, what does it do?

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
It reduces melatonin
production in your body.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.310 align:middle line:84%
What's the long-term
effect of using that?

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I have a biohack out there that
if you put my name in a Google

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.930 align:middle line:90%
box, biohack 722.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:53.950 align:middle line:90%
It thins your retina.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.417 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the big
reasons people get AMD.

00:31:56.417 --> 00:31:57.500 align:middle line:90%
So if you're going to do--

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: AMD?

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Acute
macular degeneration,

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:84%
which is another
blue light disease.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.055 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:32:02.055 --> 00:32:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Melatonin.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: What does blue
light destroy, Regina?

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Melatonin.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: What is
melatonin made from?

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Tryptophan.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we're back to
that story again.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: You see?

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm OK with melatonin use
if you have an acute infection.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want anybody
to watch this program

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and think that's a great idea
to use long-term with no risk,

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.730 align:middle line:84%
because the long-term use
of melatonin is a problem.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So many people
are using it just to sleep,

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.990 align:middle line:84%
especially women,
because women--

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Well, how about kids?

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They're the number ones because
they're addicted to technology.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Do you know
what the answer is?

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What?

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.590 align:middle line:90%
Pull the plug, or orange lights.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: No.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:36.655 align:middle line:90%
This is the answer.

00:32:36.655 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Orange glasses.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Because you
know what this does?

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: This preserves-- one
of the big benefits of wearing

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.680 align:middle line:84%
blue-blocking glasses
is it preserves DHA,

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.290 align:middle line:84%
which is fish oil in your
essential retinal pathways.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:49.910 align:middle line:84%
That's actually what creates
the melatonin in your eyes.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:84%
So guess what people
don't understand.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.775 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin is made
by AM sunlight.

00:32:54.775 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:90%
I bet you didn't know that.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I did.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.172 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: But it's the
hormone of darkness.

00:32:58.172 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It only acts to release
is electrons at night

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.355 align:middle line:84%
after your body temperature
falls 2 to 4 degrees.

00:33:04.355 --> 00:33:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This was
a really good idea.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: That's the
reason I brought it.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
You know why this is important
for me to explain to you

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.310 align:middle line:90%
while we're on camera?

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.018 align:middle line:84%
It's because by putting
these glasses on,

00:33:14.018 --> 00:33:16.227 align:middle line:84%
since you know we're around
all this blue light, what

00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I want you to understand is this
protects my free radical signal

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:84%
in these pathways so that
I'm going to be able to sleep

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:90%
tonight when I'm done with you.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're about done with me.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.400 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.008 align:middle line:84%
Jack, I just can't
thank you enough.

00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I said,
people are going

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to have to watch
this again and again.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I will as well, and
stop, look at, go ahead

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and do a little research on each
thing that you've said here.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:84%
But again, the story
sounds relatively simple.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.560 align:middle line:84%
We need to go back to
living how we were intended.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Well, the way we were
built. We were built to be--

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.050 align:middle line:90%
this is the real story of us.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:84%
We seem to think that we're
immune to the laws of evolution

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:90%
and the laws of nature.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize we're still
tied to it by the same fabric.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.820 align:middle line:84%
What I want people
to realize is what

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.525 align:middle line:84%
makes us special as mammals,
we have this thing in our head.

00:34:02.525 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Me as a neurosurgeon knows a lot
about this thing that allows us

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:90%
to break all of nature's laws.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
And you have to realize,
when you break them

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:84%
in innocuous ways, there's
biologic consequences for that.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:16.670 align:middle line:84%
The consequence that we talked
about today was why do certain

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.400 align:middle line:84%
people get C-19 and
other people's don't.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
the reason for that

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.870 align:middle line:84%
is because those people are
breaking more of nature's rules

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.130 align:middle line:90%
than they should.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%
That's really the
take-home story.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:30.139 align:middle line:84%
What I want them to understand
is how they can do things.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to the
doctor in their own head.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you know, maybe
that's the gift of COVID.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:84%
For the first time we've had
to dive down the rabbit hole

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.569 align:middle line:90%
en masse.

00:34:38.569 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Correct.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And start
understanding what the immune

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.694 align:middle line:84%
system is, how it functions,
and what it's asking of us.

00:34:42.694 --> 00:34:44.569 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: But what I
said to several people--

00:34:44.569 --> 00:34:46.277 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how
you feel about this,

00:34:46.277 --> 00:34:48.050 align:middle line:84%
but I'd be interested
in your feedback.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe that COVID-19
for me, in terms

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.139 align:middle line:84%
of how I teach mitochondrial
medicine, more people are going

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
to come to me now because
they're going to realize what's

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.180 align:middle line:84%
out there in conventional
wisdom, doctoring,

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:84%
hasn't had any huge
effect on their health.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
The answer for
them is a vaccine.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.038 align:middle line:84%
And we've spent an
hour here discussing

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:84%
how there's a lot of
different things we can do--

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: That actually improve
our mitochondrial health,

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.262 align:middle line:90%
and don't put us at risk.

00:35:13.262 --> 00:35:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, like I
said, I've signed up for you.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm totally on board
with what you're saying.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:21.427 align:middle line:84%
But I, too, spend too
much time indoors.

00:35:21.427 --> 00:35:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: We all do.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.468 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Outside of going--

00:35:23.468 --> 00:35:26.398 align:middle line:84%
doing my bicycle ride at
7:30/8 in the morning,

00:35:26.398 --> 00:35:28.190 align:middle line:84%
we all need to start
getting back in touch,

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as
you're out in the sun,

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:84%
you feel that
vitality in your body.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:84%
You feel more alive, and
then we forget about it.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.545 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: The last thing
I'm going to end on is this.

00:35:39.545 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.188 align:middle line:10%
>> KRUSE: The reason why we
are designed to be addicted

00:35:42.188 --> 00:35:44.480 align:middle line:10%
to the sun-- and this ties
to what I said to you before

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.730 align:middle line:10%
the interview, and I
hope this stays in.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.217 align:middle line:84%
That chemical POMC that I
told you about, P-O-M-C,

00:35:49.217 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:84%
do you know one of the
things that it makes?

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What?

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: It makes
an endogenous opiate.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.807 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Opiate.

00:35:54.807 --> 00:35:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: You've learned about
this opiate when it comes

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:57.890 align:middle line:90%
to exercise.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: Well, it turns out,
you know what stimulates it

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.010 align:middle line:90%
more than anything else?

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Sunlight.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As soon as
you're out in the sun,

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:90%
you feel so relaxed.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.323 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: That's beta endorphin.

00:36:05.323 --> 00:36:06.290 align:middle line:90%
So guess what happens.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.290 align:middle line:84%
People that don't
live that way, they

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:11.610 align:middle line:84%
tend to work at night, like
Michael Jackson, Chester

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Bennington.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: And what do they do?

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:90%
They use exogenous opiates.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So did I just tell
you that maybe there's

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
a link to the light that
we live under and maybe

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:90%
the opiate crisis that we have?

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.470 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I'm saying.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.655 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:36:26.655 --> 00:36:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: No problem.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.362 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now, where's
the best place to get a hold

00:36:29.362 --> 00:36:29.510 align:middle line:90%
of you?

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to tell people
go to your Patreon account.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.302 align:middle line:84%
Sign up so you can kind of
keep in connection with you.

00:36:34.302 --> 00:36:35.102 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: Yeah.

00:36:35.102 --> 00:36:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where would
you best have people go?

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.605 align:middle line:10%
>> KRUSE: Probably the
website, www.kruseatdestin.com.

00:36:40.605 --> 00:36:41.480 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: K-R-U-S-E.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:10%
>> KRUSE: Right.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:10%
And the Patreon blog, if you
just want to get a small flavor

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:10%
of Jack, it's www.patreon--

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where
I've been going.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Jack, again, thank you.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I think this has been
absolutely invaluable.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.950 align:middle line:90%
And I hope it's not only that.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I hope it has started building
a bridge between thinkers

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:07.405 align:middle line:84%
of all persuasions,
politically, and otherwise.

00:37:07.405 --> 00:37:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> KRUSE: It's always about
survival of the wisest.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It absolutely is.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:12.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to start using that.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll co-opt it.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> KRUSE: All righty.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As we just said,
you can find him on Patreon--

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.510 align:middle line:90%
at DrJackKruse-- .com.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.850 align:middle line:10%
