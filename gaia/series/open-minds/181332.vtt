00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: When
I was 17 or 18 years old,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:84%
my dad handed me a
copy of a book titled

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:84%
"Psycho-Cybernetics"
by Dr. Maxwell Maltz.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:90%
I never forgot its message.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
What shapes our
lives is a matter

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.470 align:middle line:84%
of our beliefs about ourselves
and the world around us.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.680 align:middle line:10%
After interviewing author Mitch
Horowitz about the genesis

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:10%
of the new thought movement
in his "Occult America" book,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:10%
he sent me a deluxe copy
of "Psycho-Cybernetics,"

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:10%
which was a direct energetic
lead into his new book,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.330 align:middle line:10%
"The Miracle Club."

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:10%
This wonderful
book takes us back

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:10%
to basics and the power of
the mind and our ability

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:10%
to create our functional
reality, grown up style.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the key
word, Mitch, is grown up style.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:84%
We have veered far away from
that in the last two or three

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:84%
intervening decades since
this kind of work came out.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Our series on your "Occult
America" book was just amazing.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loved it.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.078 align:middle line:90%
>> MITCH HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:01:11.078 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it really went
through the genesis of how this

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
movement came to be and how it
really started diffusing itself

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
into something that we
became akin to pap, really.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And people started hanging onto
that as the New Age wisdom.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:90%
But it was really insubstantial.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '60s
when he wrote this,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
that was actually a substantial
piece of work at the time--

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Napoleon Hill.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Substantial piece of work.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.938 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Very much.

00:01:36.938 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now we've been
hung up in the New Age movement

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:90%
for the last 30 years.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And people are finding
it's not working.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Why did it not necessarily
make us happier as a lot?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:10%
The positive mind
movement has been

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:10%
hugely successful at
communicating its message,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.950 align:middle line:10%
at creating a
popular literature,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:10%
at influencing different
reaches of the culture.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
What Joel Osteen does every
Sunday morning from his pulpit,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.174 align:middle line:84%
it comes right out
of this material.

00:02:06.174 --> 00:02:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: And that's
true throughout much

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:90%
of the evangelical world.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
It's true throughout much
of the New Age world.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:10%
But the movement stopped
examining itself.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:10%
It got caught up into
a kind of catechism.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:10%
It got caught up into
sloganeering and refrigerator

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:10%
magnets.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:10%
And all of that is
important in so far

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:10%
as you have to
disseminate your message.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
But you can't stop growing.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can't lapse
into childish language.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I was driving past a church in
upstate New York the other day,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and the marquee
sign out front said,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
pessimists need a
kick in the cans.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK, that's cute.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:90%
But we got to go further.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.287 align:middle line:90%
We got to go further.

00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the insights of
the positive mind movement.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:90%
It's my life.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm dedicated to it.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But the movement has
slipped into very often

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:84%
a childish language, a
pep rally atmosphere,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:90%
and it's not a nursery school.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:90%
We're here to search.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:90%
We're here to grow.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We also have to acknowledge
the movement's limitations.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:90%
We have to talk about--

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why--

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: --when
things go wrong.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.475 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --when things go
wrong and why it doesn't work

00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:17.014 align:middle line:90%
sometimes or a lot of the time.

00:03:17.014 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: My contention--

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I very rarely use the
term law of attraction

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:84%
because I think
that term has come

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
to mean one mental super
law that defines everything.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:10%
It may very well be--
and I believe it's true--

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:10%
that consciousness or awareness
is the ultimate arbiter

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:10%
of life.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:84%
But we do live within
a cosmic framework

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
where we experience
lots of laws and forces,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.884 align:middle line:84%
including physical decline,
including mortality.

00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
There's never been
an exception to that.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Including time.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Including time.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And the positive mind
movement, the law

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.127 align:middle line:90%
of attraction movement--

00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I love "The Secret."

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:90%
I love Rhonda Byrne.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.750 align:middle line:10%
But it has not met
people where they

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:10%
live in all facets of life.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
We need a theology of suffering
because people are dealing

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.090 align:middle line:84%
with end of life issues
now that didn't actually

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
exist quite in the
same way 100 years ago.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: How so?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.493 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Well,
people are living longer.

00:04:11.493 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:84%
There are diseases that
would have taken a person's

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:90%
life within weeks in 1900.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
But here in the 21st century,
they might live for years.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And they might not have
the quality of life

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:90%
that one hopes for.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And the positive
mind movement has

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
to be able to respond and say,
even if life is half a loaf,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
even if it is half a
loaf, that half a loaf

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:84%
can be consumed with dignity and
generativity and gratefulness

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:90%
and verve.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And we can stand
fully erect, even when

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:90%
life gives us half a loaf.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
We can't say all the
time half a loaf is

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
a full loaf because it doesn't
meet people where they live.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:90%
The movement is real.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are causative.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But we live under
many laws and forces.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:10%
And the movement needs to
take that into account.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why do you think
we simply stopped the process

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:90%
of inquiry?

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, OK, so let me
just say and to add

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:90%
to what you said a moment ago.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Bumper stickers,
refrigerator magnets,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:84%
little sticky notes
on the mirror.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Another one-- and
I like his work--

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Martin Boroson did a little
book called "The One Minute

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Meditation" or something.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It's great for people who
don't know how to sit still.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful start to say, it
doesn't matter how much time.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.917 align:middle line:84%
Just give yourself a little bit
of time even to jump into it.

00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But, again, this
whole thing about you

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.910 align:middle line:84%
don't need to invest a lot of
anything to make it all happen,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:90%
including inquiry.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: I think that
the new thought movement,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
the positive mind movement
stopped growing when

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:84%
the philosopher William
James died in 1910.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:90%
He really is my hero.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I'm attempting

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to do in "The Miracle Club" is
reignite the spirit of inquiry

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:90%
that he brought to this.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:84%
He was a believer in everything
that we're talking about,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:84%
but he was also a
great experimenter.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And he was also
willing to be wrong.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was also willing to
bring critical sympathy.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
After he died, I think that that
spirit of intellectual inquiry

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:90%
began to wither.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.297 align:middle line:84%
And people had great
successes with books

00:06:11.297 --> 00:06:12.880 align:middle line:84%
like "The Power of
Positive Thinking,"

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Norman Vincent Peale's classic.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And the movement was so
successful at reaching

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:84%
a mass audience that that
itself became the focus.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:84%
That itself became
the focus, not

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
saying where have we gone
wrong, and not saying

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:90%
why should any of this work?

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
What is the theory
of positive thinking?

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I try to come up with
a theory in the book.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And we always have to be
pushing those boundaries.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to say,
well, we have testimony.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:84%
We do have testimony,
and testimony matters.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
But with all these things, ESP,
channeling, positive thinking,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:90%
we have to reach for a theory.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:90%
We have to push ourselves.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The title
itself, "The Miracle Club,"

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.442 align:middle line:90%
and people think, oh, a miracle.

00:06:56.442 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Something's going to be
delivered quickly and easily.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what I like.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Everybody likes a miracle.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Everybody
likes a miracle.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.300 align:middle line:84%
That should be the title
of sequel actually.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everybody likes a--
yes, it should be actually.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: I'm
going to use that.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Take it.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So in "Miracle Club,"
it was actually

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
fashioned after an occult
salon from the late 1800s.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
the original Miracle

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.117 align:middle line:90%
Club was about.

00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And for starters,
I defined a miracle

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.560 align:middle line:84%
as anything that is a
fortuitous, radical departure

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.746 align:middle line:90%
from all expected circumstance.

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:27.870 align:middle line:90%
And these things do happen.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.828 align:middle line:90%
These things do happen.

00:07:28.828 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:10%
So I don't shy away
from using the word.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:10%
The Miracle Club was a
group of occult seekers

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.090 align:middle line:10%
who got together in a
cramped, little apartment

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:10%
on the west side of
Manhattan in 1875.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And their dedication
was to explore

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
mediumship and seances
and mental healing

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and things that go
bump in the night.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were together
only a very short time.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Then they drifted apart.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:10%
But the nucleus of that group,
the Miracle Club, got together,

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:10%
and they formed a much
larger and more influential

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:10%
group called the
Theosophical Society.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:10%
And it, of course, was our
beloved Madam HP Blavatsky

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:10%
and Colonel Henry Steele Olcott.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
They were the original
members of the Miracle Club.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.980 align:middle line:10%
And then they formed the
Theosophical Society,

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:10%
which, of course,
went on to create

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:10%
a revolution in alternative
spirituality around the world.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:10%
But I wanted to get back to
the informality and the spirit

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:10%
of experimentation that animated
the original Miracle Club.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So the book is named
after that group of folks.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:90%
They had a motto.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.285 align:middle line:84%
It was one word, try,
with an exclamation point.

00:08:34.285 --> 00:08:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Try.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To me, that is the
best motto you could have.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:10%
Just put that one
up on your mirror,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:10%
and you've got it covered.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: That's it.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Just give it a try.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Try.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: See what happens.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:42.979 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Try.

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: And they received--
later on, Madam Blavatsky would

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
talk about receiving these
phenomenally produced letters

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:90%
from hidden masters.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:10%
The Miracle Club
received one such letter.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:10%
And it was addressed
to Colonel Olcott.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:84%
It said, do not
give up thy club.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Try, exclamation point.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that's it.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:90%
We're not giving up.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And here we are, well
over a century later.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Century and a half.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Century and a half.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
We're starting the
Miracle Club again.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's a member.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:10%
All you have to
want to do is try.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:10%
And you're in.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: You're in.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
I'm asking next--

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and you've got it right
there on your left--

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of dyslexic--
your left bicep.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Neville.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about Neville Goddard
and what he means to you,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:90%
why you respect him so and why.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.270 align:middle line:84%
He's really foundational
to your work.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Introduce people to his life.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: Sure.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:10%
Neville Goddard was a
British-Barbadian mystic

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:10%
who lived and worked primarily
here in the US in New York

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:10%
and California.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:90%
He died in 1972.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:90%
And he had one basic teaching.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is, your imagination
is God, and everything

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:84%
that you see here and
experience is self-created,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:84%
including my own voice,
including my presence and image

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I am rooted in
you, the listener,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:84%
as you are ultimately
rooted in God.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:90%
There's no Mitch, in effect.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Mitch is a figment of your
own mental visualization.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:10%
And I'm here just because
this thought is now

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:10%
ready to be disclosed to you.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:10%
And Neville taught that
the god of scripture,

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:10%
Old and New Testament,
is a metaphor

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:10%
for the human imagination
and that your mental pictures

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:10%
and your emotively
charged thoughts

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:10%
generate everything
that you experience.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:10%
And he was able
to articulate this

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:10%
over the course of
thousands of lectures,

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:10%
more than 10 books,
with such freshness

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:10%
and such verve and such life.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of thesis
one immediately

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:84%
wants to argue with
because people think, well,

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.644 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I just got in a traffic
accident this morning.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me
I created that?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:90%
People want to push back.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But Neville could
explain these things

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.060 align:middle line:84%
with such elegance
and such simplicity.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things he said--
and I found this to be true,

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:84%
frankly, across the
experience of my own life--

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:90%
he said, we are very forgetful.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:84%
We will have thoughts and
ideas and mental pictures,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and there will necessarily
be an interval of time

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
that occurs between the
thought and the event.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.610 align:middle line:10%
A human life takes
nine months to gestate.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
How much more might
a thought take?

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.577 align:middle line:84%
And I have found that there
is a remarkable congruency

00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
between things that
I may have thought

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:84%
about maybe a decade
ago and things

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.284 align:middle line:90%
that are happening right now.

00:11:28.284 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: And that
congruency sometimes is so vivid

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:90%
and so tactile--

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.020 align:middle line:90%
it's extraordinary.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:34.820 align:middle line:90%
But we forget.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:90%
We're forgetful.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We do forget.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, and, again, this is
something I talk about a lot,

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.350 align:middle line:90%
even in the workshops I do.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I mention the fact that time
is the enemy of creativity.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: That's
beautifully put.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
it's for all of us.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:10%
It's the greatest
frustration of being

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.490 align:middle line:10%
human because we have these
beautiful thoughts and ideas.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:10%
And if only we were in a
timeless kind of structure

00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:10%
truly--

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:10%
I mean, in this
dimension functionally--

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:10%
and could manifest things
at a more rapid speed.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you even imagine what
this planet would be like

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
if people were able to
manifest their brilliant ideas

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.009 align:middle line:90%
and their best of intentions?

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:14.716 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you got to
offset it with what

00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:90%
can happen on the other side.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.495 align:middle line:90%
Manifestation both ways.

00:12:17.495 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Exactly right.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.619 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is
the dance that's so hard,

00:12:20.619 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
as he said that this notion
that you knew what you want.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:90%
You felt it.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.680 align:middle line:90%
You tasted it.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.609 align:middle line:90%
And then time passed.

00:12:27.609 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you forget about
it, and you compromise.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:90%
And you go on with your life.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.252 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
There's the expression, careful
what you wish for, you just

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.614 align:middle line:90%
might get it.

00:12:36.614 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
go through in the book

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:84%
is, best as I can tell,
best as I can tell,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
that expression began with
the philosopher Goethe.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:90%
But it was different.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:10%
What Goethe wrote was what you
wish for when you are young

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:10%
will come upon you in
waves when you are old.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.575 align:middle line:90%
So be careful.

00:12:53.575 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Be careful, yes.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: That's
the gestation.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, people
might hear that

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I
don't agree with that.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm experiencing
all kinds of things

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:10%
that don't conform to what I
wished for when I was young.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Goethe's challenge would
be, are you sure about that?

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.379 align:middle line:90%
Take a second look at that.

00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Take a second look
at that because we

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
have all kinds of thoughts,
some of which are destructive,

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.875 align:middle line:84%
some of which are magnificent,
some of which are petty,

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:84%
some of which are generous,
some of which are epic,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:90%
some of which are small.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:10%
But that was his contention
that we are really

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:10%
wind up in a place
where we began,

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.184 align:middle line:10%
so be careful was his warning.

00:13:23.184 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Be careful.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed
this in my own life.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think of one
example in particular

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
where I just kind of let
life show itself to me

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:90%
and then follow those threads.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:90%
That's how I tend to live.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.090 align:middle line:10%
And this was just
a feeling I had

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:10%
watching this movie,
a foreign film called

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:10%
"A Man and a Woman."

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:90%
And this was a '60s film.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And the woman in
it was a director.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.122 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, could a
woman be a movie director?

00:13:46.122 --> 00:13:47.621 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Isn't
that interesting?

00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that
even possibly?

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Because my world view
was I didn't think

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.147 align:middle line:90%
that was even conceivable.

00:13:53.147 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And I just thought--

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I'd looked at her, and
she was out in nature

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and had this big,
white car coat on.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
It was called a car
coat in the day.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And she was having her crew
get the shot she wanted.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It was so dreamy,
the notion of it.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And then, boom.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Many years later, I'm
shooting a documentary.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I have my crew
with me-- for PBS.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:90%
I have my crew with me.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm up on a mountain top.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's snowing.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:90%
I have this big coat on.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- and I'm
directing everything,

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:90%
of course, it was my show--

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, my god, I never
ever gave that original thought

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:90%
a second thought.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And life just led
to this moment.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Isn't
that interesting?

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.798 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But the
juice was there.

00:14:34.798 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:90%
The desire was there.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was 25,
20, 30 years later

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:90%
before it actually manifested.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Isn't
that interesting?

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that-- and it would
be very easy to forget that.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's so literal.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.249 align:middle line:84%
I just happened to
notice it standing

00:14:47.249 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and the movie flashed
in front of me.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And this happens, like you
say, if you start looking,

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.664 align:middle line:84%
really look, where has this
taken seed before in your life?

00:14:55.664 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And this gets onto
something else with Goddard

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is that he said,
once you have imagined this,

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:90%
you now have an existing thing.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter then of choosing
it, selecting it, and selecting

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
it again and again until
you can get to enough time,

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:84%
however much time it
takes to manifest, right?

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Explain what he meant by that.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Well, I'm
glad brought that up.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:10%
I actually don't use the
term manifest myself.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:10%
I use the term select.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Create, select, OK.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: Because
my contention is--

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:10%
and this is one of the things
I develop in the book--

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:10%
that we live within
an infinitude.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Everything is happening
at once, so to speak.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.500 align:middle line:10%
And I think we have evidence
of that over the past 80 years,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:10%
coming out of both
quantum theory

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:10%
and serious psychical research.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:10%
There are things happening
in a kind of wave stage,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.990 align:middle line:10%
so to speak.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:10%
Things are in superposition.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:54.070 align:middle line:10%
And what we focus
on is, in actuality,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:10%
an act of measurement,
not entirely different

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:10%
from what a sensate
observer does

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:10%
in a laboratory setting
in the psychical lab

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.597 align:middle line:10%
or in the particle lab.

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:90%
There is a selection made.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.250 align:middle line:84%
There's something
going on, almost as

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
if we're drawing a matrix grid,
isolates a moment in time.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But it would be impossible for
us to live in the framework

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that we occupy if we
experience that all the time.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:90%
So we experience linearity.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
linearity is actually

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.370 align:middle line:84%
real as an ultimate,
defining concept.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.896 align:middle line:84%
But it's enormously powerful,
and it's enormously necessary.

00:16:30.896 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
a great illusion.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: It's a great
illusion and a necessary one.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have to be here
with you at a certain time.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to conclude our
discussion at a certain time.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:10%
But I do believe that through
the process of selectivity,

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:10%
our emotionalized
thoughts, what we focus on,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:10%
our perspective,
our mental pictures,

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:10%
we are isolating things
that become our experience.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:90%
And we have memories.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:90%
We have recollections.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:10%
How do we know those memories
and recollections weren't

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:10%
selected at this very instant?

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.324 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, part
of the process,

00:17:04.324 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:90%
you have to keep re-selecting.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.119 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: You have
to keep re-selecting.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:90%
It's the burden of being human.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the burden of
human creativity.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:84%
And we feel these things-- past,
present, projected future--

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:90%
in such a vivid way.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:84%
These things seem as
real to us as this table

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.550 align:middle line:90%
that we're sitting at.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.359 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this isn't what happens
in terms of particle mechanics,

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:90%
as many people have observed.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:84%
You have particles affecting
one another from vast distances,

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.080 align:middle line:90%
across time, across space.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:90%
We know that time slows down.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The theory of relativity
has being proven.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.300 align:middle line:10%
We have a tremendous
amount of quality research

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.190 align:middle line:10%
that's been done in
precognition by people

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:10%
like Dean Radin and
Daryl Bem and JB

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:10%
and Louisa Rhine, two
of my great heroes.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:10%
So we know that time
and objects do not

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:10%
behave as they're supposed to.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:10%
And the question
is, why does it seem

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:10%
like they behave so ordinarily
in our day to day experience?

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.002 align:middle line:90%
A table's a table.

00:17:59.002 --> 00:18:00.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
infinite tables here.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:90%
We have one.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But someone
created this table.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.683 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Someone created it.

00:18:03.683 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle line:10%
Time is time.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.380 align:middle line:84%
It marches on in a linear
fashion like a river.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:84%
It may be-- it may be
that we are experiencing

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:84%
a kind of information
leakage when

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
we use coarser instruments
like our own five senses

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:90%
to measure reality.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the
particle lab, for example,

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
you're using these exquisitely
finely tuned instruments.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But almost like
you're panning back

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:84%
a camera, when you're going
through your day to day life

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:84%
in traffic, catching a
bus, whatever you're doing,

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
the instruments that
you're using are coarser.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And you see less and less
of what's actually going on.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what's
going on is so subtle.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it's difficult
to even articulate.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:51.490 align:middle line:84%
If our reality, our creation,
starts with a thought,

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:84%
it's probably accompanied by a
feeling, which is accompanied

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:90%
by ultimately an emotion.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And then it's accompanied by
a historical context for what

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.049 align:middle line:90%
we believe is possible.

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:03.923 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: For what
we believe is possible.

00:19:03.923 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so you add
these things together.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're constantly feeding
this very delicate matrix

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
with pixels of new
information all the time.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:10%
And, I mean, when he's saying
that this is your creation,

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:10%
there are no two
creations that are alike

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:10%
in terms of human perception
of life and experience.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.810 align:middle line:10%
It's impossible because
every tiny bit of you

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:10%
is impregnating the thing that
is becoming your next moment.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes, including
a past, a present,

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.780 align:middle line:90%
a projected future.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.621 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: And, again--

00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Cultural dynamics,
bought into belief systems.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:43.150 align:middle line:10%
We have to allow for
the fact that we're

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:10%
living within a network
of infinite possibilities.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.690 align:middle line:84%
We see this happening
in the particle lab

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
itself where if a subatomic
particle is in a wave

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:84%
state and is in a
state of superposition.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody makes a
decision to take a measurement

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
or not take a measurement
or let's do it after lunch,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:90%
they are creating--

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:05.275 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're creating--

00:20:05.275 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: --a
past present, future.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: It's mind blowing.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's contrary to everything
we were raised to believe.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're
much more powerful

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
as thinkers as those who measure
than we've come to understand.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole other
element on top of that even,

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:90%
and that is the nature of will.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:10%
There are people who have very
clear focus, very strong minds,

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:10%
clear will.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And it has a kind
of amplitude to it.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:84%
They can, even if
it's desirable or not,

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:84%
push things into
existence, so to speak.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Or others have kind of a softer
way of engaging with reality

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:90%
and engaging with possibility.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And will has a
lot to do with it.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:84%
But you can kind of almost
over-project something.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.616 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
what you're saying.

00:20:58.616 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Some people criticize
me for over-projecting.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:10%
They feel I ride the
brake a little too much.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:10%
I understand where
they're coming from.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
There is a division of
sorts within our alternative

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:90%
spiritual culture.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people take what might
be called a more zen approach

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and say, just let
what will be be.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Let life just come to you.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Drift.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.121 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that the true
nature of things?

00:21:23.121 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that the
nature of the tao.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.720 align:middle line:10%
And I honor that.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:90%
I honor that.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But my contention-- and I
read about this in the book,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and, for some, this is
very controversial--

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:84%
my contention is that
the Western seeker--

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I use the West as an example
because it's what I know--

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
the Western seeker
is never going

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:84%
to be truly happy unless
he or she is moving

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of some
kind of self-attainment,

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:90%
self-expression.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:84%
The artist wants to
create, wants an audience.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.790 align:middle line:84%
The financier wants to be
generative and productive.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:10%
The teacher wants the student
to be receptive to what

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.840 align:middle line:10%
he or she is saying.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:90%
I truly believe in my heart.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I honor concepts
of non-attachment

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:90%
and non-identification.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:10%
But I have to say, in all
honesty, that's not my path.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:90%
That's not--

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
That's not the path of
the West in general.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:11.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it isn't.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.519 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: And I do
believe in striving.

00:22:13.519 --> 00:22:15.320 align:middle line:90%
I do believe in attainment.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:10%
And I do believe that
if we are created

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:10%
in the image of
the higher, if we

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.460 align:middle line:10%
are made in the
image of the creator,

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:10%
it stands to reason that we
are here to be productive.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:90%
We are here to be generative.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people to embrace
that side of themselves.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I do too.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, it's the
delicacy of the dance in terms

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:84%
of how hard you're on the
brake versus the accelerator.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:41.920 align:middle line:90%
There's always that dance.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:10%
Everyone's different in
the way they function.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
what I'm hearing you

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
say is if you're looking
at it in more of a zen way,

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:90%
you're actually not listening.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:10%
If you're just saying, just
blow me where you want me to go,

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:10%
you're leaving that
up to external forces.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.800 align:middle line:10%
And that is not your
life's creation.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:90%
If you're listening--

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, listening-- you're
a teacher because that's

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:90%
your Dharma.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're a
teacher to begin with.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.434 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, you
want to do your best.

00:23:09.434 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're an artist, you
want to do your best.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:90%
You're putting yourself out.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.040 align:middle line:84%
But you've already listened
to the internal voice that's

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:90%
guiding you.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's the passive part is
to be still long enough to hear

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.580 align:middle line:84%
the voice and to know
what your passion

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and what your heart's
saying, right?

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then you
can apply everything.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And we do that so rarely.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:10%
We repeat to ourselves
internally things

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.721 align:middle line:10%
that we think we're
supposed to want

00:23:33.721 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:10%
or that we think are
going to make us look

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:10%
good in the eyes of others.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:10%
I like my job.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I like my colleagues.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:90%
I want to get married.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.251 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Do you really?

00:23:43.251 --> 00:23:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Be very careful.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:10%
I mean, sometimes people say
they want such and such job.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Whereas what they
really want is security,

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:90%
which is another thing.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And the condition security
to look like this job.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
My encouragement
is to really take

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:84%
a sustained and mature and
intimate and very private

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:90%
measurement--

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And inventory.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: --of what
you want-- and inventory.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And don't talk to
anybody about it

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.340 align:middle line:84%
because they may condition
what you're saying.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:90%
They may run it down.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.280 align:middle line:90%
This is your private experiment.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:84%
This is part of being a
member of the Miracle Club.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:10%
You could sit down with a
private piece of paper, pencil,

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:10%
not talking to anybody
and really ask yourself,

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:10%
what do I want?

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And you might be shocked
because sometimes somebody

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:84%
who thinks of themselves as
spiritual, so to speak, really

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:90%
wants material success.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Vice versa, a
corporate go-getter

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:84%
might just want to stay
at home and mellow out

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of his or her life.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it may be, it's
almost always shocking

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
when you really take a
sustained internal inventory

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.654 align:middle line:90%
or measurement.

00:24:47.654 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You never know what's
going to be there.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
probably number one.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's the first
part of the journey

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:84%
right there, doing
that private little.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: I do believe it is.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I do believe it is.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.280 align:middle line:10%
My wish is that if
people take away

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:10%
one thing only from
positive mind philosophy,

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:10%
take away the importance
of having a definite aim,

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.245 align:middle line:10%
a passionate, central aim.

00:25:09.245 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:10%
And, again, it's
something people

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:10%
want to argue with because
our lives are complex.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
are apt to say--

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm apt to say--

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:84%
look, I need all
kinds of things.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:10%
But I think life brokers
kind of bargain with us.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.750 align:middle line:10%
And that bargain is
that you get what

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:10%
you want with all your heart.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And before pushing back
against that, try it.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Put me to the test.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Put me to the test.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And I won't revoke
anybody's membership card

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:90%
in the Miracle Club.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%
This is your experiment.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.230 align:middle line:10%
Put me to the test.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.720 align:middle line:84%
The active focus
and the energies

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that are summoned from within
a person when he or she settles

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:84%
upon one passionately held
aim, they can be extraordinary.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.495 align:middle line:84%
It can be a game changer
for the rest of your life.

00:25:52.495 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It can be.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think, at
the same time, we

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:84%
have to get out of this kind
of culture of celebrity,

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:84%
when people think
that you have to be

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:84%
famous for what you're doing,
you have to be the only one.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And the comparison
part doesn't work well

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
in this creative process because
that's not being true to self.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing I
love, I'm passionate at,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.190 align:middle line:90%
and I want to do my best.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And stop trying to draw
parallels or overinflate

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:84%
what you think your outcome
realistically should be.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I would add this
one wrinkle to it.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I was watching a documentary
on HBO about Elvis Presley,

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and Bruce Springsteen
was narrating it.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, probably revealing
something about himself,

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.250 align:middle line:84%
he said, there came a
point in Elvis's career

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:84%
where the man you saw on stage
was actually the real guy.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was at home
and in private

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:90%
that he had trouble fitting in.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And I listened to that,
and I thought, so what?

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:84%
If that was the real Elvis,
let him be the man on stage

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:90%
in the jumpsuit.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:90%
People loved him.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.909 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I understand things
are difficult at home.

00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But that might be
the part of him that really came

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Exactly.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He came to
express that thing.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.650 align:middle line:90%
That is the real him.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: That's
the real him.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:10%
And I write in the
book, I've never quite

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:10%
trusted that expression that
nobody on their deathbed

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.780 align:middle line:10%
wishes they spent more
time at the office.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure that's true.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
The office, the studio,
the martial arts studio,

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:90%
the writing desk.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:10%
It may be that that's really
who you are, and that's fine.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.797 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, you have to
maintain relationships.

00:27:30.797 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:10%
If you don't give proper
attention to your family,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:10%
to your relationships,
these things

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:10%
will eventually take
all your attention.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.100 align:middle line:10%
But the fact is, somebody who
gets classified as a workaholic

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:10%
or whatever, I don't know that
that's fair to that person.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:84%
That may be who that person
is, just like Elvis on stage.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.749 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is true.

00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:49.240 align:middle line:90%
That is not fair to judge that.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking about
how do you really want--

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:52.471 align:middle line:90%
I want to have a family.

00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:53.386 align:middle line:90%
I want to get married.

00:27:53.386 --> 00:27:54.330 align:middle line:90%
I want to have kids.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:58.500 align:middle line:84%
I just flashed back to a day,
and I remember it so clearly.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:90%
It was New Year's Eve.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was with a
group of people,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and this one couple
couldn't conceive.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, they were a fun couple.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.600 align:middle line:84%
They had ventured and
traveled together.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And they were great as
a twosome, as partners.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:84%
They enjoyed their life doing
the things they enjoyed doing.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So they said, my wish
for New Year's Eve,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.380 align:middle line:84%
this New Year's Eve, is
that we can have a baby.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, fair
enough, I'll remember that.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:10%
Pop the champagne cork, went
through in vitro fertilization,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:10%
went through the whole
process, and took a while.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Finally got pregnant--
it took a long time.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.461 align:middle line:90%
The body wasn't willing.

00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:32.460 align:middle line:90%
Pushed it and pushed it.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.260 align:middle line:90%
The baby comes into the world.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:84%
They're not great
together as parents.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.040 align:middle line:90%
They were good friends.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:90%
And they were good partners.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: That's fascinating.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.858 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when
the child came,

00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:84%
the relationship almost
immediately fell apart.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Ended very acrimoniously.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:84%
The child really
suffered the brunt of it.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And as all the years went
on, I kept flashing back

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:90%
to the popping of that cork.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Isn't
that fascinating?

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.432 align:middle line:90%
It's what Goethe said.

00:28:57.432 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:84%
What you wish for
when you're young

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:84%
will come upon you in
waves, so be careful.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.536 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Be careful.

00:29:02.536 --> 00:29:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Be careful.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in your book, you
have a theory of why positive

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:07.670 align:middle line:90%
thinking works.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.641 align:middle line:84%
That sounds really
simple and basic,

00:29:09.641 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
but let's explain
that before we get

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.030 align:middle line:90%
into the rest the discussion.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:12.865 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Sure.

00:29:12.865 --> 00:29:15.695 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's foundational
to the discussion.

00:29:15.695 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: It was something
that I was alluding to earlier,

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:10%
which is that we live
within an infinitude.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:10%
And we are actually able,
through the measurement

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.370 align:middle line:10%
of our thoughts, perceptions,
emotions, mental pictures,

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:10%
to create a kind of matrix
grid where we isolate things.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.020 align:middle line:10%
We isolate things.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.320 align:middle line:10%
And they feel as
tactilly real to us

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.970 align:middle line:10%
as the floorboards
beneath our feet,

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:40.390 align:middle line:10%
but we are actually selecting.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:10%
And we get glimpses
of this sometimes.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:10%
In the book, I write about
the idea of a time collapse

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.691 align:middle line:10%
where there are times--

00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:10%
and I give three examples
from my own life in the book

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.680 align:middle line:10%
and very intimate examples--

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.030 align:middle line:10%
there are times where
people suddenly experience

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.470 align:middle line:10%
this sense of infinitude.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:10%
It's much more than deja vu.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.650 align:middle line:10%
It's a sense not only
that I've been here before

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:10%
but that everything that
my life is composed of

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.150 align:middle line:10%
is present, is in front of
me, is happening all at once,

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:10%
as if I were the highest
source of creation

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.210 align:middle line:10%
looking at life like some
kind of a comic strip.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And I could see past,
present, future.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And this comic strip
was multi-dimensional

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.480 align:middle line:90%
and was everywhere.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:90%
I've had three such experiences.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.670 align:middle line:10%
Probably you have
and your viewers can

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:10%
think of experiences
where they have suddenly

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:10%
felt like everything
stopped, and, yet,

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.310 align:middle line:10%
everything was present
and apparent to them.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:90%
We're not without perspective.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.360 align:middle line:90%
We're not without perspective.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.430 align:middle line:84%
We lose perspective
because we get so sucked

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:90%
into events and sensations.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you have those
time collapse experiences,

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:84%
you're experiencing
life in its infinitude.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
You're cleansing the doors
of perception, so to speak,

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and seeing yourself as
you really are infinite.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
speak of selecting

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:90%
rather than manifesting.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
doing it all the time.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.810 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
can we direct it?

00:30:58.810 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Can we direct it?

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.021 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to William James.

00:31:02.021 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:10%
You talked about him early on.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.940 align:middle line:10%
Why is he your hero?

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.740 align:middle line:10%
Where is he?

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:10%
Is he on your body somewhere?

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: You know, he's not.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.541 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I have to take care that.

00:31:08.541 --> 00:31:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I have Buddy Holly.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I have Neville,
Archangel Gabriel.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Maybe my back I'll get James.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: William James.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I want to see his portrait
next time on your back.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:18.911 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: It's a deal.

00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a deal.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:84%
This is why he's my hero
because William James was always

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.700 align:middle line:90%
willing to deepen the question.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was a Harvard-educated
philosopher and M.D.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:10%
And he would always
say to his colleagues,

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:10%
you haven't spent so
much as an afternoon

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.890 align:middle line:10%
researching the benefits
of homeopathy, for example,

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.950 align:middle line:10%
and, yet, you have this cut
and dried opinion about it.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:10%
You haven't spent so much
as an afternoon attempting

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:48.100 align:middle line:10%
to experiment with
Christian Science methods,

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.130 align:middle line:10%
and you have this cut and
dried attitude about it.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.780 align:middle line:90%
This is anti-intellectualism.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
James encouraged us to
always deepen the question.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And he believed in the
vitality of testimony.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.360 align:middle line:10%
He believed that if enough
people described an experience

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:10%
over the course of a certain
period of time or generations,

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.100 align:middle line:10%
that's a record.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's vitally important.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear scientists today,
as they did in James's era,

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:19.030 align:middle line:84%
dismiss anecdote, personal
stories, individual accounts.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:90%
These things are testimony.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Testimony becomes
a record over time.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, we're
always using testimony.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we know
about SSRIs, for example,

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.400 align:middle line:90%
comes from testimony.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we know
about pain management

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.790 align:middle line:90%
comes from testimony.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:10%
To this day, we've been
prescribing SSRIs for decades.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:10%
No one has any
idea how they work.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:10%
We don't even understand
the so-called side effects.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:84%
We call them side
effects because we

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.320 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.470 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a
spray of needles,

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and these needles strike
different points in us.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And they cause different
things to happen.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand why,
but we ask the subject,

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.130 align:middle line:84%
we ask the patient,
how are you feeling?

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.170 align:middle line:90%
What is that but testimony?

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So a great deal of our
science stands on testimony.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And James was heroic
in saying, you

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.750 align:middle line:84%
must never dismiss
the experience

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.990 align:middle line:84%
of the individual eye
witness or seeker.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.970 align:middle line:10%
The other day, I was
talking to a reporter

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.880 align:middle line:10%
from the "Atlantic Monthly"
about demonic possession.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:10%
And he was asking
me, what's going on?

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.550 align:middle line:10%
What's happening?

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.200 align:middle line:10%
And naturally, being a
mainstream journalist,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.006 align:middle line:10%
he's expecting me to say, well,
sociologically and economically

00:33:25.006 --> 00:33:25.880 align:middle line:10%
and blah, blah, blah.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.320 align:middle line:90%
And all that may be true.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But I said to him, never, never,
never discount the experience

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:90%
of the individual.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.990 align:middle line:84%
If somebody says they've seen
a flying saucer, if somebody

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:84%
tells you a story about
a ghost or possession,

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:40.630 align:middle line:84%
you must never, never
discount the fact

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that that person is reporting
to you something that's

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:90%
empirically completely accurate.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.700 align:middle line:10%
You can bring in other things,
and they may not be accurate.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you dismiss
that out of hand,

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.380 align:middle line:84%
then you're removing
testimony from the picture.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was James's
greatness as a philosopher.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.300 align:middle line:84%
He deeply respected
the individual

00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.622 align:middle line:90%
and his or her experiences.

00:33:59.622 --> 00:34:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what is it that
happens to us and especially

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.180 align:middle line:90%
in a time like this?

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's not as though we
haven't had other times

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.650 align:middle line:90%
of great social division.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is one of them.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Of course,
every generation does.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But what is it in us that,
especially in times like this,

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:84%
are actually afraid to
investigate the unfamiliar?

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Isn't
that fascinating?

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:26.159 align:middle line:84%
I know that among the
many critics I deal with,

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:29.730 align:middle line:84%
they are afraid that if people
investigate the very things

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:31.650 align:middle line:84%
that you and I
are talking about,

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:84%
it will unleash this wave of
irrationalism in the world.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And people will be
saying, wow, I'm infinite.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.679 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to go to work.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:10%
And everything that happens
to me is self-created.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:90%
And they're worried.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:48.180 align:middle line:84%
They're frightened of this
wave of irrationalism.

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
what they're saying.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:51.679 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I get frightened too.

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.420 align:middle line:10%
I do my things to
hold my life together.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I put my coffee cup on
the coaster and so on.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to create
rings on your table.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I understand the wish
for orderliness in life.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:10%
It's my firm belief--

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.360 align:middle line:10%
and I think we've
seen this certainly

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.030 align:middle line:10%
in this country for
more than 200 years--

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.570 align:middle line:10%
you can experiment with
the most radical questions

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.840 align:middle line:10%
and still keep your hands
on the plow, so to speak.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.840 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes, I agree.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.730 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: I never see the
best experimenters neglecting

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:10%
their relationships or throwing
away ruinous sums of money.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:90%
William James didn't do that.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:90%
You don't do that.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Bill Wilson, the founder
of Alcoholics Anonymous,

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.170 align:middle line:90%
didn't do that.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.580 align:middle line:10%
Imagine if Bill,
when he was asking,

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.270 align:middle line:10%
is there a spiritual
solution to addiction, said,

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.340 align:middle line:10%
no, that's going too far.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.500 align:middle line:10%
I can't experiment
with Ouija boards.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't experiment with LSD.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't experiment
with Christian Science.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Bill did all these things.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.690 align:middle line:10%
And he brought us the 12
steps, which have radically

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.190 align:middle line:10%
improved people's lives.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.480 align:middle line:10%
And he stayed sober
the rest of his life.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.850 align:middle line:90%
So he also was a hero to me.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:90%
He was a radical experimenter.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And he never once
let go of what he

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:84%
owed to people,
his relationships,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:90%
the maintenance of his home.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.150 align:middle line:90%
So the critics go too far.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And they actually really
invest our culture

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.350 align:middle line:84%
with a kind of fundamentalism,
an anti-intellectual

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:90%
fundamentalism.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.106 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:16.350 align:middle line:90%
But even the individual--

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are cultural
leaders, authors, philosophers,

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:90%
and so forth--

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:21.790 align:middle line:90%
but even the individual.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though if you
start pulling on that string,

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.090 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
somehow lose the thread

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.530 align:middle line:90%
of the rest of your life.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:28.658 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:36:28.658 --> 00:36:29.616 align:middle line:90%
You may find your life.

00:36:29.616 --> 00:36:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why do we think we
have to give up our previously

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.600 align:middle line:84%
held beliefs even just to open
to studying something else?

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.726 align:middle line:90%
We can reject it afterward.

00:36:37.726 --> 00:36:38.683 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Brilliant.

00:36:38.683 --> 00:36:39.531 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant

00:36:39.531 --> 00:36:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We're afraid.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: That black and
white thinking is the worst

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:84%
drain on the intellect and
on personal experimentation.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, as you
were just alluding,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.260 align:middle line:84%
if you're interested in any of
the things we're talking about,

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.300 align:middle line:84%
if you want to read
"Psycho-Cybernetics,"

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean you have
to stop being a good Catholic

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.580 align:middle line:84%
or good Presbyterian or a good
atheist or whatever it is you

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.380 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.040 align:middle line:84%
People are so obsessed with
this idea of the labels

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.470 align:middle line:84%
that they wear, and when
they lose those labels,

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:84%
they will be completely
lost themselves.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:84%
That's where identification
becomes restricting.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, yesterday, I was doing
an interview with Mark Stavish

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:90%
on his book "Egregores."

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.428 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Excellent.

00:37:20.428 --> 00:37:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And each one of
these is essentially its own

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.690 align:middle line:84%
collective entity that has
created through this belief,

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.590 align:middle line:84%
this collectively held belief,
and then fed through that--

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, the end of
that, the decay cycle of that

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.590 align:middle line:84%
is where dogmatism
starts setting in.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.604 align:middle line:84%
And it can come
from any direction.

00:37:41.604 --> 00:37:43.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I'm
very interested in

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and that I write a
lot about in the book

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.970 align:middle line:84%
is ESP research,
psychical research.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:10%
Since the early 1930s
in this country alone,

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:10%
we've had incredible
clinical evidence

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:10%
of ESP research come through.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's an established
fact that some kind

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:05.160 align:middle line:10%
of sensory perception
is possible beyond what

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.390 align:middle line:10%
we know as the five senses.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:08.305 align:middle line:90%
That is settled science.

00:38:08.305 --> 00:38:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And, yet, critics will
continue to deny it.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.892 align:middle line:84%
They will continue to move
the goalposts, so to speak.

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:16.350 align:middle line:84%
They will say,
these are accidents.

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.000 align:middle line:90%
These things can't be repeated.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're wrong on
every single count.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it's this
fear that if we up

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.870 align:middle line:84%
end the assumptions
that we grew up with,

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:29.490 align:middle line:84%
we're somehow going
to go floating off

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.870 align:middle line:90%
into space somewhere.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.580 align:middle line:10%
There's one
materialist philosopher

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.640 align:middle line:10%
who defines human
beings as moist robots.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's all we are.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.350 align:middle line:84%
He's completely wrong
because we see, just

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:84%
looking in the field of
neuroplasticity alone,

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:46.590 align:middle line:84%
we can see through brain scans
that your sustained thoughts

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.410 align:middle line:84%
actually alter the neural
pathways in your brain.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:84%
They alter the gray
matter in your brain.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.070 align:middle line:90%
You don't see that in a machine.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.720 align:middle line:90%
You don't see that in a machine.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:10%
A computer based
on its programming

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:02.740 align:middle line:10%
can evolve different models
and analyses and so on.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But it can't change
its own hardware.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It can externally
if you send out

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.210 align:middle line:90%
electronic signal to a robot.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But it cannot from within
its own devices change its

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.180 align:middle line:90%
hardware.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.103 align:middle line:90%
We can.

00:39:13.103 --> 00:39:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: We can.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:14.970 align:middle line:90%
We can.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.740 align:middle line:84%
We see this in the
placebo response.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.880 align:middle line:90%
We see this in neuroplasticity.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.990 align:middle line:10%
This materialist philosopher
who has tenure somewhere,

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.980 align:middle line:10%
he's just wrong.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He's wrong.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: It's a lovely
expression-- moist robot.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:25.540 align:middle line:90%
That's cute.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.360 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.000 align:middle line:90%
But it's demonstrably wrong.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Materialism just doesn't
cover the basis of life

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.910 align:middle line:90%
in the 21st century.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
catch up with that.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.548 align:middle line:90%
So we're going into the book.

00:39:36.548 --> 00:39:39.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to dive down
into kind of the tenants

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.720 align:middle line:90%
as you lay them out.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.000 align:middle line:90%
And so one of it is--

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.130 align:middle line:90%
we talked about this earlier--

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.790 align:middle line:84%
having a very clear
intention or idea of what

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:90%
it is we wish to select--

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.470 align:middle line:90%
create.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Create.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:52.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, I won't say manifest.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.093 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: I'm fine with that.

00:39:55.093 --> 00:39:56.575 align:middle line:84%
I will not be
dogmatic on language.

00:39:56.575 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:90%
You can say manifest.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.710 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And we talked
about that a little bit.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But any clarification
on that statement

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:06.520 align:middle line:84%
about having a clear
intention, a clear thought?

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.830 align:middle line:10%
And is it attached
to something that's

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.620 align:middle line:10%
real in us versus
just another program

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.440 align:middle line:10%
coming in that we think
we ought to manifest?

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Wonderful question.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.460 align:middle line:10%
I do believe, as
we were discussing,

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.240 align:middle line:10%
that probably the most powerful
single step an individual can

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:10%
take in his or her
life is arriving

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:10%
at a passionately held,
even obsessive aim.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We think of the word
obsessive as a negative today.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.920 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to be
diagnosed and treated

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.940 align:middle line:90%
if you're obsessive.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.250 align:middle line:10%
But, actually, if you
look at everyone you

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.100 align:middle line:10%
regard as a hero, whoever that
person may be, whether it's

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.060 align:middle line:10%
Nelson Mandela or
Helen Keller, whomever,

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:47.240 align:middle line:10%
you will always find in that
person's life one obsessive

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.040 align:middle line:10%
aim.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you whether
Winston Churchill fretted

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.500 align:middle line:84%
over his tennis game, but I
can tell you his aim in life

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.580 align:middle line:90%
was to defeat fascism.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he'll
always be remembered for.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Your heroes, artists
activists, soldiers,

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:03.850 align:middle line:84%
they always had that one central
aim for which they stood.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:08.080 align:middle line:10%
And, yes, it was obsessive
almost without exception.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I think well-roundness is
overrated, to be honest.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm being a little
glib but only a little.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.160 align:middle line:90%
And write down your aim.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:90%
You must write down your aim.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what is it
about committing it to paper?

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.945 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: I think when you
commit something to paper--

00:41:21.945 --> 00:41:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad you
put it that way--

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
you are almost bringing through
a tactile actualization of what

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:90%
you want in the here and now.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:84%
When you're holding that
piece of paper in your hands,

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that's the first
physical representation

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:42.790 align:middle line:84%
of the actualization of what
you want, of what your aim is.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It also serves as
a kind of contract.

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It can focus the mind.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.330 align:middle line:84%
We underestimate certificates
and contracts sometimes.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Putting your name on a
piece of paper somewhere,

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:52.789 align:middle line:90%
it means something.

00:41:52.789 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:90%
It should mean something.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.220 align:middle line:10%
I ask people to write out their
aim in very plain language

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:01.240 align:middle line:10%
that anyone can understand
and then sign it and date it

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:10%
and hold yourself
to it for dear life.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
show it to anybody

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.257 align:middle line:84%
unless you have a very
close, creative partner.

00:42:08.257 --> 00:42:10.840 align:middle line:10%
You shouldn't show it to anybody
because you don't want anyone

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.490 align:middle line:10%
to kind of knock
you off your focus.

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you can share
it with yourself repeatedly.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:84%
You look at it, and each
time you look at it,

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.610 align:middle line:90%
you're selecting again.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.360 align:middle line:84%
You're selecting a commitment
to that thing again.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Absolutely so.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely so.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.320 align:middle line:90%
And you can rewrite it.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:27.070 align:middle line:84%
As you were saying before,
you don't have to stop what--

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.650 align:middle line:84%
you haven't just set
your path in cement,

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:31.669 align:middle line:90%
and it can never be changed.

00:42:31.669 --> 00:42:33.460 align:middle line:84%
If you want to change
something, change it.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you should be changing
it to some degree or another.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:84%
There should be events
and circumstances

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:42.730 align:middle line:84%
that maybe necessitate
tweaking here and there.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And it should take you
a while to arrive at it.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's
growth that happens.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: There's growth.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Next one is after you
write this down, like

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.060 align:middle line:84%
with money and
prosperity in particular,

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.590 align:middle line:90%
write down a certain amount.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, this scares people
a lot of times, like, oh,

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.640 align:middle line:90%
is it too little?

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it too much?

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And then people say, I want
to make $2 million next year,

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.530 align:middle line:90%
and they're a librarian.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:08.800 align:middle line:84%
This is where we have a few
little stumbles and hiccups

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.120 align:middle line:90%
in the New Age movement.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.042 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: For sure.

00:43:11.042 --> 00:43:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And it leads to great
disappointment sometimes.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.500 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.550 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
about manifesting

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:19.670 align:middle line:84%
for your own functional reality
a certain amount of money,

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.452 align:middle line:84%
how do you determine
what that should be?

00:43:22.452 --> 00:43:24.160 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: That's
a wonderful question.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
to unpack there.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.970 align:middle line:10%
For a long time, I
resisted the idea

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.160 align:middle line:10%
of writing down a sum of
money and writing down

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.950 align:middle line:10%
a date by which I wanted to
receive it because I felt

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:35.440 align:middle line:10%
that it was too materialistic.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.290 align:middle line:10%
It seemed to violate my
sense of spiritual ethics.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:39.220 align:middle line:90%
I felt gross somehow.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
have that conflict.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.750 align:middle line:10%
But I got past that
because I thought

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.729 align:middle line:10%
to myself, look, if
we're here to experiment,

00:43:46.729 --> 00:43:47.770 align:middle line:10%
we're here to experiment.

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:48.853 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to try this.

00:43:48.853 --> 00:43:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I found extraordinary
results with it,

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.130 align:middle line:90%
which I write about in the book.

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that what one needs to
do is write down a sum of money

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and a period of time by
which you'll receive it

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and a means by which you'll
receive it that is bold

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.704 align:middle line:84%
but that also feels
emotionally persuasive.

00:44:06.704 --> 00:44:08.620 align:middle line:84%
If you write down I'm
going to have $2 million

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:12.940 align:middle line:84%
by January 15 or whatever,
it may simply not

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:18.040 align:middle line:84%
be something that you are
emotively capable of digesting.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.700 align:middle line:90%
You might not believe it.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
bold, but you also

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.770 align:middle line:84%
have to be able to
persuade yourself

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:25.334 align:middle line:90%
that this is really true and--

00:44:25.334 --> 00:44:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That have
the means to do it.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: You
have the means do it.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.450 align:middle line:90%
What service?

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:29.250 align:middle line:90%
What method?

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:31.560 align:middle line:10%
What are you
providing to do this?

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as if you're
throwing intellect to the wind.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.052 align:middle line:84%
It's this dance that
you have to go into.

00:44:37.052 --> 00:44:38.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're repeating
something to yourself

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.100 align:middle line:84%
that you don't believe,
it's not really

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.510 align:middle line:90%
going to be an active selection.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think by definition,
an aim is actionable.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it's just a daydream.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:50.985 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So, for you, when you
first started writing it down,

00:44:50.985 --> 00:44:54.810 align:middle line:84%
give us an idea of proportion
in your own world of how you

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.390 align:middle line:84%
decided to start
manifesting financially.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.275 align:middle line:84%
Was it, I want to do 30%
better than last year

00:45:01.275 --> 00:45:03.810 align:middle line:84%
or 50% better than
last year doing

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.130 align:middle line:90%
the thing I'm committed to?

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Or did you just pick an
outrageously large number?

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: No.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.207 align:middle line:10%
It was a large number but
not outrageously large.

00:45:12.207 --> 00:45:14.040 align:middle line:10%
I was reading the book
"Think and Grow Rich"

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.500 align:middle line:10%
by Napoleon Hill, one
of my favorite books.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.110 align:middle line:10%
I probably reread it twice a
year at this point in my life.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:23.100 align:middle line:90%
And this was in the year 2013.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And I had been doing
what a lot of people

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.160 align:middle line:84%
do with self-help books, which
is that they kind of skim

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:28.960 align:middle line:90%
through them.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.040 align:middle line:84%
They pick out the exercises that
they think are suited to them.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And with a book like
"Think and Grow Rich,"

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.317 align:middle line:90%
you have to do everything.

00:45:35.317 --> 00:45:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And you have to do it as
though your life depends on it.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.390 align:middle line:90%
I always tell that to friends.

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And I decided, I'm really
going to walk the walk now.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.897 align:middle line:90%
So this was in 2013.

00:45:43.897 --> 00:45:45.480 align:middle line:10%
And I said to myself,
I am going to do

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.810 align:middle line:10%
every exercise in
this book literally,

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:51.820 align:middle line:10%
as if life itself hinges on it.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I threw
out my prudishness

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.850 align:middle line:84%
about writing down
a number and a date.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I wrote down a number
that was a large number

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.810 align:middle line:84%
but that I felt was
believable, to me at least.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I put it on a yellow
stick 'em note

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:08.020 align:middle line:84%
inside the book where most
of our thoughts in life go.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything from shopping
list to will and testament--

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sticky note.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: --winds up
on a sticky note somewhere

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.560 align:middle line:90%
in someone's house.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.460 align:middle line:90%
So I wrote this down.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I wrote down the number.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.520 align:middle line:90%
I wrote down the date.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was at a
particular period of life.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:26.820 align:middle line:10%
I went off, did various things
that I needed to do in my life.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.950 align:middle line:10%
About eight or
nine months later,

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:31.200 align:middle line:10%
having forgotten
actually that I had

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.192 align:middle line:10%
left that stick 'em
note in the book,

00:46:33.192 --> 00:46:35.400 align:middle line:10%
I came upon it in a repeat
reading of "Think and Grow

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.200 align:middle line:10%
Rich."

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.880 align:middle line:84%
The very sum of money
that I wrote down

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.630 align:middle line:84%
came to me at that
very time frame

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.630 align:middle line:84%
that I had identified,
the very thing.

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Pitch perfect.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
this is quite remarkable.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So I've been experimenting
with it since then,

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.250 align:middle line:84%
sometimes smaller sums of money
for other periods of time.

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I now have a very
large sum of money

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that I've written down for
a very specific reason.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:90%
And I've put a date on it.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's not so far
off in the future

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.040 align:middle line:90%
that we'll all forget about it.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.930 align:middle line:10%
So I can come back at
some point and reveal

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:13.870 align:middle line:10%
to you and the viewers whether
I've succeeded or failed.

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:15.560 align:middle line:10%
But I do believe
it's a valid method.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about all
this within the context of New

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Thought and of selection.

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:10%
How does that work any
differently than Joel Osteen?

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:26.746 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:47:26.746 --> 00:47:27.870 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's interesting.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:30.510 align:middle line:10%
Joel Osteen and a lot of
the prosperity ministers

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:10%
are basically taking leaps
directly out of New Thought.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:35.430 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes they
don't even know it.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:37.500 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they don't
want to acknowledge it.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.550 align:middle line:10%
Pat Robertson likes to use an
expression, law of reciprocity.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.760 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing other than the law
of attraction, just retooled.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.220 align:middle line:10%
And the great Norman
Vincent Peale, who I love,

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.260 align:middle line:10%
who is a conservative
Protestant minister who

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.090 align:middle line:10%
wrote "Power of
Positive Thinking,"

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:54.000 align:middle line:10%
everything that Peale
did was to take the ideas

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.170 align:middle line:10%
that we're talking about.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And he reprocessed it
through scriptural language

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.620 align:middle line:84%
that the church-going
public was comfortable with.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.690 align:middle line:10%
If you read "Power of
Positive Thinking,"

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:06.240 align:middle line:10%
you'll find scriptural
references throughout the book.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.850 align:middle line:10%
But the ideas themselves
are very occult

00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:11.010 align:middle line:10%
and mystical and mysterious.

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:13.685 align:middle line:10%
And he would have been right
at home sitting at this table.

00:48:13.685 --> 00:48:16.060 align:middle line:10%
He just would have given you
chapter and verse from Bible

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.000 align:middle line:10%
and said, make no
mistake, Regina,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm just a conservative Dutch
Protestant reform minister.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.320 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But he was drinking very
deeply from these waters.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And Peale made it OK for
Evangelicals and Protestants

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:30.360 align:middle line:90%
to use these ideas.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.630 align:middle line:10%
Although today, within the
prosperity gospel movement,

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.790 align:middle line:10%
Peale's name is
hardly ever mentioned

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:37.680 align:middle line:10%
because they find
him a little too far

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.190 align:middle line:10%
out because he didn't disavow
his connections to New Thought.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:42.770 align:middle line:90%
He didn't misadvertise them.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't disavow them,
which I really respect in Peale

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.670 align:middle line:90%
and I really applaud in Peale.

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:50.910 align:middle line:10%
Joel Osteen, who gets
made fun of a lot,

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:54.270 align:middle line:10%
is one of the very, very
few prosperity ministers

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:57.600 align:middle line:10%
who will cite Peale as a
source, as an influence.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.607 align:middle line:84%
And I really respect that
about him because most of them

00:49:00.607 --> 00:49:02.190 align:middle line:84%
will claim, I've
never heard the name.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Try to distance themselves.

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Too radical.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Osteen acknowledges
Peale's an influence.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:09.354 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing,
he's acknowledging

00:49:09.354 --> 00:49:10.520 align:middle line:90%
New Thought as an influence.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.670 align:middle line:90%
And I appreciate that.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking a
moment ago about the power

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.264 align:middle line:90%
of positive thinking, right?

00:49:18.264 --> 00:49:20.805 align:middle line:84%
Then there's Joseph Murphy and
"The Power of the Subconscious

00:49:20.805 --> 00:49:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Mind."

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.760 align:middle line:10%
And it's really hard
to ignore the influence

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.240 align:middle line:10%
of the subconscious mind when it
comes to selection and creation

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.270 align:middle line:10%
of your reality because you
have this whole invisible bag

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:33.680 align:middle line:10%
of stuff.

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's ever
happened, everything

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:39.080 align:middle line:84%
we've been traumatized by,
every collective belief,

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.140 align:middle line:90%
every egregore.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Right.

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:41.740 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we've got all
of it that is silently working

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.820 align:middle line:90%
with or against us.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.160 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's funny.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.590 align:middle line:10%
A few years ago, I
came upon a file--

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:53.910 align:middle line:10%
and I write about this
in "The Miracle Club."

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.540 align:middle line:10%
I came upon a file of
letters, which is now

00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:00.770 align:middle line:10%
in my possession, which readers
had written to Joseph Murphy

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:02.240 align:middle line:10%
after he died.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.120 align:middle line:10%
And the publishing house for
which I had worked at one time

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.830 align:middle line:10%
just basically
collected these letters,

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:09.140 align:middle line:10%
and they were stowed away,
just sitting somewhere

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.917 align:middle line:10%
in a darkened file cabinet.

00:50:10.917 --> 00:50:12.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'm reading
through these letters.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.350 align:middle line:10%
And they're filled with these
very earnest and sometimes

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.020 align:middle line:10%
desperate pleas
to Murphy saying,

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.820 align:middle line:10%
I've been using
your affirmations.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm still sick.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:21.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm still poor.

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:22.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm still this.

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:22.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm still that.

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:24.326 align:middle line:84%
And I write about
this in the book

00:50:24.326 --> 00:50:25.984 align:middle line:90%
because I love Joseph Murphy.

00:50:25.984 --> 00:50:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I did, too.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: And I believe
in Murphy's teachings,

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and I believe he was a
really, really good man.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.240 align:middle line:90%
And I admire him.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.270 align:middle line:10%
But I think he went
too far in intimating

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:40.070 align:middle line:10%
to people in his books that
some law of creation emanating

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.980 align:middle line:10%
through the subconscious
mind that could be tapped

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.980 align:middle line:10%
through prayer and affirmation
controls everything,

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.360 align:middle line:10%
controls everything.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.530 align:middle line:90%
And I break with that.

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.350 align:middle line:84%
As I was alluding earlier,
we live-- or, at least,

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:52.460 align:middle line:90%
we experience--

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.930 align:middle line:84%
many laws and forces,
including geography, accidents,

00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:02.660 align:middle line:84%
economics, politics, a tsunami
sweeps through a South Pacific

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:03.560 align:middle line:90%
nation.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.570 align:middle line:10%
That is not because of
the thought vibrations

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.660 align:middle line:10%
of the people living
in that nation.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.760 align:middle line:84%
A law to be a law
must be consistent.

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's experienced
in different ways.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.680 align:middle line:84%
The law of gravity
is consistent.

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Its ever operative.

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to experience
it differently on Earth

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.600 align:middle line:84%
than you will on
the planet Jupiter.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.610 align:middle line:10%
You're not going to
experience it all in space

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:23.840 align:middle line:10%
because there's no mass.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean gravity
isn't occurring.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.680 align:middle line:90%
But it's affected by mass.

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.640 align:middle line:10%
So it is with the
law of mentation.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So it is with the
law of mentation.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things
going on in our lives that

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.590 align:middle line:84%
are going to influence
what we experience.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And much as I love Murphy, I'm
reading these heartbreaking

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:41.840 align:middle line:84%
letters from people
who need help.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:47.720 align:middle line:10%
And I feel he didn't give
sufficient acknowledgment

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.410 align:middle line:10%
to the complexity of life.

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And even the complexity
of the subconscious mind.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:53.840 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: Even the
complexity of the subconscious.

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.130 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And I agree.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:52:00.890 align:middle line:84%
One of my mentors, the wild and
crazy Russian ballerina Madame

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:05.806 align:middle line:84%
Bovee, crazy, wild
woman met a physician.

00:52:05.806 --> 00:52:06.930 align:middle line:90%
She was much older than me.

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:07.799 align:middle line:90%
She was my mentor.

00:52:07.799 --> 00:52:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Interesting.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And really, in ways
that I could have never made up

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.410 align:middle line:90%
nor hoped for.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And she had this by her bedside.

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So she was a really big
devotee of Joseph Murphy,

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.830 align:middle line:90%
reading about it.

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But I started seeing as
time went on the limitations

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.980 align:middle line:84%
as well, as you
beautiful as the work is.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And part of it I
look at is really

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:30.710 align:middle line:84%
that kind of sneaky
sabotaging part

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.080 align:middle line:84%
of the subconscious
mind that really

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:90%
has to be properly addressed.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this is where
prayer can come in actually.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.910 align:middle line:10%
There are times-- you're
talking about self-sabotage--

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:47.270 align:middle line:10%
there are times where we are
so crushed by the circumstances

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:51.230 align:middle line:10%
of life that we cannot direct
our thoughts and our minds

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:52.880 align:middle line:10%
in the way we want to.

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think nature
plays a cruel trick on us.

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I think at such times, that's
where prayer can come in.

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Prayer is almost an escape
hatch from the weight

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:03.710 align:middle line:90%
of our own psyches.

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:06.950 align:middle line:84%
There really are times
where we are unable even

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.770 align:middle line:84%
to pray as if we've
already received.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:11.440 align:middle line:90%
That has scriptural basis.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph Murphy would
talk about that a lot.

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:16.010 align:middle line:84%
You must go into
private and pray feeling

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:19.070 align:middle line:84%
that you have already
received, and so you shall.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:20.330 align:middle line:90%
That's not always possible.

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.070 align:middle line:84%
That's simply not
always possible.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:23.810 align:middle line:10%
My contention in the
book is that there's

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.300 align:middle line:10%
no rules with regard to prayer.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.842 align:middle line:84%
You can throw yourself
on your knees.

00:53:27.842 --> 00:53:29.799 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what
I was going to bring up.

00:53:29.799 --> 00:53:30.960 align:middle line:90%
You can demand and beg.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Right.

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's scriptural
basis for that too.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:37.100 align:middle line:84%
The patriarchs and matriarchs
would argue with God,

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.570 align:middle line:90%
would answer back God.

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Look at Adam and Eve.

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Look at Cain, Abraham,
Sarah, Jonah, Job.

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.750 align:middle line:84%
They all have these
ongoing arguments with God,

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and they would get
their backs up.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, in fact,
they would get their way.

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Cain said to God, the punishment
that you give me is too great.

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I can't bear it.

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:55.708 align:middle line:84%
And God said, all right,
I'm going to amend it.

00:53:55.708 --> 00:53:58.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to put a mark on you
so that nobody will hurt you,

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:00.280 align:middle line:10%
the so-called mark of Cain.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.350 align:middle line:10%
And actually, there
is record in scripture

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:05.780 align:middle line:10%
of God changing his
mind, so to speak,

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.580 align:middle line:10%
when one of the matriarchs or
patriarchs argues with him.

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So to me, there's no rulebook
with regard to prayer.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:14.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the escape
hatch that we're given.

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
any way you want.

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we can't ignore
the directive of the soul.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.820 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Who wins?

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ultimately,
you may not know it,

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:26.430 align:middle line:84%
pinging and ponging
through life.

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But if the thing that
you're trying to manifest

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.370 align:middle line:84%
is completely out of sync with
what your soul has come here

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:34.071 align:middle line:84%
to do, you can do all
you want, but it probably

00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:35.570 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to line
up well for you.

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:37.490 align:middle line:10%
I think that's beautifully put.

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:39.080 align:middle line:10%
And I've asked
myself this question,

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.660 align:middle line:10%
and this is a part of an ongoing
process for me as a seeker

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:42.530 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:45.590 align:middle line:84%
We've all had the experience of
wanting something, not getting

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:47.025 align:middle line:84%
it, and later
saying, thank God--

00:54:47.025 --> 00:54:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank,
God, I didn't get it.

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: That would
have been the worst thing.

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: What's
going on there?

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.180 align:middle line:10%
That's a question
that I as a seeker

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.860 align:middle line:10%
have right now
because there have

00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:56.660 align:middle line:10%
been certain jobs I wanted.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And, boy, if you had
asked me 10 years ago,

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I could have been very
persuasive about why

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I want this and what
I'm going to accomplish.

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Didn't get it, felt
disappointed, even frustrated,

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:10.187 align:middle line:84%
and also felt a great
relief as time passed.

00:55:10.187 --> 00:55:12.020 align:middle line:84%
That would have been
the worst thing for me.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have
had time to write.

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.840 align:middle line:10%
I would have been taken
out of my element.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.881 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

00:55:16.881 --> 00:55:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's where I give
a lot of respect to the soul

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.260 align:middle line:90%
force of our being.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.510 align:middle line:90%
There is something higher.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.149 align:middle line:90%
There's a higher intellect.

00:55:25.149 --> 00:55:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph Murphy would have
called it the subconscious

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:27.870 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.710 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things I applaud
in his work is that he said,

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:33.530 align:middle line:10%
the subconscious mind
has ways and means

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:35.081 align:middle line:10%
of which you know not.

00:55:35.081 --> 00:55:36.080 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.420 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: So just hold
whatever it is that you wish

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:41.260 align:middle line:10%
for, and allow it to unfold
without insisting on the means.

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And now that comes
down to desire

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:46.780 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
language to me--

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean desire
in terms of someone

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:53.450 align:middle line:84%
you want to have sex
with or whatever.

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that
kind of carnal desire

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.300 align:middle line:84%
or even sensorial
desire, sensual desire,

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.270 align:middle line:84%
but this subtle
voice, this pinging

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:03.770 align:middle line:84%
in the heart of
something you wish

00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:05.540 align:middle line:90%
to bring forth in yourself.

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Your own calling, your own
voice, your own genius.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:11.190 align:middle line:84%
That desire is the
language to me of the soul.

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully put.

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell people,
don't quibble with the means

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.650 align:middle line:90%
by which something reaches you.

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:20.780 align:middle line:10%
You might have a
soul desire, and it

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.840 align:middle line:10%
might present itself to you in
a way that's very unexpected.

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Do not quibble with the means.

00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:28.700 align:middle line:84%
You might actually
pray to get better,

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and somebody presents
you with a pill.

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And you say, I don't want
to take the pill because I'm

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.220 align:middle line:90%
depending on prayer healing.

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.980 align:middle line:84%
That may be the means
right there coming to you.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Don't argue with it.

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Accept it.

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:41.180 align:middle line:10%
A philosopher once
said to me, what

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:43.080 align:middle line:10%
do you do when someone
offers you a gift?

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.180 align:middle line:10%
And I look at him blankly.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.150 align:middle line:10%
And he said, you accept.

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.450 align:middle line:10%
You accept it.

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:50.270 align:middle line:10%
It's very simple, but
it has to be remembered.

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:53.400 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: The other thing is
sometimes it happens in steps.

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know
it, but it's all

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:59.030 align:middle line:84%
being arranged in this
larger mind matrix for you.

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But you have to take a step
that may not look pleasant.

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And you think,
that's not my goal.

00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:04.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Beautifully put.

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I think
about that in my own career.

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:09.665 align:middle line:84%
Some of the media jobs--
being a news anchor--

00:57:09.665 --> 00:57:11.570 align:middle line:84%
that's the worst
job I've ever had.

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But I needed to
have that to have

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:17.450 align:middle line:84%
the credentials and the respect
to be able to then put forward

00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:20.420 align:middle line:84%
the things that were of
my own creation later.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:23.540 align:middle line:84%
That did well in my
kind of bank account

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.030 align:middle line:84%
in terms of character
and experience.

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:27.350 align:middle line:90%
I hated the job.

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully put.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I had a job I hated
also as a reporter.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.940 align:middle line:10%
I was a police reporter.

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:33.065 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, I remember.

00:57:33.065 --> 00:57:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: And I write
about this very explicitly

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.290 align:middle line:90%
in the book.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:40.839 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'd never want
to go through it again.

00:57:40.839 --> 00:57:42.130 align:middle line:90%
But I'm glad I went through it.

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:43.254 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad I went through it.

00:57:43.254 --> 00:57:45.405 align:middle line:84%
I just never want
to repeat it again.

00:57:45.405 --> 00:57:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have to be
like the Hebrews wandering

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.870 align:middle line:84%
in the desert, and
those are the terms

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:52.210 align:middle line:84%
by which you're going to
receive some sort of message

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:53.140 align:middle line:90%
or revelation.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.139 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:57:54.139 --> 00:57:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And, again, don't look
at the path itself.

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Take the next step and let it
reveal itself to you, right?

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Beautifully put.

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Neville, my hero,
would always say,

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:06.760 align:middle line:90%
don't condition your desires.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Don't say that it
must come in this way

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:10.330 align:middle line:90%
or it must come in that way.

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:15.190 align:middle line:84%
It will come out
in whatever manner

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:19.220 align:middle line:84%
is the most harmonious and
appropriate and nonviolent

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.020 align:middle line:90%
unfoldment.

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Let it happen.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't condition it.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Let it happen.

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.690 align:middle line:90%
We're on the same page.

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So, in summary, these are
some of the things, the bullet

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.970 align:middle line:90%
points, that are in your book.

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Disassociate from destructive
people and forces.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:33.370 align:middle line:10%
Just very quick comments
on these before we go.

00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:36.220 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: We feel that we
have to stand in proximity with

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.450 align:middle line:10%
destructive people.

00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:38.410 align:middle line:90%
You do not.

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:41.530 align:middle line:10%
You must vow to
yourself internally

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:44.200 align:middle line:10%
to separate from them and,
at the first possible moment,

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.060 align:middle line:10%
physically separate.

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.874 align:middle line:90%
Vital to your life.

00:58:47.874 --> 00:58:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Boy, is it.

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Use every means possible to
improve your mental acuity.

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:54.340 align:middle line:90%
I believe in a D-day approach.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.370 align:middle line:10%
If you have a problem or
a need, throw everything

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:00.790 align:middle line:10%
at it, every single means,
traditional, non-traditional.

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Stop at nothing.

00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Grow
strong physically.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:05.560 align:middle line:10%
Extremely--

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.270 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Most people say,
what's that have to do with it?

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ:
Extremely important.

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:11.320 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea what you
can stand up to physically.

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.950 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely remarkable.

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:15.449 align:middle line:84%
You can ride your bicycle in
a blizzard if you need to.

00:59:15.449 --> 00:59:16.990 align:middle line:84%
You should learn
that about yourself.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.950 align:middle line:84%
It'll give you a
sense of agency.

00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Push yourself.

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Test yourself.

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.885 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Push yourself.

00:59:19.885 --> 00:59:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This one,
seek no one's approval.

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:24.070 align:middle line:10%
It is so vital.

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Nothing stymies our
experiments more than the wish

00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:28.660 align:middle line:90%
for respectability.

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:31.930 align:middle line:10%
The wish for respectability--
it absolutely flattens out

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:32.767 align:middle line:10%
our creativity.

00:59:32.767 --> 00:59:34.600 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And these
are the two follow-ons.

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.240 align:middle line:10%
Basically, go your own way.

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.370 align:middle line:10%
Just go your own way.

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:39.280 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ:
Including physically.

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.250 align:middle line:10%
Including physically.

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.740 align:middle line:10%
If you don't like
taking the bus,

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:42.865 align:middle line:10%
why don't you walk to work?

00:59:42.865 --> 00:59:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it'll take
you two hours a day.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, a guy named Henry
David Thoreau did that.

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:47.500 align:middle line:10%
Watch out.

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And any one final comment
before we say goodbye this time?

00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:54.520 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: My one final
comment is that you have no

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.370 align:middle line:10%
idea how powerful you are
if you just unplug from

00:59:57.370 --> 01:00:00.620 align:middle line:10%
the conditioning, unplug from
what you're expected to do.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to make these
radical changes in your life

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.600 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.820 align:middle line:10%
Everything begins
with an inner vow.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.300 align:middle line:10%
Search through yourself.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.520 align:middle line:10%
Make that vow.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.809 align:middle line:84%
And life will begin to
unfold in that direction.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With that,
thank you once again.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Thank you.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm sure we'll
be back here again--

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: That'd be great.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --in no time flat.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:18.430 align:middle line:10%

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:20.080 align:middle line:10%
Excellent.
