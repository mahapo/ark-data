>>AUBREY MARCUS: I was
always a philosopher,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.520 align:middle line:84%
always looking, and thinking,
and feeling, and experimenting.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.960 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was 30, I
was really frustrated.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I just had lost faith.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately the choice
to enter into polyamory

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
was I had a craving
to experience

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:90%
a variety of different people.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.622 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea how hard it was
going to be, like absolutely.

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:90%
It was the middle of the day.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I had a good sleep and I was
drinking a sparkling water,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.800 align:middle line:84%
drove out of my gate, and
completely blacked out.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I have a faint memory
of the Jaws of Life.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up in the hospital.

>>REGINA MEREDITH:
So that brings us

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:90%
to the subject of ayahuasca.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what it's like to be in
the dark, what, for seven days?

>>MARCUS: I've done a
lot of different things.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.550 align:middle line:84%
This was the thing that had
the most visceral reaction.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Buddha,
why are you smiling?"

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And Buddha goes, "Why
aren't you smiling?"

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:84%
The thing that turned
everything around was--

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%

be a disfiguring car

Aubrey Marcus is a man
constantly searching

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:10%
for what it is to be a
man in today's world.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:10%
And it ain't easy, as
many men would agree.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:10%
But Aubrey has gained a large
following through his candor

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:10%
with some of life's most
vulnerable situations.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I said,
you just share it all

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
because men don't really
have a template right now.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And men in your
generation, which

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:84%
is a really unique
generation in my opinion,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:84%
are having to create
their own new template.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, women are
creating their new template,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:84%
all a backlash from
my parents' generation

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and my generation kind of being
that crossover point to say,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.015 align:middle line:84%
oh, honey, you can do
anything, gold stars.

[LAUGHING]

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:90%
So you all had parents like me.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And now it's created some very
empowered and very confusing

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:90%
times and people.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying
to help, really,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I think shine light on what
those vulnerabilities feel like

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and how you've
contended with them.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.327 align:middle line:90%
So welcome.

00:02:04.327 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Thank you.

Happy to be here.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.082 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
just dive into it.

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:11.127 align:middle line:84%
You said about 10 years
ago you were experimenting.

00:02:11.127 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:90%
You were finding your way.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
You were putting all kinds of
different things in your body.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And everything was going poorly.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Your health was breaking down.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:84%
You were a young man
in search of something.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what
were you looking for?

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:90%
What were you doing to yourself?

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
after the net effect?

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Well, ultimately I
was looking for my purpose.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:10%
I always felt like I had
something important to give.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:10%
I mean this started young.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.347 align:middle line:10%
When I was little and I would
see those movies where there

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:10%
would be this wise master
who would come in and tell

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:10%
that kid or that team, you
have an important message

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:10%
to deliver to the world.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And the kid would be
like no, no, not me.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.717 align:middle line:84%
Well, I always saw
myself in that role.

00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:90%
I'd be, like, where's my master?

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Where's the one who is going to
tell me that I have something?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Because I know I have it.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I know I have
something to offer.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:10%
And then by the time I was
30, I was really frustrated.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:10%
Really up until 28, that's
when it started to turn.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:90%
That's when I started--

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:90%
I got on Joe Rogan's podcast.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:90%
I started to build a platform.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
formation of being able

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
to deliver my messages and
what I had studied, and felt,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:90%
and understood about life--

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
even though I was still
young at that point.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But I was always a philosopher,
always looking, and thinking,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:90%
and feeling, and experimenting.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But really what I was searching
for was that sense of purpose

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of being effective
in delivering that purpose.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And in the absence of that,
I found surrogate things that

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:90%
could ameliorate this pain.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pain.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Which was
alcohol, partying,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:90%
whatever else I could get into.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's not one of those
stories of I woke up in Tijuana

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and there was a large
animal on one side

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.747 align:middle line:84%
and a bag of cocaine
on the other side.

00:03:43.747 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know where I was.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go quite that deep,
but it was a dark time,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.385 align:middle line:84%
and my health was
suffering for it and just

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
from the stress that I
was putting on myself.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And this feeling like I
should have made a right turn

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:84%
at some point, and
I made a left turn,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and here I am, and it's not
where I'm supposed to be--

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.188 align:middle line:90%
I just had lost faith.

00:04:00.188 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
people have not even

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.355 align:middle line:84%
had the chance to
lose faith yet,

00:04:03.355 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:90%
they just don't have faith.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.690 align:middle line:84%
People look at the world around
them and say what's the point?

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.978 align:middle line:84%
And so just kind of dropping
out into whatever is a surrogate

00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
seems to kind of be a
pattern in the world today.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And that crosses kind
of all generations.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:90%
It crosses ethnicities.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean now emerging
from COVID and having

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
a year alone with ourselves,
talk about dropping out.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.848 align:middle line:84%
Giving people an excuse
to do everything they

00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:31.515 align:middle line:84%
always wanted to do
but couldn't before.

00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] We're
finding ourselves

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
in an interesting
space because it also

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:84%
means we're seeing what was
valuable to us that we lost

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.998 align:middle line:84%
and what it is we need to
re-establish in our lives.

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at what happened.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:90%
You lost yourself.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And then you had a car wreck.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
You started looking into optimal
living just before that, right?

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Well, actually
the timeline is really--

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
the thing that turned
everything around

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:90%
was building my platform.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I did ayahuasca
for the first time.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:84%
This was right
around when I was 30.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I actually changed my
name at that point.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I went with my
middle name Aubrey.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
different things that happened.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And then launching
my company Onnit,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
which was a way to optimize
the physical body, which

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:90%
is kind of that base layer.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, even talking
about the physical body

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:84%
as separate from the mental
body is a myth ultimately.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So supporting the physical
body helps the mental,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.270 align:middle line:84%
helps the emotional, helps
the spiritual bodies.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
That was the key turning
point for me right around 30.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there was just this
rapid growth of my platform,

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
of the company,
everything was on track.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And that sense of purpose
started to find its way in.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course I went through
a very challenging period

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
of polyamory, which
I think played,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.258 align:middle line:84%
at least metaphysically, into
a pretty devastating car wreck.

00:05:44.258 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to get into
the car wreck and what that did.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Sure.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.505 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then I want to
get into the polyamory part,

00:05:49.505 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
because, first of all,
people are intrigued with it.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But secondly, I've watched
it for years and years.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Like maybe the last 25 years,
I watch from the outside.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I've never jumped
into that scenario.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's been very interesting.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I loved what you
had to say about it.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:90%
So what led up to--

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.867 align:middle line:84%
you were in a place because
of what you were dealing with.

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:12.200 align:middle line:90%
And you ended up in a car wreck.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.242 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to kind of
back engineer it a bit.

00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Yeah.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, ultimately the choice
to enter into polyamory

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
was a choice where
I recognized that I

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.310 align:middle line:84%
had a craving to experience a
variety of different people.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm someone who
just refuses to carry

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that type of
dishonesty, which is

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:84%
the solution for
a lot of people.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:84%
They just go do it on the
side or do it in secret

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.410 align:middle line:90%
and don't tell about it.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.948 align:middle line:84%
I mean the dishonesty
in adultery--

00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
even if people aren't
doing anything,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
the dishonesty about what they
want to do with their partners

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
is just creating this giant
breach in the partnership.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that I needed
another solution.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.661 align:middle line:84%
It was either very short
periods of monogamy

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.536 align:middle line:84%
where I kept moving from
partner to partner--

00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Serial monogamy.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Exactly.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.278 align:middle line:84%
But I found someone
I really loved.

00:06:56.278 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And I understood philosophically
the nature of love.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
That love isn't
something that should

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:90%
be possessed or contained.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
That love is something
that's universal.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And so with these kind of
philosophical underpinnings,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
spiritual underpinnings,
I was like, all right,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:90%
let's go for this.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And my partner was willing
to go there with me.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea how hard
it was going to be.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely no idea how
hard it was going to be.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And we were figuring
it out on our own.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.592 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the mentors that
were telling us, OK, watch out

00:07:25.592 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:90%
for this, watch out for this.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.502 align:middle line:84%
We just ran straight into
every challenge, every problem.

00:07:30.502 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And we were really
honest about it.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most direct
path to learning though.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: It was.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful for all of
it because I learned so much.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.323 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about what happened.

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:90%
First, you were the one, right?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: I was.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
were the one that wanted

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.260 align:middle line:90%
to experience someone else.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about that and what

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
happened with her,
her reaction and how

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.592 align:middle line:90%
she responded to all of this.

00:07:50.592 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Well, the
interesting thing was

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:90%
is that we agreed to do it.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I was seeing somebody
and she was devastated by it.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at her
like, what do you mean?

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We agreed.

00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: We agreed to this.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:90%
What is wrong?

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Did we not agree?

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, yeah, but I
still feel all these things.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't have
the sensitivity.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.930 align:middle line:90%
And I look back.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like what an idiot.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Because then as soon as
she found her partner,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:84%
her paramour, I went through
just absolute devastation.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Like I didn't know if I needed
to vomit, or cry, or run away.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Like it was just haunting
me day and night.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And I never really
freed myself from that.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:90%
I got better at it.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I learned coping
mechanisms and skills.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.375 align:middle line:90%
And I learned how to understand.

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And every once in
a while I could

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.280 align:middle line:84%
get to that mythical
place that I

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
was aiming for which
is compersion, which

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.860 align:middle line:84%
is getting pleasure from
her pleasure and the fact

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
that I was her living
a different life.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
spiritual truths

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that would allow me to really
hold it, occasionally I

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:90%
could touch that place.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, it
was just really, really hard.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Now that isn't to say
that I didn't, on my side,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:84%
enjoy many different,
amazing, beautiful people

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and have lovely relationships
and have a lot of enjoyment

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:84%
But it was an incredibly
chaotic and challenging time.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
my observation.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.232 align:middle line:90%
I lived in Sedona for years.

00:09:11.232 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So the Tantra groups
would come in and so

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I could watch from
afar, just set

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.630 align:middle line:84%
at the cafes, the
interactions, but up

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
close in a few different
occasions, friends of mine who

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.780 align:middle line:84%
entered in polyamorous
relationships.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one time
they were so open about it.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.270 align:middle line:84%
They had two mommies
and the daddy,

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.728 align:middle line:84%
and they all slept
in the same bed.

00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And they had two kids that went
to school with my son, right?

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was friends with
the wife in the situation.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:90%
They were married.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was fascinating to watch
what happened in real time,

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:90%
in real life.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So one night I remember
they invited me out

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:90%
to dinner, the three of them.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:90%
So I went out.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And the new one and the husband
were in the front and the wife

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:90%
and I were in the back.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And the hands of the
husband and the new one

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:90%
are finding one another.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're holding hands
and kind of looking lovingly

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:90%
at each other.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.115 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, first of all,
I start getting a stomach

00:10:03.115 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:90%
ache because I felt her energy.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Her eyes were darting
back and forth.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't hold
a conversation with me.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I thought she's in so much
pain, and she won't admit it.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:84%
No one will admit
what's going on.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And I started noticing
that over and over.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:84%
There was always, it
seemed, there came a point

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
that one of the three, or
however many, was the one that

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
had moist eyes, was
watching what was going on,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and feeling hurt, and not
speaking up because they

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:90%
quote "agreed to it."

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
What did you learn about that
when it's all over about, yes,

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:90%
we can make these agreements?

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But where are we
as human beings?

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Like you said you didn't know
whether to throw up or what,

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:90%
it was so devastating.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
for the others.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: I think
the understanding

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
should have been that we're
on this path to learn.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And we just didn't
have the experience.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually dedicate
this to this is your path

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to self-mastery, all of these
challenges that you're going

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:90%
to face--

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Abandonment,
jealousy, possession.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Absolutely.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be face
to face with everything.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be the
ayahuasca of relationship.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: And you're going
into it for that purpose.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And our commitment is to support
each other through this growth

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:10.900 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Just like if we were
going to hold someone's

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
hand through a ceremony and be
there to hold space for them,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that was-- would have been
a better way to go about it.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately you don't want
to be in an ayahuasca ceremony

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And so this was a great
path for that period

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't a path that
I felt I wanted to continue

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my life.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I had received a lot of
lessons, a lot of teachings,

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.120 align:middle line:84%
a lot of beauty, and I'm
a better person for it.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But when I had the opportunity
to be with my wife Vylana,

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:90%
it was a clear hell yes.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for this.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready for a different
type of union, a union

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
that we call our sacred
union, which is basically

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:84%
trusting that the relationship
will nourish both individuals.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So the relationship
comes before anything.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:84%
It comes before whatever other
ideas or fancies that we have.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not a sacrifice
of our own desires,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:84%
it's just the trust and the
faith that the relationship

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
is that force that will nourish
both people if we actually

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.887 align:middle line:84%
commit to the
relationship first.

00:12:11.887 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I see that.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's beautiful.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And so having that
self-awareness,

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:84%
though, is what
allowed you to do it.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Most people that enter
into these situations

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
are not necessarily
already self-aware.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.657 align:middle line:84%
It just sounds like a
good idea-- like you.

00:12:23.657 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a
good idea at the time

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:90%
and then you learn from there.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I love what you
had to say about that.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:90%
It is a path to self-mastery.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
challenging, probably

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.285 align:middle line:84%
the most challenging
path anyone could take.

00:12:35.285 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: It's the
ceremony that doesn't end.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't matter if
you're in a human body with all

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:90%
the normal human traits.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for sharing that.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Now how did that
lead to a car wreck?

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Well
ultimately I was pulled

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:90%
in so many different directions.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'd gotten
myself into a place--

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I had two paramours at
the time and as well

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:90%
as my primary partner.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was pretty much at
a place where everyone

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:90%
was frustrated with me.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: So there
was resentment.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:90%
I was surrounded by resentment.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I was surrounded
by the compensation

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.960 align:middle line:84%
for that resentment-- me trying
to provide more, offer more,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
divide my time, and
energy, and attention.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt like I was
putting all of this energy

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
to take care of everybody,
make everybody happy,

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
make this whole thing
work, holding it together.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
pulling me apart.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And while I don't
understand what

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:84%
happened from a materialist,
reductionist standpoint

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.130 align:middle line:84%
why I actually-- it was
the middle of the day.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I had a good sleep
and a nice smoothie.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was drinking a sparkling
water, drove out of my gate,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.790 align:middle line:90%
and completely blacked out.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Never blacked out before
one time in my life.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Something just shut
off the lights.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
I accelerated into a guardrail.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:84%
The guardrail cut
through the car, sliced

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:90%
through my face and my neck.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:90%
I was mangled.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I know I have a faint
memory of the Jaws of Life,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and I woke up in
the hospital and had

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.712 align:middle line:90%
to call my primary partner.

00:13:53.712 --> 00:13:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just
saying, like, I'm so sorry.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what happened,
but here I am in the hospital.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately what
happened from that--

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
which gave me clarity as to
why metaphysically I might have

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.100 align:middle line:90%
manifested that--

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:90%
was everybody came together.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.033 align:middle line:84%
My primary partner and
the other paramours--

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:12.075 align:middle line:84%
who all knew each other
and would see each other,

00:14:12.075 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:84%
but there was just resentment
and animosity, particularly

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:90%
towards me and each other.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:90%
They were all there.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were all like
lovingly taking care of me.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was
so desperate to feel

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
loved, and to feel nurtured,
and to feel cared for that I

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
created the most
dramatic way to do it,

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:84%
which is accelerating
my Tesla into steel.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's amazing
that you don't see scars.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.633 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: I was very lucky that
they had a plastic surgeon who

00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:90%
was on call--

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, you
were very lucky.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.397 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: --at the ER.

00:14:38.397 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:90%
And he was very good.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:90%
And he did a lot of work.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
young so all the collagen

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:44.164 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: I'm not that young.

00:14:44.164 --> 00:14:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It was three, 3
and 1/2 years ago.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll that's
still pretty young.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.995 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Young enough, 37.

00:14:47.995 --> 00:14:49.162 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's young skin.

00:14:49.162 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: For sure.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:90%
So you brought all the love in.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the fractured
situation you were in,

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
it all turned to love
to nurture you back.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:84%
What else did you discover
during that period of time?

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Well it only
lasted about two weeks.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:90%
That was the problem.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Because ultimately--

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You thought you
could milk it a little longer.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.967 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: --it's not
the right solution.

00:15:08.967 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to tell people out
if they're looking to get love,

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:12.730 align:middle line:90%
don't crash your car.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the short-term
solution for that.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean I think we have
to take care of ourself.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to be really
mindful of what we need.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we
overextend ourselves,

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.543 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the universe
is going to bench us.

00:15:27.543 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And that could be
an illness, that

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:84%
could be an injury,
that can be an accident.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like our soul, the guides,
whatever you want to call it,

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:84%
God, if you're comfortable
with that word,

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
the universe is going
to say, slow down,

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:90%
child, like slow down.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Like this is what
you really need.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that can be in
a really dramatic fashion.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So the more
awareness we can have

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and the more honoring of
ourself and our needs,

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
the less the universe is
going to have to intervene

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:90%
in its very dramatic ways.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.893 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, well,
thank god it only

00:15:55.893 --> 00:15:57.643 align:middle line:84%
lasted a couple of
weeks, and you came out

00:15:57.643 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
none the worse for
wear, which is great,

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
with a little extra
love under your belt.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:84%
We were talking off
camera about this.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.035 align:middle line:84%
Because as I said in
the opening, really

00:16:07.035 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:84%
you're exploring the
boundaries of what it is

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.320 align:middle line:90%
to be a man in today's world.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
The roles are no
longer what they were.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Those have been cast off.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Each person for themselves
to figure this stuff out now.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'm an observer.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I've always been an observer.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of an outsider.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:90%
So I just watch people a lot.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, trying to
go against human nature never

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:90%
bodes well.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:90%
It's like the polyamory thing.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
By and large, I think there's
a new show on Netflix where,

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:90%
same thing.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the woman starts
having a relationship

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:90%
with another guy.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And then she just says, OK,
he's the one and she's gone.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Because there has been this
imperative within women

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
gather, and nurture,

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:90%
and bond, and care for.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean that is whether--

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and through paths of
incarnation, if you're a male,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:90%
you have one directive.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
If you're a female, and both
have each of the other in there

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.870 align:middle line:84%
to one percentage
or another, there

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
are still classic kinds of
imperatives that happen.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And women generally
tend to want to bond

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and generally tend to
want to care or nurture.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:84%
Now for the first
time, I'm seeing it,

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:90%
it appears to be changing.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if it's
just appearances because

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
of the backlash of men coming
out from under patriarchy

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.735 align:middle line:84%
and honoring strong women
because they're there.

00:17:30.735 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:90%
They're graduating from college.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:90%
They're getting the top jobs.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Women are now out
there doing the things

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:90%
that men traditionally did.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
But on a
psychospiritual level, I

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
want to know your perception
of what that feels

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:90%
like from your own experience.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
raised to respect women

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and raised with
strong women, but now

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing toxic
femininity emerging.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Some really nasty, mean
behavior, horrible stuff

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:84%
coming out, which
you can understand

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:84%
after bursting out
from under patriarchy

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:90%
after thousands of years.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
That's a long way
to say, what's up?

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Yeah.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.103 align:middle line:84%
Well, every repressed action,
every action of repression,

00:18:12.103 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I should say, any time we're
trying to push something down

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
it's basically spring loading
a variety of different things.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And so you look at it and what
has been suppressed in men?

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Well men's femininity
has been suppressed.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Don't you cry.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Dry those tears.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Suck it up, bucko.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Like get back in there.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:84%
This kind of like you got to
be hard, you got to be strong.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.323 align:middle line:90%
So what's been suppressed?

00:18:34.323 --> 00:18:37.297 align:middle line:84%
Well that soft like it hurts,
and I just want to cry,

00:18:37.297 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:90%
and I want to share.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or hug.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Exactly.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's coming out.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing a
lot of men exploring

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
like a deep exploration
of their feminine side.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And on the female side,
what's been repressed?

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, that go get them, that I'm
going to go get the best job,

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:90%
do the best thing.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do everything
that I can to just conquer out

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:90%
That's been suppressed as well.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.412 align:middle line:90%
So you're seeing that rise up.

00:19:02.412 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
natural elements.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just those
elements that come,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.890 align:middle line:90%
there's the other aspects--

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.080 align:middle line:84%
the frustration, the
resentments, the angers--

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that are also coming
out in different ways.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really what we're seeing.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But where it's
heading, ultimately,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.280 align:middle line:90%
is we're finding equilibrium.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the pressure
is being released.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And as the pressure is
released, both positive aspects

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and toxic aspects are
springing forward.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
the necessary reaction

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
to go back and find
the balance as we

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
take the lid off
of everything, take

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.362 align:middle line:90%
all the spring loading off.

00:19:37.362 --> 00:19:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I think,
ultimately, we're

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:90%
going to find is real freedom.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Freedom to express not only
one aspect of the self,

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:90%
but the entirety of who we are.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Which is our birthright, we
should be able to both cry

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and then hold boldly
at the helm of a ship

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a storm,
and smile at the clouds,

00:19:55.470 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and say do your worst, and also
curl up in the fetal position,

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and have our head stroked
or stroke someone's head,

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:90%
and weep.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Both of those aspects,
the warrior and the poet,

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
this is where I began with my
podcast platform, the "Warrior

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Poet Project."

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
This idea of being both is,
I think, really important.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And for women the same,
that strong, loving, soft,

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
compassionate nurturer and
that ferocious mother lion.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:84%
All of those things should
be celebrated, revered.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:84%
What needs to be made aware
of is the repressed, still

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:84%
repressed aspects, those
shadow aspects of the anger,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.337 align:middle line:90%
what we call the toxicity.

00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Those things we're not aware of.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Those dark impulses.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's not further
repression of those,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
it's actually seeing
them, acknowledging them,

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:90%
loving that they exist.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually the love
that allows them to soften.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if you judge them,
then there's going to be shame.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And the shame is going
to obscure your view.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
remain in the shadow.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Whereas an acknowledged dark
impulse, you can manage,

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:84%
but something that's in
the shadow will manage you.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:90%
It will overcome you.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is your
own personal experience

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
that when the women who are
just now allowing the anger out

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.985 align:middle line:84%
after repression-- and
you can call it past life,

00:21:13.985 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
you can call it
ancestral memory.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really matter
where you look for it.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:90%
It's in the field.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Is your experience
that once the women

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:90%
feel they have permission--

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
big one with women--

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.530 align:middle line:84%
to be their worst,
give you their worst

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're still
standing there, does

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.395 align:middle line:84%
that seem in your observation
to have freed something in them?

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Absolutely.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have a very
personal experience

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:90%
with this with my wife Vylana.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:84%
She is the kindest,
sweetest, most loving woman

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:90%
I've ever known.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's really incredible.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But she has a dark,
Kali goddess aspect.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And it is absolutely
impressive, I have to say.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean I have never been
with someone who can--

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
when we would get in these
type of conflicts over nothing,

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.050 align:middle line:84%
really, she would find
a way to put me in a box

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.300 align:middle line:84%
where I couldn't say anything
because everything would

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:90%
turn right back around on me.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the box would
get smaller, and smaller,

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and smaller until I
was just floundering

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:90%
with nothing to say.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:90%
And then it was over.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:10%
And I was like I
just got dominated.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:10%
And so we had one of
these experiences.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And we took some space and
went our separate ways.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And she came back expecting--
she felt really guilty

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
about this, because she's aware
of that pattern, her ability

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:90%
to go to that level.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And she goes that was awful.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And I go, no, it wasn't,
that was awesome.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Like that was just
impressive that you were

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:90%
able to summon such a force.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just in awe that
you have that within you.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And you could just see all of
these years of shame soften.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And since that
moment, she's really

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
owned, and kind of
loved, and embodied

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.170 align:middle line:90%
that that's within her.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't had any
need to come out, not

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.640 align:middle line:90%
a single other time since.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.025 align:middle line:84%
It was the love and
reverence for that

00:23:02.025 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:84%
that allowed it to actually
move through and integrate fully

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:90%
into her.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.128 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a huge-- and
she would say the same thing,

00:23:09.128 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:90%
that was a huge moment for her.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So as we see this
in the collective,

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:90%
too, it's the same thing.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The more that we can
love instead of judge--

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
we have to protect
ourselves, I understand.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Have your boundaries.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless if
the undercurrent

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
of those boundaries is love,
and reverence, and respect,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.827 align:middle line:84%
that's what's going to
allow this thing to heal.

00:23:28.827 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I absolutely
agree with you.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And I remember over
the course of years

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
when I was trying to find a
relationship-- because I'm

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:90%
a bit of an oddball.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an easy fit.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of my secret wishes was
that I could just be my worst

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and someone would still
be standing there.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I am in that
relationship now.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.447 align:middle line:84%
My husband Zeus and I have
that, because he's like you--

00:23:54.447 --> 00:23:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: The right name for it.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, right?

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.540 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of electricity.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And again though but he's
secure enough and who he is

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:06.412 align:middle line:84%
as a person that to watch that
energy if we get in conflict

00:24:06.412 --> 00:24:08.620 align:middle line:84%
with each other-- because
I don't like being cornered

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:90%
so then I'll fight back--

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to watch that emerge
and at the end,

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.870 align:middle line:90%
he doesn't take it personally.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm shaken up when that
happens but he's not.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, good,
I'm glad you really

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:90%
got to express yourself.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very hard thing
to actually connect with,

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of men are very
intimidated by that ferocity.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Sure.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm a Metal Tiger in
Chinese, I guess you call it--

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:90%
not astrology, whatever it is.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And so someone hurts
someone I love,

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:90%
I will go and stand up for them.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.542 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of men are
very, very intimidated

00:24:46.542 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:84%
by that at this point still
because we haven't crossed over

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.610 align:middle line:84%
from the time where women
kind of cowered and waited

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:84%
for permission on subtle levels
that we don't even understand.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.468 align:middle line:90%
It's so embedded in us.

00:24:56.468 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's really up to the
guys to kind of stand up

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, gulp,
I can take it.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Yeah.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that ability to
look at any force of chaos,

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.645 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
chaos of nature,

00:25:06.645 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a virus,
or whether it's a person,

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's an animal and
have that awe, and reverence,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and respect without that
fear-based desire to dominate

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:90%
and control--

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.305 align:middle line:84%
which I think has permeated our
entire psyche and our culture.

00:25:20.305 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Ahh, there's danger and chaos.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Instead of respecting and
finding our accord with it

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and trusting ourself, we try
to dominate and control it.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's been
the impulse that we've had

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:32.720 align:middle line:90%
and continue to have.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And really what we
want to look at--

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
a great symbol, the symbol
I always look to is you

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.240 align:middle line:84%
look at any statue of Kali
or any depiction of Kali

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and she's got the severed
heads of the men representing

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
the egos that she's
destroyed, and severed arms.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And she's got her tongue out.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:90%
She's got her wild--

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:84%
they call her the dark
goddess with her wild hair

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:90%
and the bloody sabers.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And what's Shiva
doing, the expression

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.610 align:middle line:90%
of the divine masculine?

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:84%
He's just laying back
looking back at her

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:90%
like ain't she beautiful?

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Ain't she beautiful?

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's the divine
masculine-- hold all of it,

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%
every bit of it,
and just say, wow.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we can get
there allowing--

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and all of us can be
an aspect of that,

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:84%
but if we can allow
that to come forward,

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.355 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
healing, loving energy

00:26:19.355 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:90%
that the world needs.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.688 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
the women have

00:26:21.688 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to blow off steam
after thousands

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.695 align:middle line:90%
of years of this suppression.

00:26:24.695 --> 00:26:25.495 align:middle line:90%
They have to.

00:26:25.495 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear
from-- you have a lot

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:84%
of followers of your work, a lot
of people that engage with you.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:84%
What would you say is the
general theme of the men that

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:84%
are following your
work at this time?

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.152 align:middle line:84%
What are the
reflections from them?

00:26:41.152 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: I think
it's men that are

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:47.230 align:middle line:84%
interested in this
really robust life that

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:90%
doesn't put them in one box.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:84%
They're interested
in physical fitness.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:84%
They're interested in
performance out in business

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:55.750 align:middle line:90%
and in their life.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
interested in cultivating

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.670 align:middle line:84%
a true, felt,
experiential spirituality

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and cultivating those softer,
feminine elements as well.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
what I stand for.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I've planted my flag

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and talked about is the ability
to go to the extreme, like,

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.020 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I can mix it
up in a boxing gym,

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.060 align:middle line:90%
and I can go full out that way.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can also sit quietly in
a spiritual dieta in isolation

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:84%
for 21 days or in
six-day darkness

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.900 align:middle line:84%
retreat where it's just
me in the absolute silence

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.040 align:middle line:90%
in the black.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I can do both of those
things and celebrate

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:30.590 align:middle line:90%
both of those things.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the men, I
think, are feeling

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
free to actually live
their full birthright, live

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:84%
that ability to express
themselves in all that way.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think the greatest
gift that any of us can give

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.103 align:middle line:84%
is permission,
permission to exist.

00:27:44.103 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in a
sentence, what's

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:84%
their greatest collective
frustration that they're

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:84%
entering into engaging
with you and your work

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:90%
with the collective expression?

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: It's being
out of balance.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it's hard to say that
there's one particular avatar

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.700 align:middle line:84%
or archetype that
they're working with.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Some can't seem to
access that ability

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
to get their work
life in order or get

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.280 align:middle line:84%
their physical body in order,
but they're really in tune.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:84%
They got a regular
meditation practice,

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
have done plenty of plant
medicine ceremonies.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.398 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking
to get from me,

00:28:14.398 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:84%
hey, how do I get my
business plan together?

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:84%
How do I get my body
in the right shape?

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Other people, they've
got that figured out.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:90%
They know how.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:90%
They go to the gym every day.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:23.703 align:middle line:90%
They got a good job.

00:28:23.703 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they exited
from a company.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're like I just
really want to find--

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's
something missing.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:84%
My spiritual self is
craving and calling.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
called it balance.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:34.960 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for balance.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Balance.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for balance.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.813 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's trying to
find that equilibrium.

00:28:37.813 --> 00:28:40.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that brings us
to the subject of ayahuasca

00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:45.913 align:middle line:84%
and other psychotropic drugs and
what they bring to the table.

00:28:45.913 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:90%
I've done a few shows on it.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Ben Stewart is
one of the fellows

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.780 align:middle line:90%
that I've interviewed here.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.655 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: He's great.

00:28:50.655 --> 00:28:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
he's really good.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And so from your
perspective, when

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:84%
you started using
ayahuasca, what did you

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.910 align:middle line:90%
find it opened up in you?

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I've never
done ayahuasca.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:84%
I've done others-- I played
with other drugs ages ago--

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:84%
mushrooms, LSD, did
everything a couple of times.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But I have a very different
response to all of them.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have a real sense of
what other people experience.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
with you and others

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:26.760 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to these
kind of journeys you go on?

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Every interaction with
a different medicine is unique.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.730 align:middle line:90%
There are some similarities.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca in particular is an
incredibly profound healer.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:90%
So on one hand the DMT--

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.430 align:middle line:84%
which becomes orally active
through the combination

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
of the vine and the leaf
and how it's prepared,

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:90%
and then the lineage--

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that's going to immerse you
into this alternate reality,

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.470 align:middle line:84%
this other universe of
beings and a felt sense

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that I am in some
place that is very

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:84%
different from the
normal waking world.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And information is
available to you

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:84%
in a variety of different
ways through thoughts,

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:90%
through visions.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that's happening for
that four to seven hours,

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.070 align:middle line:84%
depending on how long
you're experiencing it.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you're
having a very physically

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.880 align:middle line:90%
purgative process.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So the tea, which
is called the brew,

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.250 align:middle line:84%
is moving its way
through your body.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're either
purging it through vomit

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.108 align:middle line:84%
or purging it through the
other end or sometimes both.

00:30:22.108 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:90%
They call that double platinum.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And I had a few episodes
of that where it's

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.430 align:middle line:90%
out both ends at the same time.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So as you're kind of getting all
of this information downloaded

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and this healing coming
through your psyche,

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:84%
awareness of past traumas,
awareness of areas where you

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.810 align:middle line:84%
may be out of alignment,
blessings from different beings

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.158 align:middle line:84%
that are there, perhaps
they're our own imagination,

00:30:42.158 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:84%
but they certainly don't feel
like it's our own imagination--

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.040 align:middle line:84%
far beyond what we
could conceptualize--

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:84%
these things coming
through, we're

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:84%
also getting the physical
healing from that process.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And that I think is
the beauty of ayahuasca

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:84%
in the right set, and setting,
with the right shaman.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it's ultimately a
very intense psychic surgery.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that's not for everybody.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's a challenging
process, but it can yield

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.822 align:middle line:90%
absolutely profound results.

00:31:11.822 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've always
wondered because it

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.450 align:middle line:84%
seems to me what's
happening is you're opening

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:90%
into other dimensional fields.

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But depending on the types
of entities, and animals,

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and such that
one's experiencing,

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
you don't know if you're going
into a lower dimensional field

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.240 align:middle line:90%
or a higher dimensional field.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And it can be a
combination of both.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even fair to
say high and low, different--

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Sure.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --more
elemental versus maybe

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.767 align:middle line:84%
more oriented toward
angelic, you would say.

00:31:38.767 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel
that they're entering

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.810 align:middle line:84%
more angelic realms, others more
elemental from what everybody

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:44.610 align:middle line:90%
tells me.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
happens, I know

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
from just alcohol and
drug use in general,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.450 align:middle line:84%
is we can really kind of
make our auras, our fields,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:90%
very permeable.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of
the reason people

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.350 align:middle line:84%
appear to be able to
move into other realms

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and connect with these
different entities is

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:90%
that exact permeability.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.530 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if
you're in the wrong hands?

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And I ask because
someone very dear to me

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:84%
had a very, very bad
experience in Ecuador

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.490 align:middle line:84%
with what appears to be
not a very nice shaman.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Yeah.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very bad, that
has lingering effects.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Well it's
the shaman's role.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.950 align:middle line:84%
What these maestros,
maestras, curanderos,

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
curanderas, what
they're trying to do

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.230 align:middle line:84%
is create a field,
a collective field,

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:31.380 align:middle line:84%
where those energies
from the outside

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.980 align:middle line:84%
aren't able to basically
penetrate this bubble.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So their job is
to essentially protect,

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.383 align:middle line:84%
to be alert because
they can see--

00:32:39.383 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:84%
they should be
able to see or they

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be doing this
job if they're not seers.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And they should be able to know
how to protect and ward off

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.500 align:middle line:90%
these entities.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: They hold the space.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's their job.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.072 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's very
much like their gunslingers.

00:32:51.072 --> 00:32:52.530 align:middle line:84%
You'll see them
with their mapacho,

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:90%
which is their sacred tobacco.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And they'll puff
and they'll go shhh.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
they're pushing,

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.250 align:middle line:84%
they're pushing out those
energies or entities

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:90%
out of the room.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And a really good
shaman will do that.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:84%
However, these darknesses
are within as well.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, finding
resonance with another.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Right.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So those things
can come up still

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.880 align:middle line:84%
from within because the
shaman can't immediately

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.220 align:middle line:84%
heal you and take all of
your darkness out of you.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So very often you will
encounter darkness.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain people
who, despite the great work

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.500 align:middle line:84%
of the shamans, if they have
too much darkness within

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and that darkness
is given license

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to emerge too fast because
of the ayahuasca process,

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.520 align:middle line:84%
there can be deeply challenging
experiences, psychoses,

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.093 align:middle line:84%
different things
that can come up.

00:33:37.093 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have to make sure that
your own darkness-- it would

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.850 align:middle line:84%
be like if you have poison
in your system but the poison

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:90%
is somewhat sequestered.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And you have something that's
going to melt that bubble

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and then all of the poison
is going to be released,

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.090 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to deal with that.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So you have to know that you're
really ready, that you're

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.690 align:middle line:84%
called to this, and that you've
done enough work to know what

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
your poison pain bodies are
that are going to release even

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:84%
despite the efficacy
of the shaman.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.560 align:middle line:90%
So that's one factor.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.070 align:middle line:84%
The other factor is maybe
the shaman isn't that good.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there are
other external entities,

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:84%
external forces, that are
able to enter the space

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and actually interact
with you in certain ways

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:90%
and create even more havoc.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
mindful of both

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.610 align:middle line:90%
of those different dangers--

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.679 align:middle line:84%
what you're carrying,
whether that's too much,

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:25.027 align:middle line:84%
and whether the shaman can
hold the collective space.

00:34:25.027 --> 00:34:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do people
avoid the pitfalls of getting

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:90%
in the hands of a bad shaman?

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: I talked
to one of the shamans

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that I've worked with,
Maestro Hamilton Souther,

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.139 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him
that very question.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the first step is
to look them deep in the eyes.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Like really trust your
instincts, your intuition.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We have this danger alert system
that maybe we don't trust it

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.730 align:middle line:90%
that well, but it's there.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:49.397 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well the
partner of the person

00:34:49.397 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking to at
the time thought,

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:53.187 align:middle line:90%
I do not like this shaman.

00:34:53.187 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: That's the sign.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.885 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter how
much you paid in advance.

00:34:56.885 --> 00:34:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how far you traveled,

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.750 align:middle line:84%
you get that feeling
and that's different

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:90%
from the normal resistance.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:84%
You're always going
to have a little--

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.070 align:middle line:84%
your hands are going
to get a little clammy

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
be like oh wow.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not like
having a bad weed dealer.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Right.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the difference between
on that climb up the roller

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:90%
coaster, right?

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.288 align:middle line:84%
You know that ch, ch,
ch, you're climbing up,

00:35:14.288 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a little apprehension.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's different
from this is dangerous.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.040 align:middle line:90%
This is a problem.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And you'll feel that.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.242 align:middle line:84%
And you got to trust That you
absolutely have to trust that.

00:35:24.242 --> 00:35:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good advice.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Otherwise,
you're going to likely deal

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.010 align:middle line:90%
with the consequences.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, it's
not just shamans.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to a surgeon,
like a physical surgeon

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.460 align:middle line:84%
with a scalpel, you get that
same feeling that he's not

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.160 align:middle line:84%
the right person and he's not
the one that you should be with

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:84%
or a cosmetic dentist,
doesn't matter.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Pull out of that situation.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Trust yourself.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.198 align:middle line:84%
Trust that there's
subconscious cues

00:35:49.198 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:90%
that you might not be aware of.

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:51.657 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fear of authority.

00:35:51.657 --> 00:35:53.580 align:middle line:84%
This is a human trait,
fear of authority.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: No doubt.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:54.707 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We say, yes.

00:35:54.707 --> 00:35:56.025 align:middle line:90%
We override our own feelings.

00:35:56.025 --> 00:35:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was very
good advice you just

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.990 align:middle line:90%
gave across the board.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Yeah.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very true.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think it could
have spared this person

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:84%
massive amounts of pain, years
of pain, had they listened.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Yeah.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And for anybody who's in that
position, like your friend,

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Maestro Alberto Davila,
who's one of the greatest

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.380 align:middle line:84%
shamans I've ever worked
with, he has a famous saying,

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:90%
we can fix anything but dead.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So know that whatever
has happened can be fixed

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:23.410 align:middle line:90%
and can be healed.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And you who you truly
are already healed,

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.510 align:middle line:84%
it's just getting
you back to the state

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.760 align:middle line:90%
of your natural being.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And one point that
people don't generally

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.515 align:middle line:84%
bring up, which is why I wanted
to talk to you about this

00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:37.960 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that you're calling
forth that own part of yourself

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that's unhealed or
disowned by you,

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:44.680 align:middle line:84%
which can call in resonant
forces of like energy.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's the two almost kind of
colluding and getting together

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.560 align:middle line:84%
to play something
out while you're

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:90%
in this very vulnerable state.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think what you
said is very valuable,

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:90%
and I thank you for that.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go beyond
psychotropic drugs.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.100 align:middle line:90%
And let's go to darkness.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.600 align:middle line:84%
You talked about this darkness
retreat that you went on.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to hear about
it in a little more detail.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what it's
like to be in the dark,

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.030 align:middle line:90%
what, for seven days?

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.033 align:middle line:90%
This was in Germany.

00:37:09.033 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: I ended up in
there for six days straight.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Six days.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Yeah, in Germany.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.060 align:middle line:84%
You know when I talk
about this, I've

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.680 align:middle line:84%
done a lot of
different things, this

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
was the thing that had
the most visceral reaction

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.450 align:middle line:84%
to people where they were
like, I would never do that.

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And you shouldn't
do that either.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.290 align:middle line:84%
People were projecting
their own fears onto me.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting because
all it is is less than.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.498 align:middle line:90%
I'm not adding anything.

00:37:31.498 --> 00:37:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually just
subtracting things.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm subtracting light
in its entirety,

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:90%
not a pinprick of light.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm subtracting experiences
with and interactions

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:40.600 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm completely alone.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And I'm subtracting sound.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.650 align:middle line:84%
You know silence,
darkness, and isolation,

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.780 align:middle line:90%
but that idea was terrifying.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But it was curious to
me why is that so scary?

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.590 align:middle line:90%
What are we afraid of?

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.173 align:middle line:84%
Because the only
thing to be afraid of

00:37:55.173 --> 00:37:56.620 align:middle line:90%
is what we have inside.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
a deep fear of what

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:84%
is in the recesses
of our own psyche.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.543 align:middle line:84%
And until we meet
that fear, we're

00:38:04.543 --> 00:38:06.460 align:middle line:84%
not going to actually
be able to transcend it.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.380 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
constantly in the shadows.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I liken it to
imagining that you're

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:84%
afraid of a monster
under the bed,

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:84%
but you never look
under the bed.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.265 align:middle line:84%
So every time you
get close to the bed,

00:38:15.265 --> 00:38:18.430 align:middle line:84%
you just dive onto the bed so
it doesn't nip at your heels.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did it progress
for you when you first went in?

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, obviously they fed you.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: They do.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And they feed you through
a blacked out hallway

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.430 align:middle line:90%
outside of the room.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:90%
They ring a little bell.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.890 align:middle line:84%
They mix up the times
that they feed you,

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.307 align:middle line:84%
so you don't know
what time it is.

00:38:31.307 --> 00:38:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But food would arrive
and you would get fed.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you had
the practical stuff.

00:38:36.425 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably
somewhere a toilet

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:90%
you can find your way to.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Toilet in there, yeah.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.652 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Basics covered.

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens
psychologically?

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Well you enter
into this alternate world.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:84%
You're out of the ordinary
world of life where you can see,

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and you can talk,
and you can listen.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.802 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
there with your mind.

00:38:51.802 --> 00:38:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And the mind starts scrambling
for problems to solve.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to try and
figure everything out.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.480 align:middle line:90%
It was not relaxing at all.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.490 align:middle line:84%
This was not a
relaxing experience,

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.260 align:middle line:84%
because the mind
goes into hyperdrive.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.180 align:middle line:84%
We like things to
distract ourselves.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like a rabid,
puzzle solving primate

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that's just constantly trying
to work the Rubik's cube of life

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:90%
but now--

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To stay in control.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:12.948 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: To stay in control.

00:39:12.948 --> 00:39:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what the mind does.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.660 align:middle line:90%
The ego likes to solve problems.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The conscious,
what we call conscious mind.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Sure.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.478 align:middle line:84%
So then the first
few days I just tried

00:39:21.478 --> 00:39:23.020 align:middle line:84%
to solve all the
problems in my life.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I determined that I
needed to move my house,

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:84%
change my job, leave all
my partnerships, move away.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I was like going to be
a swashbuckling pirate

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:32.780 align:middle line:90%
like sailing the seven seas.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.990 align:middle line:84%
It was just complete
fantasy about what

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I needed to do compared
to what was reality.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And then as time progressed--

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once
you tick the list off

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're a pirate on the
open seas, what was left?

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Exactly.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So but then, ultimately, I
realized as time progressed,

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.590 align:middle line:84%
my life is actually
perfect as it is.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And what's the challenge is
just getting a hold in my mind.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And the deep psychological
challenges of my mind

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:84%
was a fear of really living and
enjoying life to the fullest

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and loving the people in my
life, my partners, my mother,

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.220 align:middle line:84%
in particular, all of the
different relationships

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I had, really allowing
myself to surrender

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.930 align:middle line:84%
to that beauty and
that love, because I

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.520 align:middle line:90%
know that I have to give it up.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I know that time is going
to take all of this from me.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think a natural defense
mechanism that we all have is,

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:26.110 align:middle line:84%
well, if I don't really allow
myself to love it that much,

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.270 align:middle line:84%
when it goes away,
it won't hurt so bad.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're preparing ourself
for the disappointment

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and the challenge of letting
go instead of just living

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:84%
like that Warrior Poet that
I always strive to live for,

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.190 align:middle line:84%
which is to love and
to live as fully as

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:43.540 align:middle line:84%
possible despite the fact
that we have to let it all go.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How was it for
you in terms of just--

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.970 align:middle line:84%
could your mind let go
enough to even sleep?

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean did you
have sleep cycles?

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.185 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: So at the start
you do sleep quite a bit,

00:40:53.185 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:84%
because it's dark all the
time and you're sleeping.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And I had my aura ring on so
I was measuring my sleep even

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.710 align:middle line:90%
though it was dark.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:01.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was sleeping pretty good.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And then an interesting
thing happens.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.225 align:middle line:84%
There's an endogenous
release of DMT

00:41:05.225 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:84%
that occurs around
night three to five.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:08.985 align:middle line:84%
For me it's happening
around night three.

00:41:08.985 --> 00:41:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Such as
with ayahuasca.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Exactly.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's just
coming from within.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I started to enter the
vision space around day three

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and had incredibly potent
visions incessantly

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:90%
for the next three days.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, I
was sleeping four hours,

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:84%
three hours, finally two hours
a night of very light sleep

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:84%
because I was immersed
in this visionscape.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What were the visions?

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:35.500 align:middle line:90%
What were they showing you?

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.090 align:middle line:84%
What was the nature
of some of them?

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:39.007 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Yeah, all kinds
of different things.

00:41:39.007 --> 00:41:41.620 align:middle line:84%
One really clear,
lucid vision that came

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:90%
is I was really in a down state.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of challenging
emotions and repressed emotions

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:90%
were coming up.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this vision of a
golden Buddha come to me.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was just smiling with
the most effervescent smile.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up to
him in my despondency

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Buddha,
why are you smiling?

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And Buddha goes, why
aren't you smiling?

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.430 align:middle line:90%
I was like, Oh, I get it.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good question.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Yeah.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:90%
And then he started laughing.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Buddha,
why are you laughing?

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Buddha says, why
aren't you laughing?

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.845 align:middle line:84%
And then we just looked at each
other and I said, OK, I get it.

00:42:17.845 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:19.845 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: It was
really beautiful.

00:42:19.845 --> 00:42:21.637 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's simple,
cuts to the chase.

00:42:21.637 --> 00:42:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Kind of nothing else
really matters after that.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Exactly.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And there was
nothing else to say.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like I understood
the transmission.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And we just held each other in
that vision gaze for a while.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.410 align:middle line:90%
That was a powerful vision.

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I saw a vision of my
father that allowed

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.900 align:middle line:84%
me to unpack some really deep,
deep emotional issues that he

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.600 align:middle line:84%
had gone through in his life
in a transmission from him.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I had interactions
with different friends

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and different people in my life.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:84%
It was really, really
potent experience.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And I learned to be
curious about how

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.160 align:middle line:84%
to work with those energies
that were coming in

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and really interact with them
in a more interactive way

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.790 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
completely surrendering

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:06.568 align:middle line:84%
and waiting, but getting more
curious, having conversations.

00:43:06.568 --> 00:43:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beautifully
transformative.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:08.910 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: It was amazing.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.380 align:middle line:90%
So you've done that.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:11.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You ticked another
thing off the list.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.620 align:middle line:10%
What's the next
challenge, Aubrey,

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.840 align:middle line:10%
before we say goodbye here?

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.560 align:middle line:10%
>>MARCUS: I just want to live
the way that I recognized

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.860 align:middle line:10%
I could live when I
took my blindfold off

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.350 align:middle line:10%
and let the light in at the
end of that darkness retreat.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just had such a
raw, blissful appreciation

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:31.550 align:middle line:90%
for every aspect of my life.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
hug everybody so tight

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.670 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy every bite of food.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the first songs I
listened to, the first music, I

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.160 align:middle line:84%
was like, oh my god, music, and
outdoors, and nature, and life.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to live in that
state, not just touch it,

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:49.810 align:middle line:90%
but live in it.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's my goal is to by
whatever means necessary,

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.320 align:middle line:84%
find ways to get closer
to living in that state,

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.617 align:middle line:90%
in that vibration.

00:43:57.617 --> 00:43:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.130 align:middle line:90%
What about kids?

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Yeah, coming.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: Coming.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.937 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kids coming.

00:44:02.937 --> 00:44:04.420 align:middle line:84%
There's going to
be the next one.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:90%
That's your next challenge.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Whole new world.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.472 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS: No doubt.

00:44:08.472 --> 00:44:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for joining us and sharing

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:84%
with our audience what it is,
the journey to be a man today.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact that you're
so open with your personal

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:22.043 align:middle line:84%
experiences allows other
people to feel more comfortable

00:44:22.043 --> 00:44:23.710 align:middle line:84%
with the things they're
struggling with.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know that's
the beauty of what you do.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.398 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to say
thank you for that.

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:29.023 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS: Yeah, it
was a real pleasure.

00:44:29.023 --> 00:44:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:31.510 align:middle line:10%
