>>REGINA MEREDITH: Few people
have captured our imaginations

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:10%
in the modern era of film more
than the late Marilyn Monroe.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Her life was made more
beguiling and mysterious due

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to the circumstances
of her death

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and rumored involvement
with the Kennedys.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Filmmaker Paul Davids
is with us today

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the string of data
that shows the smoking gun may

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
have involved CIA
secrets carelessly

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:84%
divulged by JFK during
pillow talk with Marilyn.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
To me this is a really
interesting story,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
story of someone

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.984 align:middle line:84%
who really unwittingly became
a pawn in a very large game.

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:05.025 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL DAVIDS: It's the
subject of my new movie--

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:08.089 align:middle line:84%
>>BOTH: "Marilyn
Monroe Declassified."

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have
a lot of other films.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.579 align:middle line:90%
You are a prolific filmmaker.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
We've already talked to
you about the film "Jesus

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.514 align:middle line:90%
in India."

00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:84%
You have another one
about the afterlife

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:90%
we'll be talking about later.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of really
fabulous-- and all of them

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:90%
are kind of edgy-- films.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.015 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Can we mention, for
example, "Roswell" for Showtime

00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:90%
was one of the first.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.473 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
"Roswell" for Showtime.

00:01:29.473 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And this story is going
to start weaving back

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:90%
into this story of Marilyn, too.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: There's a connection.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So thank you
for bringing that up.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's paint
a picture of the times

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:84%
that all of this was
set in, because I

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:84%
think people, especially younger
people today watching this,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:84%
don't understand what was going
on in the '60s politically,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:84%
socially, and so forth, that
set this whole scenario up.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVIDS: Well, the
'60s, the early '60s,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:10%
marked the end of Marilyn
Monroe's fabulous career.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:10%
She died August 4, 1962.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:10%
Officially they say
the 5th because that's

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:10%
when the death was reported.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence is she
passed away on the 4th.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:90%
John F. Kennedy was president.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
She had been close
to John F. Kennedy

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
since before he got the
Democratic nomination

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:90%
to run for president in 1960.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Her career was amazing.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:84%
She started life, really,
raised in an orphanage

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.627 align:middle line:84%
and in foster homes, nine
different foster homes.

00:02:35.627 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was even
contention over her actual name

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and the name on her
birth certificate.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yes.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
She was born Norma
Jeane Mortenson,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and then she was often
called Norma Jeane Baker.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:84%
There was a question
about the father.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Her mother was a film editor at
RKO Studios, the studios that

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:84%
brought us "King Kong" and a
lot of other great classics.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So she was raised in
Hollywood and surrounded

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.440 align:middle line:84%
by all of the excitement
and glamor of the movie

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:90%
stars of those days.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Her career began to have its
beginnings in the late 1940s.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%
And then she did--

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was just a girl.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yeah.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, teenager.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yeah.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And she was singled out when
John Huston, the great director

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and actor, hired her for a part
in his classic "The Asphalt

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Jungle."

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
It was her first role
where people really

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:90%
took notice of her.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
She was in a great
string of comedies,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
"How to Marry a
Millionaire," "Bus Stop."

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
My favorite, I think,
is "Some Like It Hot."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think mine, too.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It's wonderful.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.141 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And, of course,
"The Prince and the Showgirl"

00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:84%
they made a movie, "My
Week with Marilyn,"

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:84%
which was about the filming of
"The Prince and the Showgirl."

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
a wonderful film.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.091 align:middle line:84%
That was out about five
years ago, I think,

00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:00.767 align:middle line:90%
four or five years ago.

00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: You mean
it was re-released?

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the "My Weeks with Marilyn."

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, with
Eddie Remayne, I think.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.066 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: It was a stunning
performance by Eddie Redmayne.

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it really was.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: So again, along the
way she had several marriages.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.391 align:middle line:84%
The first marriage
was to Jim Dougherty.

00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's
talk about that.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Most people have never heard
of Jim Dougherty in this story.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the circumstances

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:84%
she was living in that
necessitated that marriage.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, first of all,
I think she was around 16 years

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And she would have been
sent back to the orphanage

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
if she hadn't gotten
married instead.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Because the foster family she
was with was moving back East,

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't going to work
for them to take her with them.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But Jim Dougherty was
sort of a boy next door

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
in the neighborhood, and the
marriage happened very quickly.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But he joined I think it
was the Merchant Marines.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And then he was gone.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
They really didn't
have a marriage.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:90%
She lived with his mother.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And then she began taking
modeling jobs, got an agent.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.554 align:middle line:84%
She was appearing on the
cover of various magazines.

00:05:14.554 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Should we take a
peek at some of the clips

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.850 align:middle line:90%
from her very early years?

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: OK.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that OK?

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.216 align:middle line:90%
We lifted it from your film.

00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a quick peek.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Every major female
pop icon, they all

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:90%
go through their Marilyn phase.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Because Marilyn has
stimulated their imaginations

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and their image, and it's
quite extraordinary the way

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.240 align:middle line:90%
they all copy Marilyn.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
She created something that
touches something very deep.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a fresh,
beautiful young woman.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But you knew from her
background she wasn't one

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that you should leave
alone for too long, right?

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, she got
the interest of an agent.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And so she started to
get the small parts.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
She also had an offer to pose,
pin-up, for a nude calendar.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:90%
And she received $50 for it.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
It was the Golden Dreams
calendar, became very famous.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:84%
It sold millions of copies, more
than any other pin-up calendar

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there was
just something about her,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about that
in a little bit, yeah.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: But she was putting
her future career in jeopardy

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
by posing nude for that, because
it wasn't done at that time

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:90%
by studio actresses.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered later that
that was Marilyn Monroe.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Because at that point, really,
people didn't know her.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just a girl.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It caught up with her.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:84%
The marriage to Jim
Doughterty ended

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:90%
I think after a few years.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.156 align:middle line:84%
And then along came
baseball great Joe DiMaggio.

00:06:48.156 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, where
did "Playboy" figure in?

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Because we just read, of
course, "Playboy" is no longer

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:90%
going to be doing total nudes.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And she was the cover
of the very first "Playboy."

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:56.889 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The first one.

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And the Golden Dreams
shot was the first centerfold.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- they didn't call
it "centerfold" in those days.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the
"Sweetheart of the Month"

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.711 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
"Playboy" has abandoned

00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
that that because they said
almost every sex act available

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.519 align:middle line:90%
is one click away.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's do something
a little classier.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, they
consider nudity passe.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But in those days, of course,
it was forbidden territory.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:90%
It was very risque.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And Hugh Hefner got a hold of
the rights to that calendar

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
pose after it had
been disseminated.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.831 align:middle line:84%
And he used it for the
first "Playboy," as we said.

00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So he came into the
picture a little bit--

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Smart move.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: --a little bit later.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --on his part
to launch that magazine.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It helped make him.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And he
finds Marilyn Monroe

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:84%
so endearing and important
to his own career

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.395 align:middle line:84%
that he's purchased the
crypt right next to hers.

00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
didn't know that.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It's in Westwood.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.855 align:middle line:84%
He's going to spend
eternity next to her.

00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:54.240 align:middle line:90%
He talks about that.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:84%
If not her soul, at least
her bones. [CHUCKLING]

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: But along comes Joe
DiMaggio, the great baseball

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:90%
player.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.292 align:middle line:84%
And when she met
him, she didn't know.

00:08:04.292 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:84%
She heard he was
a great sportsman.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.630 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know if he was a
baseball player or a football

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.466 align:middle line:90%
player.

00:08:08.466 --> 00:08:09.375 align:middle line:90%
It was ridiculous.

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not to make her
sound like she's a dumb blonde,

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:90%
because she was not dumb.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.416 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: She was not.

00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, early in her
career, they often

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:90%
cast her as the dumb blonde.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:90%
And she was actually brunette.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:90%
The platinum bleach-blonde--

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
cultivated later.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.861 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: That was part of
her Marilyn Monroe character

00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:90%
that she created.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.875 align:middle line:84%
She said it takes a smart
brunette to play a dumb blonde.

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very funny funny.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: She
married Joe DiMaggio,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't know much
about his baseball career.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:90%
He hadn't seen her movies.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was a strange match.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:90%
But it was a storybook romance.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was in
all of the newsreels.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He loved her.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: He did.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
He proved that with
his devotion to her

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:90%
even after they were divorced.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Because the marriage
didn't work out.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.302 align:middle line:84%
They loved one another,
couldn't live together,

00:08:59.302 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:90%
couldn't be husband and wife.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:90%
But the love never died, really.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:84%
When they separated, this is
where her life really began

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:90%
to get complicated, Regina.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Because her next husband
was Arthur Miller,

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.209 align:middle line:84%
a Jewish playwright, one
of America's greatest--

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very political.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: --greatest
playwrights, "The Crucible,"

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:90%
"Death of a Salesman."

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
He wrote "After the Fall" about
his relationship with Marilyn.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And he was portrayed in that
"My Week with Marilyn" movie.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be a
very stormy marriage.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:84%
But he was a leftist,
a communist sympathizer

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:84%
in those days, if not
an actual communist.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.215 align:middle line:84%
But those were the days of the
House Un-American Activities

00:09:49.215 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Committee.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And you asked about painting
a picture of the era,

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and this is the era
that we get to that it's

00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:84%
so important to understand
what she got caught up in.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Because through her
marriage to Arthur Miller,

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:84%
she caught the
attention of the FBI.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:90%
They were watching him.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
He was subpoenaed to testify
before the House Un-American

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Activities Committee
and asked to name names.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.650 align:middle line:90%
He didn't.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:90%
He was found in contempt.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:90%
He might have gone to jail.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
The contempt charge
was reversed.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But the surveillance of
Marilyn and Arthur Miller,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:84%
the tapping of the phones,
spying on them from the FBI.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Who were their friends?

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
They associated with a lot
of leftists in that era.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.737 align:middle line:84%
She went to Mexico
with Freddie--

00:10:44.737 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Part of
the Vanderbilt clan.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Vanderbilt. Yeah.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.265 align:middle line:90%
And he was a communist.

00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I
think he'd been disinherited

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.990 align:middle line:90%
by the Vanderbilts.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:90%
So why was she doing this?

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she was political.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And she did have some
leftist leanings.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was very sympathetic
toward causes like integration

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
in those days, which the
communists were promoting.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:84%
The blacks and the whites
shouldn't be separated.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
They should be able to live
in the same neighborhoods.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, she'd been
through enough suffering.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.562 align:middle line:84%
She probably had a very
open kind of heart.

00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Well, yes, she did.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.311 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For
suffering of all kinds.

00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, as an
orphan and as somebody

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:90%
who was impoverished.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
She very, very much
sympathized with people

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
who had those kinds
of disadvantages.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Those leanings and
those philosophies

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
caused her to be under
the eye of J. Edgar

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Hoover, then head of the FBI,
and the Central Intelligence

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:84%
She even was noticed by the
head of counterintelligence

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA, James Angleton,
who is a man-- you didn't

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.340 align:middle line:90%
want to be on his radar screen.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she
was on all of them.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.665 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: She was
on all of them.

00:12:02.665 --> 00:12:04.984 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Her phones
were tapped, everything.

00:12:04.984 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: She was such
a sensation, of course.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:84%
When she spoke,
the world listened.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And her marriage to
Aurthur Miller did fail.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And she met John F.
Kennedy-- John F. Kennedy.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so just going
again on this theme of it

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.870 align:middle line:84%
takes a smart brunette
to play a dumb blonde,

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like she was a
fairly avid reader, enjoyed

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare, enjoyed of
variety of types of music.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Some were classically inclined.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.065 align:middle line:90%
She was not a--

00:12:38.065 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: We've got a picture
of her reading James Joyce.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, James Joyce.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: One of the
most difficult books

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:90%
in the English language.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So Marilyn is not what people
what she portrayed herself

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people think, why

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.070 align:middle line:84%
would someone as brilliant
as John F. Kennedy

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and also Arthur Miller
hang out with a ditz.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a part that a lot
of people wouldn't get.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:90%
They can't be that dense.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: The ditz was a
character that she created.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:90%
It's like Lucille Ball.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Was Lucille Ball--

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was very savvy
businesswoman and actress.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.256 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Of course she was.

00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But she played a
dingbat hair-brain.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And the character she
created in "I Love Lucy"--

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just
saying that to note this

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.400 align:middle line:84%
was a woman with intelligence
and passion and conviction.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, who
created a character.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.419 align:middle line:90%
So Seymour--

00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So now she's met JFK.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Seymour Hersh.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.994 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about who introduced her

00:13:29.994 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:90%
because this plans in again.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Sure.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say some of
this is covered-- of course,

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
we deal with all of this in my
film "Marilyn Declassified."

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
"Declassified," it's

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:84%
because that through the
Freedom of Information Act,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
declassified documents
from the FBI.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And a particular document
we have from the CIA

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
brings light to the dark
shadows of Marilyn's life

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't really
understand or know about before.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And it also leads us to a
lot of conclusions about how

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:90%
and why she died at age 36.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Because it was declared
officially a probable suicide.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.643 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to all
that in a moment.

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how she got there.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- let's get
into Kennedy, how she met him.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: She met him
through his brother-in-law,

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Peter Lawford.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.155 align:middle line:84%
And actually, he
hung out with her

00:14:27.155 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
at Peter Lawford's beach house,
but actually I take that back.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
Frank Sinatra that

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:90%
originally introduced them.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, Frank Sinatra is
a very important man

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
in this in the sense that
his mafia connections

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:90%
are very, very well known.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
He had a personal relationship
with Sam Giancana, the head

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:84%
mobster of the
Chicago syndicate,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:90%
who was a very dangerous.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Man he'd ordered a lot
of deaths, a lot of hits.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:90%
He was personally charming.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.914 align:middle line:90%
People that knew him--

00:15:02.914 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Charismatic, yeah.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.288 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: He was charismatic.

00:15:05.288 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
People that knew him
enjoyed his company.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:90%
He had a certain charm.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:90%
But he was a gangster.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And you had that connection
with Frank Sinatra,

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and you had John F.
Kennedy meeting Marilyn

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Monroe in this way.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Kennedy family
itself had these connections

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:84%
to the Mob that have been
documented as part of history.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:90%
They're not controversial.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the
father Joseph Kennedy.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Yet--

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.801 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: We need
to talk about that.

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do, and then
RFK going after the Mob, OK.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: So Joseph Kennedy,
his connections with the Mob

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:84%
go back to the bootlegging
days during Prohibition.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:90%
He was a bootlegger.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:84%
He made a lot of the
Kennedy fortune that way.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And when John F. Kennedy
was running for President,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.255 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Kennedy went
to Sam Giancana,

00:15:58.255 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
the head of the Chicago
Mob, and asked for his help

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:84%
in delivering Chicago in
Illinois into the Kennedy camp.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
He wanted help from Jimmy Hoffa,
the head of the Teamsters.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.220 align:middle line:84%
The Mob had a certain
influence there,

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and by getting the Teamsters'
endorsement for Kennedy,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
it helped ensure his
pathway to the White House.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And the argument, the
father, Joseph Kennedy,

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
made to Sam Giancana
was, you're going

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:84%
to be much better off with
a Kennedy in the White House

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:84%
than Nixon as far as the
persecution of the mafia.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Trust us.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a rather famous
book that's been written

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
called "Double Cross." by
Chuck Giancana, the brother,

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and another Sam Giancana, who's
a nephew, that really helps

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
us understand the
extent to which there

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.010 align:middle line:90%
was a double cross of the Mob.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
This is so important
for understanding

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:84%
the background that lays the
stage for putting together

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
the details of Marilyn
Monroe's death.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Because she was a pawn
on this chess board.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And the Mob did deliver
Chicago for JFK.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:90%
He won by a hair's breath.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And they expected
sort of payback.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, JFK assigned his
brother, appointed him

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:84%
attorney general,
Bobby Kennedy, RFK.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And RFK made it his mission
in life to go after the Mob

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.394 align:middle line:84%
and persecute them and prosecute
them and send as many--

00:17:45.394 --> 00:17:46.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
Jimmy Hoffa, too.

00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Send as many
to jail as he could.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:84%
In "Marilyn Monroe
Declassified,"

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
we paint the picture
of all of this history.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
They were called before
his Senate committee,

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Hoffa having to
testify, Sam Giancana

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
being accused of stuffing
his enemies in a truck.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So can you imagine the vendetta,
the atmosphere of anger,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:90%
resentment, double cross?

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
We put you in the White House,
was the attitude of the Mob.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:90%
And now you do this to us?

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you mess with the Mob that
way, your brother, Bobby?

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:90%
A curse on his head.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there is
something very cryptic that

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:84%
happened that is very famous
and people know about,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:84%
but they probably didn't
hear the intro to it

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
as giving, I don't know whether
it was a warning or what,

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:84%
about what they were going
to do to Marilyn Monroe.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And that has to
do a little bit--

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about it in a minute,
Peter Lawford introducing her

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
as she sang the famous
birthday song to President--

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, that
was in her last year.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:90%
It was the spring.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.209 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:54.209 --> 00:18:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: It was
either march or may.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.512 align:middle line:84%
But she died in
August, in months.

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
point is, I don't

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
know what Lawford's relationship
was, but was that a slip?

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's--

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: No, no, no.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:84%
What that was-- because he
introduces her as the late

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Marilyn--

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.021 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was just--
we were going to run that.

00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well,
she was backstage

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:90%
getting her makeup on.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:90%
She was becoming Marilyn Monroe.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The late
Marilyn Monroe.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: They announced
her a couple of times.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Here's Marilyn Monroe.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
here's the late--

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: She's not here.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.280 align:middle line:90%
She's not here.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.321 align:middle line:90%
And she finally shows up.

00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So she's introduced
as the late--

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look at that
clip, because it became very

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
cryptic later. [LAUGHING]
OK, people know it,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.220 align:middle line:84%
but let's look at
what happened here.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:10%
>>Her most famous
film appearance

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:10%
could well be when she sang
"Happy Birthday" to John F.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy, and that piece
of film is truly iconic,

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:90%
"Happy Birthday, Mr. President."

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.252 align:middle line:10%
>>Mr. President, the
late Marilyn Monroe.

00:19:49.252 --> 00:19:58.195 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:01.997 align:middle line:90%
>>(SINGING) Happy birthday--

00:20:01.997 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>To look at her
that night, you would

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:84%
think there was
absolutely nothing wrong.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:10%
You look at this
woman, who seems

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.110 align:middle line:10%
at the height of her
powers during that,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:10%
and now that we know in
retrospect that there

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:10%
was much more to
this relationship

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.041 align:middle line:10%
with the president,
it's quite interesting.

00:20:18.041 --> 00:20:18.841 align:middle line:90%
>>Everybody!

00:20:18.841 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Happy birthday!

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>They had to keep announcing
her, here's Marilyn Monroe,

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
here's Marilyn Monroe,
and they finally announce,

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:90%
here's the late Marilyn Monroe.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Six months later, she was
the late Marilyn Monroe

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.700 align:middle line:84%
because her death
happened in August.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:10%
>>It is my conclusion that
the death of Marilyn Monroe

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.900 align:middle line:10%
was caused by a
self-administered overdose

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:10%
of sedative drugs and
that the mode of death

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:10%
is probably suicide.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she was
dead within six months.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:84%
She did become the
late Marilyn Monroe.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: She did.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was soon after she sang
"Happy Birthday, Mr. President"

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that John F. Kennedy
felt he had to break off

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:90%
the relationship with her.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, Seymour Hersh, who wrote
the book, an excellent book,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:84%
called "The Dark
Side of Camelot,"

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:84%
he documents very accurately
through many interviews

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
the affair between John F.
Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:84%
They were sexually involved,
these two great icons

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:90%
of that era.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:84%
But JFK got the warning
from J. Edgar Hoover.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:84%
All of his various affairs
were being watched by the FBI.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And he assigned
his brother Bobby

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
to give him help
in going to Marilyn

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and making her
understand that it just

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
had to stop, these calls to
the White House switchboard,

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:84%
the expectation of visiting
the White House, the pressure

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:90%
that she was putting on him.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.711 align:middle line:90%
She did love him.

00:21:58.711 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she was
being rejected by him now.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.376 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: She was
being rejected by him,

00:22:02.376 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and she had a lot of rejection
from men in her life.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
When Bobby had to sort
of take over for Jack,

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.050 align:middle line:84%
he developed a relationship
with Marilyn Monroe.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how far it went.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:84%
At least we know it was
a very strong friendship.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was a letter written
sort of joking about the fact

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.870 align:middle line:90%
that they were now an item.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't know whether
they really were.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
But look at who she was
playing with at that point.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:84%
She's dealing with the most
powerful men in the world.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet she's associated
with Frank Sinatra

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.208 align:middle line:90%
and through him Sam Giancana.

00:22:37.208 --> 00:22:39.910 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And she shows up dead in August
after singing "Happy Birthday,

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Mr. President."

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we need to
really understand it.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:84%
We need to talk a little
more about Sam Giancana

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and how the CIA was using
him and the Mob at that time.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:90%
It's part of history.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It's well documented in many
books, including Seymour Hersh.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So Sam Giancana had been
enlisted to help the CIA get

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:90%
rid of Fidel Castro.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
It was a goal of the
Kennedy administration.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.010 align:middle line:90%
They wanted him eliminated.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:90%
They wanted him assassinated.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And when the CIA enlisted
the Mob to do that,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
to attempt that, it's an
arm's-length transaction.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if anything
goes wrong, it

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
reflects on the Mob, who
lost all their casinos when

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.479 align:middle line:90%
Fidel Castro took over.

00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:36.278 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:36.278 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Now wait a minute.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Was RFK or JFK
aware that the CIA

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:90%
was using Giancana in that way?

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.564 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: I'm sure that
Robert Kennedy was not aware.

00:23:48.564 --> 00:23:49.605 align:middle line:90%
Because it's documented--

00:23:49.605 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That makes a
difference at this point.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: --at the
point that he found out.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.389 align:middle line:84%
He was furious, because
he was trying to put

00:23:53.389 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Sam Giancana [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:90%
He was furious.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.310 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm wondering.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Absolutely furious.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But JFK had carried on a secret
relationship with Sam Giancana,

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:84%
seeking his help on many things
that required secret payoffs.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The go-between was a mistress
that they both shared.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Judith Campbell
Exner was a mistress

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
to JFK and at first a friend to
Sam Giancana, whose girlfriend

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:90%
was the singer Phyllis McGuire.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't looking for another
plaything at that time.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But eventually then
she was a mistress

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:84%
we think at the same time
for both of these men,

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.248 align:middle line:84%
the president of
the United States,

00:24:38.248 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
man in the world,

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:90%
and the most powerful Mobster--

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in the world
are sharing the same lover.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yeah.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's a fact.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So you had the FBI
and Robert Kennedy

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.440 align:middle line:84%
persecuting Sam Giancana,
sending agents after him,

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.117 align:middle line:84%
insulting him when he gets off
an airplane, shouting at him

00:24:57.117 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:90%
that he ought to be behind bars.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And he's not able to reveal the
fact he's working for the CIA.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Robert Maheu enlisted
him for Project Mongoose.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, they failed at
eliminating Fidel Castro.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.400 align:middle line:90%
That's history.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:90%
We know it didn't work.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But the establishment
of Sam Giancana

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
as the private,
right-arm elimination

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.570 align:middle line:84%
squad when the CIA needed
somebody taking care of,

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:90%
that was precedent.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.240 align:middle line:90%
That was known.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we get
to here, Regina,

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that there is
a confession in the murder

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:90%
of Marilyn Monroe.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.809 align:middle line:84%
The official story, as we
know, was a probable suicide.

00:25:35.809 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which, that's
not what's written.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: From overdose.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.375 align:middle line:84%
They don't usually
write "probable."

00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yeah, they
don't usually use the word

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:90%
"probable"-- almost never.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unless it looks like
it's headed toward a cover-up.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: There were
signs of a cover-up

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:90%
absolutely from the beginning.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The first minutes.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.453 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And I want
to say, for those

00:25:52.453 --> 00:25:55.280 align:middle line:84%
who are the doubters-- because
there are a lot of people that

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.080 align:middle line:84%
think that if it wasn't suicide,
it was an accidental overdose.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.426 align:middle line:84%
She had the drugs there,
she took too many.

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but the means
of administration of the drug

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:90%
and some of those--

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well,
there's evidence for--

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
we'll talk about it.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.733 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yeah, there's
evidence about that.

00:26:09.733 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing
I want to drive home

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
there are two police

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.730 align:middle line:84%
chiefs of Los Angeles
that made comments

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:90%
about this years later.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
One was Darryl Gates, who
established for us one

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.030 align:middle line:84%
of the debated points, that
Robert Kennedy was in Los

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Angeles the day of her death.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
testimony that he visited her

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:90%
that afternoon.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about what happened

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:90%
when we were stopped also.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Finish that one.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Before
we go there, I want

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
to say if he was at her
house that afternoon,

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.550 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of things
on the internet accusing

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Bobby Kennedy, or
both Bobby and John,

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:84%
of having been behind the
death of Marilyn Monroe.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.870 align:middle line:84%
There have been books
written about that.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Margolis and Buskin had
a recent book about that.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:90%
I do agree she was murdered.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I do not agree, as a
basis of my research,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:90%
that the Kennedys ordered this.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I think we can put the pieces
together a different way.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to bring
up the timing of all of this

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.200 align:middle line:90%
But let's go back to Giancana.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, there
were two points.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.397 align:middle line:84%
The one point was
that Darryl Gates

00:27:24.397 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:84%
said Bobby Kennedy was
there that afternoon.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:84%
The other one is that
Police Chief Thomas Reddin

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:84%
said that after she
died, it was treated

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:84%
as a high-level
intelligence operation.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, yes.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: This is the
most important point

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.850 align:middle line:84%
for those who want
to stick to the idea

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
that it was a suicide
or an accidental death.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.596 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wouldn't
be treated like that.

00:27:45.596 --> 00:27:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: They sent in a squad.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:10%
They knew that she was
deceased by somewhere

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.006 align:middle line:10%
probably between 9 or
10 o'clock on August 4.

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Why wasn't her death
reported until 3:30

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.367 align:middle line:84%
in the morning the
next day, the 5th?

00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And anywhere you
look on the internet,

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.170 align:middle line:90%
they say she died on the 5th.

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.160 align:middle line:90%
That's when it was reported.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:03.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:84%
We know there was six hours
where they cleaned things up.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:84%
The body was laid out
to look like a suicide.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.090 align:middle line:84%
All fingerprints in the
house were wiped down.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So Bobby Kennedy's
fingerprints wouldn't

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.090 align:middle line:84%
be found for having been
there that afternoon.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Reddin, police chief,
has established this for us.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And we know from Arthur
Jacobs, a publicist of Marilyn,

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:84%
who was at the Hollywood
Bowl the night of the 4th,

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:84%
he got the word about
Marilyn's demise

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:84%
before the concert he
was at was even over.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
He was a Henry Mancini
concert that night.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle line:90%
He's testified about this.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:90%
We've heard this.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So he got involved right after
the death, getting over there.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Her psychiatrist,
Greenson, got in there.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:54.790 align:middle line:90%
Peter Lawford got in there.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Peter Lawford went to a man
he didn't know had actually

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
wiretapped Marilyn's house,
Fred Otash, asking for help

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.490 align:middle line:90%
in cleaning up the place.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:09.030 align:middle line:84%
But Chief Reddin tells us
that a top-secret intelligence

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:12.510 align:middle line:84%
operation took care of
it, took care of business.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And then it was reported that
she was dead with a phone call

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.680 align:middle line:84%
from the psychiatrist to
a beat police Sergeant

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
at the station house who didn't
know what had been going on

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.040 align:middle line:90%
for the last six hours.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And he came in and is shown
the body, shown the pills.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is the beginning

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:90%
of the official story.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: That's
the official story.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, I was also
intrigued with the whole visit

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.420 align:middle line:90%
by RFK.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:84%
It said here that a
Lincoln Continental was

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.590 align:middle line:84%
seen driving away from our
neighborhood going 75 in a 25

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:90%
and was pulled over by a cop.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Peter Lawford was in the front.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.960 align:middle line:90%
RFK was in the back, right?

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.862 align:middle line:90%
18 eyewitnesses saw--

00:29:49.862 --> 00:29:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Bobby Kennedy
in town that day.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bobby Kennedy
in town that day.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And oddly, considering
his position,

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:90%
there were no police escorts.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:04.240 align:middle line:84%
No police were following him,
even though he was supposedly

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:90%
being watched by the FBI.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: He would usually
have bodyguards leaving town.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bodyguards
and so forth.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.512 align:middle line:90%
None of that was happening.

00:30:09.512 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: You see,
a lot of this is

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.460 align:middle line:84%
what causes there to be so much
suspicion that he was involved

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.021 align:middle line:90%
in causing her death.

00:30:16.021 --> 00:30:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he
was being followed.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.900 align:middle line:90%
He was tapped, she was tapped.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knew the
convergence of these events,

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.560 align:middle line:84%
that he was coming to say, you
gotta lay off, Marilyn, right?

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yeah.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But we get to the
most important point,

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
that there's a confession on
the table from Sam Giancana's

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:90%
relatives.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:38.400 align:middle line:84%
This is from Chuck Giancana
in the book "Double Cross"--

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and he's said this
publicly on television,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and the nephew Sam Giancana--
that Sam told them that he had

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn eliminated at the
behest, under contract,

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:52.950 align:middle line:90%
of the CIA.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where it gets
really, really interesting.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Sam Giancana, who hated Robert
Kennedy, sent in a hit squat,

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:84%
according to this
information, on a day

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that Robert Kennedy had
been there expecting

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.830 align:middle line:84%
that he'd kill two birds
with one stone, so to speak.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.119 align:middle line:84%
It's like blackmail or
cornering Robert Kennedy,

00:31:13.119 --> 00:31:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that the police
would come in, they'd

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.229 align:middle line:84%
find Robert Kennedy's
fingerprints.

00:31:17.229 --> 00:31:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Boy, wouldn't he have a tough
time explaining that one.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:84%
They might find
letters from him,

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Robert Kennedy,
correspondence with Marilyn,

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.650 align:middle line:84%
things that would tie
her to the Kennedys.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:90%
But all of that was cleaned up.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, we're told that
Sam Giancana chose that time.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.850 align:middle line:84%
He knew through wiretaps
Kennedy had been there.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:38.960 align:middle line:90%
And he sent in a hit squad.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:84%
There were people
like Johnny Roselli,

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:84%
a mobster in Hollywood, who
was a friend of Marilyn Monroe.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:84%
She would have opened
the door for him.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And there I've been
books written speculating

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.340 align:middle line:90%
who the actual hit team was.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:32:01.500 align:middle line:84%
You've got books by Milo
Sperilgio, such as "Crypt 33."

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:06.130 align:middle line:84%
There's two books by Robert
Slatzer, whose credibility

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.050 align:middle line:90%
has been questioned.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
the murder theory

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:84%
has been around with us
for a long, long time.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
then you get into-- we

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.720 align:middle line:84%
didn't talk about any
of the toxicity reports

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.470 align:middle line:84%
or what was said to be the
delivery system of the drugs

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.270 align:middle line:90%
potentially.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: There were
a lot of indicators

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that the official story of
swallowing too many pills

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.540 align:middle line:90%
didn't hold up.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.850 align:middle line:84%
They didn't find
undissolved pill capsules.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:84%
They did find a
discoloration of the colon,

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.880 align:middle line:84%
a purplish discoloration
indicated in the autopsy report

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that would indicate the
possibility of a suppository

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:48.960 align:middle line:84%
injection that hit the colon of
a high does of a barbiturate.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.210 align:middle line:84%
They also found chloral
hydrate in her blood,

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.070 align:middle line:84%
which she might have taken that
afternoon just as prescription

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But you mix chloral hydrate
with Nembutal, and you're dead.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And you're dead.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they would have
known whatever prescription

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.140 align:middle line:90%
drugs she was on theoretically.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Sure.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So now, one of
the things I think

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:84%
is unique about my film "Marilyn
Monroe Declassified" in the way

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:84%
it ties all of this together
is the likely answer is

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.610 align:middle line:84%
it addresses Sam
Giancana's claim

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.170 align:middle line:84%
that the CIA had
put him up to this.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.390 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely
interesting that there

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:84%
is a document from the CIA,
signed by counterintelligence

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Chief James Angleton
the day before she died,

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:42.720 align:middle line:84%
August 3, that indicates
what the wiretaps have been.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.800 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's wiretaps of
Dorothy Kilgallen, who Marilyn

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:84%
knew and talked to, where
Marilyn had spilled the beans

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:55.330 align:middle line:84%
on some things in talks
with Dorothy Kilgallen that

00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:00.130 align:middle line:84%
were classified that Marilyn
shouldn't have known.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA sees from Dorothy
Kilgallen's conversation

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.960 align:middle line:84%
that this information
is being passed around,

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:84%
that Marilyn is
disgruntled, that she's

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
considering going public,
holding a press conference.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what
she's going to say?

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the decision,
as Sam Giancana claims,

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:84%
had been made that they
had to eliminate her,

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.780 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't take the risk
of this classified information

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.800 align:middle line:90%
being released.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.909 align:middle line:84%
They were more concerned
about that, apparently,

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:32.810 align:middle line:84%
than exposing the
Kennedy affair.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.135 align:middle line:84%
They were there protecting their
own turf and their own secrets.

00:34:36.135 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So if that letter
from the CIA has

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.969 align:middle line:84%
the import that
we think it does,

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:47.980 align:middle line:84%
then it's very strong
evidence that Sam Giancana's

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.929 align:middle line:84%
confession it is true that he
got the contract from the CIA.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a document
that shows what the CIA

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.537 align:middle line:84%
motivation would have
been for hiring him again,

00:34:58.537 --> 00:34:59.870 align:middle line:90%
like he was hired to deal with--

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: The
pieces fit together.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.560 align:middle line:84%
The signature of James
Angleton on the document-- I'm

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
not a signature expert
in this, but looks good.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:84%
There are very few examples of
that signature you could find.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.100 align:middle line:84%
We certainly found
one we could compare.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So people ask, well,
is that document real?

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.262 align:middle line:84%
Because they dismissed
it for a lot of reasons.

00:35:22.262 --> 00:35:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And we want to go into
that, because some of it

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.480 align:middle line:84%
involves actually
the information she

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.780 align:middle line:90%
knew that had to do with UFOs.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
there's a soundbite here

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that we have that has
to do with a visit

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:90%
by JFK to a secret airbase.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know in other shows
that I and other people

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.330 align:middle line:84%
here have done this is
not the first time we've

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:45.230 align:middle line:84%
heard that JFK was in support
of various secret space programs

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.150 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Can we listen to
that particular part

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:48.958 align:middle line:90%
of the documentary for a sec?

00:35:48.958 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Sure.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>What was the top-secret event
that JFK told Marilyn about?

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:58.960 align:middle line:10%
This really implies
something devastating.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It implies that the
Roswell incident,

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.520 align:middle line:84%
the UFO crash, the famous,
legendary crash, occurred.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And JFK is telling
Marilyn Monroe about it.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.020 align:middle line:84%
The CIA is bugging this
conversation and freaking out.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Did this really happen?

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, certainly the newspapers
of the day said it did.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And TV reports even now
still report this as fact.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[INAUDIBLE] document claims
Marilyn's wiretap recorded

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:84%
her describing the
visit by the president

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.870 align:middle line:84%
to a secret airbase for the
purpose of inspecting things

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:90%
from outer space.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.290 align:middle line:10%
A reference in Mexico
in the late 1940s

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.020 align:middle line:10%
points straight to
the Roswell incident.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.890 align:middle line:10%
This document was written
and presumably distributed

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:45.030 align:middle line:10%
on August 3, 1962.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.177 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now,
it's been said even

00:36:48.177 --> 00:36:50.510 align:middle line:84%
in other interviews I've done,
other research I've done,

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:84%
JFK was aware of a secret space
program and various things.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.970 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't in a
need-to-know position,

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:84%
but he asked a lot of
questions, and he did

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.990 align:middle line:84%
have apparent
involvement in some

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:06.180 align:middle line:84%
of these programs, these
off-planet culture,

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.460 align:middle line:90%
UFO, ET programs.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Regina, that
tapped conversation

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.600 align:middle line:84%
with Dorothy Kilgallen,
she's indicating

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.970 align:middle line:84%
she thought the secret
airbase visit was related

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to the crashed flying saucer
incident in the Southwest,

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:24.850 align:middle line:84%
the Roswell incident of 1947,
that it actually was real

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and that JFK had tipped
off Marilyn about that.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if you
read Philip Corso's work,

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and you know him,
after Roswell we

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.970 align:middle line:84%
know that all of that
material was brought up

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
for physical review
and parted out

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.460 align:middle line:84%
for development during the
Kennedy administration.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: I think
that-- I've often

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:47.130 align:middle line:84%
asked myself the
question, why did I delve

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.959 align:middle line:90%
so deeply into this mystery?

00:37:48.959 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you've done
this Roswell documentary.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.416 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: That's part of it.

00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I was the executive producer and
co-writer of a very famous film

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:90%
called "Roswell."

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:06.490 align:middle line:84%
In the DVD or VHS, they called
it "Roswell, the UFO Cover-Up."

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It was with Kyle MacLachlan of
"Twin Peaks" and Martin Sheen,

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Dwight Yoakum were
all in this movie.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.210 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a documentary.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It was a dramatic
film for Showtime.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of
making the movie, of course

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I got to speak to all the
people, many of them now

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:28.130 align:middle line:84%
deceased, but down in Roswell,
who were there at the time.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And all reinforced that
the UFO crash was real,

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that the government story
about it was fiction.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard it
from enough people

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.320 align:middle line:84%
to be convinced absolutely
that the government story, all

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.199 align:middle line:84%
of them, the Mughal
balloon, the crash

00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:45.990 align:middle line:84%
dummies-- every time
the Pentagon comes out

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.640 align:middle line:84%
with another report,
they're digging themselves

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.854 align:middle line:84%
in a little deeper as
far as I'm concerned.

00:38:51.854 --> 00:38:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the
information officer

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.630 align:middle line:84%
finally admitted, he said, I
was told to tell that story.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Listen,
I had the privilege

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to hear it from astronaut
Gordon Cooper, first to circle

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:03.600 align:middle line:90%
the Earth in orbit.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.183 align:middle line:84%
He called me to a meeting after
he saw the movie, and he said,

00:39:06.183 --> 00:39:07.230 align:middle line:90%
you got it right.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And then Edgar Mitchell, who's
walked on the moon, personally

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.670 align:middle line:84%
told me why he believed
that the ET crash

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:90%
story is absolutely true.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So the information is
probably still classified.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the CIA
document we're talking about

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
in the movie about Marilyn
Monroe is legitimate,

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.320 align:middle line:84%
not just because of the
signature similarity of James

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Angleton, but because
the researcher,

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.410 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a book called "UFOs
and the Murder of Marilyn

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Monroe"-- his name
is Don Burleson--

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.400 align:middle line:84%
took that document and with
Freedom of Information Act

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:46.820 align:middle line:84%
request, he said, look,
it refers to wiretaps

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.780 align:middle line:90%
of Marilyn's phone.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.170 align:middle line:84%
There must be transcriptions
of the wiretaps.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm requesting the
transcriptions,

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Freedom of Information.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.920 align:middle line:84%
CIA says, look, we
looked for this.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:90%
We can't find it.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to appeal,
here's the process to appeal.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.450 align:middle line:84%
You have to do it
within 30 days.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:08.090 align:middle line:90%
So he files an appeal.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.990 align:middle line:84%
On the basis of
that document, you

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:14.700 align:middle line:84%
see, that explosive document
that is so important,

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and they accept the appeal
on the basis of the document.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, as Don Burleson has
so pointedly explained,

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.550 align:middle line:84%
the CIA wouldn't accept a
request like that on appeal

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:30.850 align:middle line:90%
if the document was bogus.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, yeah.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: When we had this
question about the MJ-12

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.780 align:middle line:84%
documents, the
Majestic documents,

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and it went to the
FBI for confirmation,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.910 align:middle line:84%
they sent it back to the
requester with the word "Bogus"

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:48.290 align:middle line:84%
written, big letters
on the top of the page.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:53.280 align:middle line:84%
The CIA never disclaimed
this document as being bogus.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:59.220 align:middle line:84%
If it's real, what it tells
us is the day before Marilyn's

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.420 align:middle line:84%
death, the head of CIA
counterintelligence

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:05.050 align:middle line:84%
was aware that she was talking
about things she shouldn't even

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.180 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Things having to
do with JFK's understanding,

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:84%
awareness, or
involvement in some

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.752 align:middle line:84%
of these kinds of confidential
programs, Black Ops,

00:41:16.752 --> 00:41:17.960 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yes.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:84%
When I asked,
Regina, when I said

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I've often asked myself, how
did I get so deeply involved

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:25.740 align:middle line:84%
in the Marilyn Monroe
story this way,

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and I talked about the
Roswell connection,

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.130 align:middle line:84%
there is another personal
family connection.

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to mention for a moment
my father, Professor Dr. Jules

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Davids, the late Dr. Jules
Davids, Georgetown University

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:45.180 align:middle line:84%
diplomatic historian,
school of foreign service,

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Georgetown, who had Jackie
Kennedy as a student.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And before Kennedy
became president,

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:84%
he was enlisted by
Ted Sorensen to come

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.690 align:middle line:84%
meet with John F.
Kennedy and help him

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.390 align:middle line:84%
with the writing of
"Profiles in Courage."

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's been
speculated forever

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.520 align:middle line:84%
whether that book
was ghostwritten.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I will say that in the
preface to the book,

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.010 align:middle line:84%
my father is mentioned
and is given credit

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.500 align:middle line:84%
for having contributed
materially,

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.520 align:middle line:84%
assisted materially
in the preparation

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.640 align:middle line:90%
of several chapters.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did your father
feel about JFK as a man,

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.700 align:middle line:84%
as a student, as a man,
as a thinker, philosopher?

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: My father,
of course, was always

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.700 align:middle line:90%
a very loyal Democrat.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And he kept his mouth
shut at the time

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:84%
when people tried to prove
that the book was ghostwritten,

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:84%
because then Kennedy shouldn't
have accepted the Pulitzer

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Prize for a ghostwritten book.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not claiming that the
book was actually ghostwritten.

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.250 align:middle line:84%
What I want to say
is that my father

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.410 align:middle line:84%
was enlisted to write first
drafts of five of the nine

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.582 align:middle line:90%
chapters.

00:42:53.582 --> 00:42:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the movie
business, it would

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.165 align:middle line:84%
be like writing a treatment,
and then somebody else

00:42:57.165 --> 00:42:58.650 align:middle line:90%
writes the screenplay.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:01.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't get screenplay
credit for writing a treatment.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't get credit
for being the author

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:07.290 align:middle line:84%
of the book for writing the
material that is the foundation

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:84%
information that
someone else has to put

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:90%
into a true literary form.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But he was involved
with the Kennedys,

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and we had a lot of
letters back and forth.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was involved with
the Roswell incident.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's how it falls into
my lap, this Marilyn Monroe

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.810 align:middle line:84%
story with a document
that connects Roswell,

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.290 align:middle line:90%
connects the Kennedys.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And through the research
and reading so many books

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.090 align:middle line:84%
by many, many terrific
authors who have investigated,

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I have this feeling so strong
that somehow in this universe,

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn is very disquieted
and she is not happy.

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to have the official
verdict be that you are

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:53.170 align:middle line:84%
a probable suicide when you
were eliminate through this kind

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:58.985 align:middle line:84%
of-- it shouldn't be allowed
to sit that way forever,

00:43:58.985 --> 00:44:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and "Marilyn Monroe
Declassified"

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.300 align:middle line:84%
now has that purpose of saying,
let's set the record straight,

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.270 align:middle line:84%
not just for history, but for
the sake of this wonderful

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:09.320 align:middle line:90%
actress--

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Someone
doesn't want it to--

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.915 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: --a
beautiful woman who

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:14.955 align:middle line:84%
entertained us, who was
such a wonderful soul.

00:44:14.955 --> 00:44:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
in fact, you have

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:20.320 align:middle line:84%
John Gilmore, a long, long,
lifetime friend of hers,

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.250 align:middle line:84%
who speaks about her
character, and he said,

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.690 align:middle line:84%
she was just one of the
most beautiful, wonderful

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.604 align:middle line:90%
human beings he had ever known.

00:44:27.604 --> 00:44:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: He said
she was perfect.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was a
perfect human being.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: There was
nothing you could say

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.470 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't perfect about her.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.860 align:middle line:84%
John Gilmore, by the way, I
appreciate his contribution

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to the movie, as I
appreciate so many others.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.170 align:middle line:84%
He wrote books like
"The Black Dahlia."

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's a great
Hollywood noir writer.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he really
has a special spot for her.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.104 align:middle line:90%
Now, again--

00:44:46.104 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: I want to mention
he wrote a book about Marilyn,

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and also "Laid Bare" is
one of his great books.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Doc Erickson, C. O. Erikson,
he was a production manager

00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:02.790 align:middle line:84%
for her wonderful film that
was written by Arthur Miller,

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:03.670 align:middle line:90%
"The Misfits."

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:05.795 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you about that next.

00:45:05.795 --> 00:45:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: John
Huston directed it.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And so he contributed
to the film,

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.972 align:middle line:90%
giving us inside information.

00:45:11.972 --> 00:45:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I think--

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Mora-- Phillippe Mora.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, Phillippe Mora.

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: The
terrific director--

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:18.370 align:middle line:84%
he directed
"Communion," speaking

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.420 align:middle line:84%
of UFO stories, the
Whitley Strieber story.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.080 align:middle line:84%
He found in an FBI
document that was

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:29.600 align:middle line:84%
declassified that implicated
Robert Kennedy in all

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.030 align:middle line:90%
of these events.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think the implication
was, as Giancanas have said,

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:43.010 align:middle line:84%
is that they intended to time
it to frame Robert Kennedy.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:44.800 align:middle line:90%
He would have been a victim.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It might have brought
the administration down.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.410 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that Bobby
Kennedy, in my opinion--

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Knocked her off.

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: No, I don't think so.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:54.454 align:middle line:84%
And I think all of these things
on the internet about that are,

00:45:54.454 --> 00:45:57.190 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion, ugly and wrong.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think Robert Kennedy
was an exceptional man.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.510 align:middle line:84%
He might have been
a great leader.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that it
was an act of wisdom

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.870 align:middle line:84%
for him to go after
the Mob the way

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:08.570 align:middle line:90%
he did in those Senate hearing.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he paid
for it in the end anyway.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think what I was
alluding to with her is,

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:18.060 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of very vulnerable,
sensitive human beings,

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.020 align:middle line:84%
it didn't mean that
she was necessarily

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.520 align:middle line:84%
stable emotionally right
up through the latter part

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.320 align:middle line:90%
of her life.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.790 align:middle line:90%
She was not stable.

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And to have the
knowledge she had

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and be the keeper of those
secrets of the Kennedys,

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.950 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't wise of Kennedy.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:39.080 align:middle line:84%
She should not have been
made aware of these things,

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.980 align:middle line:90%
as unstable as she was.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: He compromised
himself, and he--

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
compromised her.

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:46.068 align:middle line:84%
He compromised both of their
lives, and neither one of them

00:46:46.068 --> 00:46:47.630 align:middle line:90%
lived too long past that date.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:49.150 align:middle line:90%
And RFK certainly didn't.

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: He died--
he was assassinated

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.650 align:middle line:90%
a year after she died.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.670 align:middle line:90%
She died in August.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So we're not talking
that November,

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.700 align:middle line:84%
but the next November of
'63, he's assassinated.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Then a few years after
that, Bobby Kennedy

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:07.540 align:middle line:84%
is assassinated the very day
he wins the California primary.

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of
affairs and all that,

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I've always had a soft spot for
all three of those characters

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, saw
Bobby Kennedy the night

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.600 align:middle line:90%
before he died up close.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I was at one of the
rallies in Sacramento

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.280 align:middle line:90%
before he flew to LA.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of the
lack of nuanced thinking

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that the internet
thrives on, which

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:33.090 align:middle line:84%
is you can have incredible human
beings with their own frailties

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:37.080 align:middle line:84%
that result in these kinds of
devastating situations, which

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.740 align:middle line:84%
really this was, a sad
and devastating affair.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.820 align:middle line:90%
He was being watched.

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:45.020 align:middle line:84%
He was being gone
after, his brother was--

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.830 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence agencies
were after his brother.

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:49.557 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was after Marilyn.

00:47:49.557 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:84%
That something horrible
didn't happen to the three

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.210 align:middle line:84%
of them would have been
surprising, honestly.

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Philippe Mora,
who found that FBI document,

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.410 align:middle line:84%
had a very good point of
view about all of this.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.990 align:middle line:90%
I like the way he described it.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:07.170 align:middle line:84%
We had a very turbulent 1960s,
the Vietnam War and a lot

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:09.090 align:middle line:90%
of violence in America.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And he says that the
death of Marilyn Monroe

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.750 align:middle line:84%
marks the beginning of
the '60s as we know it,

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:18.040 align:middle line:90%
though it was August 1962.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:84%
From there, she was like--
she was the first one.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:24.720 align:middle line:90%
She was the first one down.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.690 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By the
intelligence-- I

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.340 align:middle line:84%
mean, again, at the hand
of intelligence agencies.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.631 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And they've all
paid for it with their lives.

00:48:30.631 --> 00:48:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Look, not just John F.
Kennedy and Bob Kennedy.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Sam Giancana ends
up with, what is

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.070 align:middle line:90%
it, nine bullets in the brain?

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:38.430 align:middle line:90%
He's assassinated.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And then Johnny Roselli, the
Mobster that he worked with--

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say that one
of those writers out there

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.810 align:middle line:84%
speculated that Johnny
Roselli was in the hit team,

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.277 align:middle line:84%
and that by him showing up at
the door, and she knew him--

00:48:52.277 --> 00:48:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: --as a friend.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would
have been an entree.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: She would have
opened the door for him.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And-- [SNAPS]-- they'd have
just taken care of business like

00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.230 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:00.020 align:middle line:90%
They're professionals.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It's the Mob.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're professionals.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.440 align:middle line:90%
They hit people.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about-- OK, the case was--

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Oh, Johnny
Roselli, I just have to say,

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Sam Giancana dies
from assassination.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Johnny Roselli ends
up in an oil drum, OK?

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Jimmy Hoffa killed and
disappears, never found again.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:21.660 align:middle line:84%
You see, violence
descended on all of them.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.366 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some
other misfortune

00:49:23.366 --> 00:49:24.990 align:middle line:84%
beyond that-- let's
go to "The Misfits"

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:26.660 align:middle line:90%
and what happened then.

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Well, "The Misfits"--

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Famous film, famous,
famous film and the end

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:33.260 align:middle line:90%
is a lot of lives.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Sad, tragic film.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to mention that I
knew John Huston personally.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I worked for his
agent, Paul Kohner.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I had the great
opportunity to visit him

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:47.270 align:middle line:84%
in Puerto Vallarta on several
occasions and stay with him--

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:49.990 align:middle line:84%
fabulous, wonderful
director and actor,

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:51.420 align:middle line:90%
a great treasure for America.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.690 align:middle line:84%
He's got a postage
stamp after him.

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:55.850 align:middle line:90%
He directed "The Misfits."

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:59.374 align:middle line:84%
And Marilyn's behavior at
that time was a huge problem.

00:49:59.374 --> 00:50:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Totally
unstable by this time.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.225 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: She was
unstable, drugs.

00:50:02.225 --> 00:50:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, alcohol.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: They shut down
the production for a week

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.690 align:middle line:90%
to let her clean out.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:11.144 align:middle line:84%
He refused, of course, to fire
her and cast somebody else.

00:50:11.144 --> 00:50:12.560 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't have
finished the film

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.450 align:middle line:90%
if that was what he had to do.

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But many of the people
involved with "The Misfits"

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:19.774 align:middle line:90%
died soon after the film was--

00:50:19.774 --> 00:50:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Clark Gable.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:22.481 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Clark Gable
drops dead of a heart

00:50:22.481 --> 00:50:26.965 align:middle line:84%
attack like two weeks-- two
weeks after the film is done.

00:50:26.965 --> 00:50:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Montgomery Clift.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:29.214 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Montgomery Clift.

00:50:29.214 --> 00:50:31.532 align:middle line:90%


00:50:31.532 --> 00:50:32.490 align:middle line:90%
There was another, too.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:32.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to forget.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
there is another.

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:35.050 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember, either.

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:35.980 align:middle line:90%
I did write it down.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: But they
say that it was

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.410 align:middle line:84%
like a cursed film, One of
her dramatic roles, a very

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:45.830 align:middle line:84%
serious role, is contrasted
with her great comedies.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was her
last finished film.

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:51.160 align:middle line:84%
She was cast in one more
film called "Something's Got

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.720 align:middle line:84%
To Give," a comedy
at 20th Century Fox.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.670 align:middle line:90%
And it was never finished.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It was at about the time when
she sang "Happy Birthday, Mr.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.640 align:middle line:90%
President."

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.873 align:middle line:90%
She took time off for that.

00:51:02.873 --> 00:51:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:07.680 align:middle line:84%
They had problems
completing the movie.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.596 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't showing up
on the set all the time.

00:51:09.596 --> 00:51:10.750 align:middle line:90%
It was never finished.

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:13.070 align:middle line:90%
And they fired her.

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.110 align:middle line:90%
They fired Marilyn Monroe.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:21.710 align:middle line:84%
But just shortly
before she died,

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:26.620 align:middle line:84%
her attorneys got her rehired
with a better contract,

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.790 align:middle line:84%
with guarantees of
future pictures,

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:34.880 align:middle line:84%
with her salary multiplied
many times over.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
would depress a woman

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:38.410 align:middle line:90%
to the state of suicide?

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it wasn't
as though the split-up

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:44.347 align:middle line:90%
was fresh on her doorstep.

00:51:44.347 --> 00:51:46.930 align:middle line:84%
That had happened-- really, it
had been happening over months.

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.527 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't new
information to her.

00:51:48.527 --> 00:51:50.360 align:middle line:84%
She had other things
going on in their life,

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.510 align:middle line:84%
like you said, things to
be very encouraged about.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:54.301 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, and
she was also encouraged

00:51:54.301 --> 00:51:59.304 align:middle line:84%
that there was a rapprochement
with Joe DiMaggio.

00:51:59.304 --> 00:52:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was
speculation they

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.300 align:middle line:90%
were considering remarrying.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's testimony from
Marilyn's housekeeper, Eunice

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Murray, that, what, an
hour or so before Marilyn

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.450 align:middle line:84%
shows up dead that she had a
phone call from Joe DiMaggio's

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.670 align:middle line:84%
son that encouraged
Marilyn so much

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and made her bubbly and
happy and she's enthusiastic

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.890 align:middle line:90%
and that's her state of mind.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:29.102 align:middle line:84%
And then within a
couple of hours--

00:52:29.102 --> 00:52:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was dead.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:30.935 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: She's gone.

00:52:30.935 --> 00:52:31.970 align:middle line:90%
She's gone.

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:32.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't add up.

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't add up.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It never added up.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we only
have a few minutes left,

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.694 align:middle line:84%
and I want to
bring up something.

00:52:36.694 --> 00:52:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So in 1993, the
case was reopened.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.440 align:middle line:84%
The foreman in charge was
to announce the inquiry.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.280 align:middle line:90%
He was fired from his spot.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.720 align:middle line:90%
And then it was shut down again.

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.710 align:middle line:84%
No one wants this information
surrounding her death

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and the Kennedys to
surface formally-- period.

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:52.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, they did
shut down that grand jury.

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:57.170 align:middle line:90%
They fired the foreman.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to announce
that they were going to--

00:52:58.980 --> 00:52:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going
to let it happen.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: It's highly
politically charged.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:09.650 align:middle line:84%
The Kennedys are involved and
implicated, but not the cause.

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right I understand
what you're saying.

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: But the government
did a similar thing

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.180 align:middle line:84%
with Jean Seberg,
another famous actress.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.100 align:middle line:84%
They didn't like her support
of the Black Panthers.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.090 align:middle line:90%
They tapped her phone.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:21.890 align:middle line:90%
They followed her.

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:22.790 align:middle line:90%
They tormented her.

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:28.010 align:middle line:84%
They released false stories
about her to the tabloids.

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And it was malicious.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.670 align:middle line:84%
They did drive her to
suicide in that case.

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But there is this history
in that dark period

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.030 align:middle line:84%
of American history,
in that time,

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.247 align:middle line:84%
of the government
agencies functioning

00:53:44.247 --> 00:53:46.830 align:middle line:84%
in that way against individuals
that they considered a threat.

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and all
three of them were a threat.

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:54.120 align:middle line:84%
The Kennedys and Marilyn were
a threat to them at that time.

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And so just to wrap
this up, I'd like

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:58.900 align:middle line:90%
to play one more film clip.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've forgotten
who was stating it.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.380 align:middle line:84%
It's at the very end, talking
about how disgraceful-- set it

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.180 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Who's saying this?

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:10.320 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVIDS: At the conclusion of
our film, author Don Burleson,

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.980 align:middle line:10%
who worked with
that CIA document,

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.900 align:middle line:10%
he expressed his
heartfelt feelings,

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.470 align:middle line:10%
his respect for Marilyn
and his sense of sorrow

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.130 align:middle line:10%
over all of this.

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go to
that film clip now.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Marilyn was an
extraordinary person.

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:32.070 align:middle line:10%
She was so different from
the Hollywood construct

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:33.820 align:middle line:10%
that it's almost
not recognizable.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.410 align:middle line:90%
She was intelligent.

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:37.870 align:middle line:90%
She was well read.

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:40.370 align:middle line:84%
She loved the music
of Bela Bartok.

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:42.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she read Thomas Hardy.

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:44.140 align:middle line:90%
She read James Joyce.

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.470 align:middle line:90%
She read Shakespeare.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.510 align:middle line:84%
We can't bring her
back, but we can

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.710 align:middle line:84%
remedy some of what's
been done to her memory.

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:53.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a national disgrace
what was done to her.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, thank you
so much for taking the time

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.610 align:middle line:84%
to do such a fabulous
job on this documentary.

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:01.775 align:middle line:84%
It was very enlightening and
about people that, you know,

00:55:01.775 --> 00:55:04.500 align:middle line:84%
it's still our Camelot in
our own hearts and minds

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.920 align:middle line:84%
about the beauty that each
of these people exemplified,

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:11.370 align:middle line:84%
regardless of the dark side of
human nature at times as well.

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you for
doing that for us and all

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.177 align:middle line:90%
these other films you've done.

00:55:15.177 --> 00:55:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Thank you.

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to talk about another one

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:18.650 align:middle line:90%
yet later.

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: It's always
a pleasure to be

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.950 align:middle line:90%
interviewed by you, Regina.

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.510 align:middle line:84%
This story has been
fascinating on so many levels.

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:28.570 align:middle line:10%
I highly recommend that you
get a copy of the DVD by going
