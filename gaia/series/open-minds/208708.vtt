my mother's hatred

and I'm exactly like him.

knew that the unit existed.

You couldn't pay me a
million dollars to jump out.

lessons he taught--

lose self-importance,
erase personal history,

use death as an advisor,
accept responsibility

for your own acts.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And any time that I felt crappy,
I figured out which one of them

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I was violating
and quit violating.

>> And Myrna.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I had written a bunch
of stuff about Vietnam,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.090 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't sell it anywhere.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But I heard some
wacko in Boulder

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.830 align:middle line:84%
had started a trade journal for
mercenaries, so I called him

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:90%
and he drove 500 miles.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:10%
And then four years
later, I got a card,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:10%
"We have accepted your story."

This is going to be

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.710 align:middle line:90%
an interesting conversation.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be talking with
Jim Morris, author of Dreaming

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:10%
Circus and a man
who has struggled

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:10%
to find a spiritual side in the
place of the world of women.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:10%
It hasn't been easy,
but it was helped

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:10%
when he began developing his
spiritual side with Don Miguel

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:10%
Ruiz and Carlos Castaneda
to understand war and women.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.602 align:middle line:90%
And you've done plenty of both.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JIM MORRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]
Your book came to us

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.005 align:middle line:10%
and, Dreaming Circus,
and of course, no one--

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:49.130 align:middle line:10%
you don't know what it's
about till you get into it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:10%
and start reading it.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:10%
But one thing I
found interesting

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:10%
is you're kind of a--

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.063 align:middle line:10%
though in your
book, like you say,

00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:10%
when you started
this journey, you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:10%
had the spiritual
development of a turnip.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Exactly.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]
And-- but you did go on

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
to do some amazing things and
have some amazing experiences.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: I did.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
developed yourself.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I wanted to
talk to you about all this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.458 align:middle line:10%
is because of this
first part of the story.

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to
that as you tell it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.377 align:middle line:90%
So how about if we dive in?

00:02:16.377 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Without a doubt.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all, your
book is called Dreaming Circus,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and your life reads like
a three-ring circus.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:10%
So why did you title
it Dreaming Circus?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: Well, my
friend, Lee McCormick,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:10%
was writing a book about
his Toltec experiences.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "So what are
you going to call it, Lee?"

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Eagle
and Serpent."

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:90%
But I don't hear very well.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:10%
And I heard The Dreaming Circus.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:10%
And I said, "Did you say
The Dreaming Circus?"

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "No,
Eagle and Serpent."

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "OK.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Eagle and Serpent is yours.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Dreaming Circus is mine."

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, there you go.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:90%
So we have it.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And although you did
have a lucid dream

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.220 align:middle line:84%
in there in the
book, but it's really

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
about something, a much
wider story about the eagle

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:90%
and the serpent, really?

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, Don Miguel
says that our whole lives

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:90%
are a dream.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And you knew Don Miguel Ruiz.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I met him
when I interviewed him

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:90%
for the San Diego Reader.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And I was
on the way there.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I was, OK, is this
guy for realist?

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:90%
You know, the Shaman--

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:90%
what is this about?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And I looked in his
eyes, and I was in.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, wonderful man.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:10%
He played an important role
in my life as well, long ago,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.800 align:middle line:10%
when he first wrote
The Four Agreements.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into
this notion of you.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just talk
about your life story here,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
because there is the
point here, to me,

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.057 align:middle line:84%
is that you were raised in
an age when boys still had

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
to go out and prove
themselves in the world, where

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:90%
you were out of the house.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:10%
And including in
my generation, you

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:10%
had to be out of
the house at 18.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:10%
There was no lollygagging.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.245 align:middle line:84%
You either got a job, got
married, or went to school.

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, I was
out of the house at 12.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Even more so.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And part of your
journey was you were

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.340 align:middle line:90%
one of the first wave of boys.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:90%
You're 83 now, right?

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:90%
You look great.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:10%
You were one of the first wave
of boys that was raised really

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.903 align:middle line:10%
by a solo parent, by a woman.

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: That's true.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which wasn't common.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was raised,
people had two parents.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, I've thought
a lot about that, too.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And the way you describe
it is, you were raised

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.210 align:middle line:90%
as the first metrosexual.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
your experience

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:10%
as a boy being raised
by only a woman, which

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:10%
wasn't natural in the day,
who didn't understand men

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:10%
very well.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, first of
all, it was World War II.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.935 align:middle line:90%
It started when I was four.

00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:84%
One of my earliest experiences
is Roosevelt's Pearl Harbor

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:90%
speech.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And what I remember about
it is it's the only time

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen my mother scared.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And she was a widow
18 months later.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:90%
But we moved around a lot.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:84%
She was a government
secretary in DC.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:84%
When the war started,
she got to open up

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:84%
an office for the
Petroleum administration

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:90%
for War in Tulsa.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So we moved to Tulsa,
lived with other people.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
want us there.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:10%
And that was my first four
or five years of school

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:10%
was living with different
people every year who really

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:10%
didn't much want us there.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.867 align:middle line:10%
And so that was not great.

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, right.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, and you said your
mom was terrifying to you.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:10%
You were afraid of your mother.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I was-- well, not
intermittently.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:90%
But she just wanted me to be--

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
she did not want me
to be like my dad.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that the most
intense emotion I've ever felt

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
was my mother's
hatred for my father,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:90%
and I'm exactly like him.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: But she was
oblivious to that.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.705 align:middle line:84%
She made me into somebody
else in her mind.

00:06:04.705 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that interesting?

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So she was trying
to raise you to be

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:90%
the perfect little gentleman.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:84%
You talk about this in
terms of the film characters

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.780 align:middle line:84%
you were interested
in, the actors.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:10%
Your mom had a lifelong
thing for Van Johnson,

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:10%
the golden-haired gentleman
that appeared in many,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:10%
many films of her day where--

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:10%
You liked David Niven, who was
a gentleman and an officer.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.745 align:middle line:90%
You liked that whole story.

00:06:26.745 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well, he went to--

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:90%
he was a Sandhurst grad.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: He was a major in
the commandos in World War II.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: His batman
was Peter Ustinov.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't know that.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.715 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:37.515 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:37.515 --> 00:06:38.315 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So you had an
intrigue with this.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:10%
So there was something in
you that was, as a young man,

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:10%
really trying to find your edge.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:10%
And so this is the part
that's interesting to me

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:10%
in contemporary time.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:10%
Well, now.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:10%
And that is you have, now,
one or two generations of boys

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:10%
who've been raised by women.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a common phenomena.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So here, you have
boys that still

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
have the same levels
of testosterone

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
in their bodies going
through puberty.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:10%
They still have this need
to press against something

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:10%
and rebel and sharpen
edges, but there's nothing

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:10%
to sharpen them against now.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, it
depends on the mom.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.362 align:middle line:90%
OK, interesting.

00:07:22.362 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead with that one.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well, my mother was--

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:84%
she was quite beautiful,
and she was a lady.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
But I have a friend, in
fact, a friend who lives here

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.432 align:middle line:84%
in Boulder that I'm probably
going to have dinner

00:07:35.432 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:90%
with tomorrow night.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
I went through OCS,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
he said those TAC officers had
guys with tears running down

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:84%
their cheeks, and
those TAC officers

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
were amateurs
compared to my mother.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So your mother--

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:84%
so you were raised by a
powerful and strong woman.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yes.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so you--

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
but she was raising
you to be something

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.160 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't because you
were, in fact, shaping up

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:84%
to be more like your
dad than anything.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, I
look more like him.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:90%
I act like him.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had his
example to avoid.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not a lot like--

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm like my dad in all
the ways that worked.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:90%
He was my first mystic.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.527 align:middle line:84%
He's practiced yoga from
the age of about 10 on.

00:08:28.527 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: He sent $0.15 to
a magazine and got a manual

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and started following
that manual.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And doing-- and so he had a
lifelong practice of yoga?

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.972 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What was it your
mom hated so much about him?

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: He sued her
for divorce the same week

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:45.992 align:middle line:90%
her mother died.

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that
was insensitive.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, he didn't know.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.905 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: But I don't think
she took that into account.

00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And I've never been
able to get clear on this.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I know she lost a girl after me,
and I think they had a fight.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And well, as I said
in the book, they

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:84%
both had the reckless
courage of kamikazes.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm glad I wasn't
there for that fight.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:10%
So you got out young.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:10%
And then you decided to-- you
went to military school, right?

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
that a little bit.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Did you get to start
feeling your masculinity

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:84%
when you went to military school
or was that stomped out of you?

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: OK.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd been a loner, and I was
still pretty much a loner.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
But by the end of the first
day in military school,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I had three more
friends than I'd ever

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:84%
had before, which was three,
which was my roommates.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that happened
is that kid in the eighth grade

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:90%
decided he was going to haze me.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And entirely more by
accident than design,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I did the perfect aikido move
and sent him to the hospital.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So nobody messed with me for the
two years I was in that school.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
went on like that.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So by the time you end up
going into the military,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.175 align:middle line:90%
you wanted to see some action.

00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:84%
You didn't want
to go to Germany.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.890 align:middle line:10%
In the day, you could
get sent over to Germany

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:10%
on a base or a desk job that
was pretty common in the time.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.988 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to see some
action and we had the--

00:10:25.988 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, I wanted
to be in special forces.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be in special
forces from the first time

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.605 align:middle line:90%
I knew that the unit existed.

00:10:32.605 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that happened?

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:84%
You did, and you
ended up being chosen,

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and you ended up going
to parachuting school?

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a minute

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.770 align:middle line:84%
because you said
graduation from that,

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.480 align:middle line:84%
doing that was the most
proud moment of your life up

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:90%
to that point.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, before that,
I was a loner and nerd.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Mama's boy.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And once I had those wings, I
was just a whole new category

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.650 align:middle line:90%
of personnel.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.135 align:middle line:84%
And besides, I loved jumping
out of the airplanes.

00:11:02.135 --> 00:11:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:10%
I can't even-- you can't pay me
a million dollars to jump out.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:10%
And it's just the thrill,
the exhilaration of it?

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I just
never understood

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
why people actually trusted
those chutes would open.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, I
knew the riggers.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:90%
And oh, God.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't have time for me
to go off into stories,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.615 align:middle line:84%
but they keep
popping into my head.

00:11:26.615 --> 00:11:27.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:27.415 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:90%
So you did it.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:90%
You lived through it.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So then you end up
going to Vietnam.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting because
you stated that those first six

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:10%
months in Vietnam were the
happiest years of your life

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:10%
and months of your life.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people
that went to Vietnam

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
say those were the worst
years of their life.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I've heard
people say that.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So what is it about
going into this weird war

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.560 align:middle line:10%
of guerrilla warfare?

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: OK.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:10%
It took me a long
time to figure it out.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But let's jump
back to Castaneda.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: The first four lessons
he taught, at least to me,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
were lose self-importance,
erase personal history,

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
use death as an advisor,
accept responsibility

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:90%
for your own acts.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
a personal history.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.695 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
self-importance.

00:12:14.695 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
were in a foreign land,

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:90%
and you weren't important there.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And I used death
as an advisor because, hey.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had to accept
responsibility for my own acts

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:90%
because I was usually in charge.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:90%
So and he's right.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the formula
for happiness.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.162 align:middle line:84%
You follow those rules,
those four rules.

00:12:35.162 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Say them again
for anybody listening.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Lose self-importance,
erase personal history,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:84%
use death as an advisor,
accept responsibility

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:90%
for your own acts.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:84%
When I learned them, I made
an acronym out of them--

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:90%
LEDA.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And any time that I felt
crappy, I ran through that list

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and figured out
which one of them

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I was violating and
quit violating it.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, now, we're
talking off camera

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:10%
and I was telling you, because
I used to be on those flights

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:10%
with the soldiers going
over and coming back.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:10%
And the soldiers
coming back, I didn't

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:10%
understand it, the psychology.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Going over, there was this
jubilation and jockeying around

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and jokey.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Adrenaline was up.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
adrenaline was up.

00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Yay, we're going to go
to war and all that.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:10%
Coming home, it was
like being in a hearse.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There was no energy.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:90%
These were flat-faced people.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:10%
I would see young girls, Thai
girls or Vietnamese girls,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:10%
with their babies from the
man, the American soldiers,

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:10%
who were going to
go on to become

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:10%
rejects of their own
family and society.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a whole
different spectrum.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:90%
It looked horrible, honestly.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But you weren't even part
of the regular infantry.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: No.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: We used to
call them The Americans.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.272 align:middle line:10%
So why was your experience
so different over there?

00:13:54.272 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:10%
Because you have some
unique experience--

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: Because my
troops were all natives

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:10%
of one sort or another.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were 12
Americans there in a team.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we went out on
patrol, they were usually

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:90%
five Americans with 100 guys.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.970 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these were the
locals, yeah, fighting on,

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:84%
quote, "you're fighting
on their side."

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Right.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And I knew that I was
making a positive contribution

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:90%
to those people's lives.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
didn't it turn out--

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm going to bring
a couple-- one of these--

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:90%
It turned out really bad.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:90%
It turned out bad.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't exactly
what you thought.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:90%
And you started realizing--

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:84%
the Russians came
in on one side.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Soviets
came in on one side,

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:90%
we came in on the other side.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And the fact was some
of these were thousands

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
of year-old tribal wars
that were actually going on

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:90%
of which you guys had no idea.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: The tribe I
worked with, the Jarai,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:84%
had been fighting the tribe
that the VC controlled

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:90%
for about 900 years.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
guys hadn't a clue?

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.895 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah, we--

00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:58.213 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:14:58.213 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Soviets and
Americans, really?

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, we
picked it up fast.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:90%
We had to.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And so here you
are in a situation.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:10%
You're trying to live by
Castaneda's, you know.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: Well, not then.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You weren't there yet.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:10%
You were--

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: No, that was later.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that was later.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.127 align:middle line:84%
So you're just jacked up,
and you're in special forces

00:15:18.127 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and you love what you're
doing and so forth.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:10%
But the fact was there
were incredible atrocities

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:10%
and decisions that
had to be made.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:10%
You talked about in your
book, one situation,

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:10%
where a four-year-old
has a grenade,

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.203 align:middle line:10%
and you have to
decide what to do.

00:15:31.203 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well, I just met--

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't me.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I met this guy in a bar,
and he looked pretty glum.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "What's with you?"

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "I killed a
four-year-old boy yesterday."

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well,
that's pretty rough."

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Kid
had a grenade."

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And I could relate to that
because we had accidentally

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:84%
killed a teenager, I
guess, he was of the NAR.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember you talking
about that and that affect--

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.582 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I couldn't
get that kid out

00:16:05.582 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:90%
of my dreams for a decade.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because war all seems
so clinical and mechanical,

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:84%
until something
like that happens,

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
when some young person's
life is cut short.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I think it seems
clinical and mechanical

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:90%
from the outside.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
watching it on TV.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:10%
So after that event,
the interesting thing

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:10%
is you have a lot
of living in here.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.747 align:middle line:10%
But you went back
and tried to work

00:16:32.747 --> 00:16:34.830 align:middle line:10%
with the tribe and some
of the people in the tribe

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:35.640 align:middle line:10%
later in life.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well--

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
talk about that a bit?

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: In several ways.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well, OK.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.485 align:middle line:84%
My first interpreter,
Pardo, or Bardo

00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:46.860 align:middle line:84%
is what the
Americans called him.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.367 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he had become a
major in the Cambodian army,

00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and they sent him to
school at Fort Benning.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:90%
So I was out.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I was retired.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But I went to visit him,
and he said, "I tell you,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Morris, after this
war is over, I

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:84%
go back lead my people
against the Vietnamese.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:84%
How do you think
I should do this?"

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:10%
I said, "Well, I'll
do an area study,

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:10%
and I'll tell you what
I think you should do."

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I decided was that he
just didn't have the basics.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have the things
that you need to do that.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And I went to tell him
that, and he said, "Well,

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that's too bad because I'm
going to do it anyway."

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And did you see
the killing fields?

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.977 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: You know the thing
when the French embassy threw

00:17:28.977 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:90%
the Cambodians out?

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Because he and his family
were among those people.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.115 align:middle line:84%
So continue on how you
went back and interfaced

00:17:38.115 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:90%
with these people later on.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, I
went back and I had

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:90%
a Lord Jim fantasy go in there.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was just garbage
because those guys knew more

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.260 align:middle line:84%
about running raids and ambushes
than I did at that point.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
What they needed was
international backing.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So I came home, and the
idea was to round up--

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:84%
they said-- they were
fans of Teddy Kennedy.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:84%
He had made a speech to
the UN that impressed them.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote him, and
they just blew me off.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And I got stoned
and stayed stoned

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:90%
for about the next decade.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And then-- but all that
stuff that I picked up there,

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
I was able to use in a refugee
project several years later.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.920 align:middle line:10%
And we got 200 people.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.980 align:middle line:84%
The first 200 Montagnards,
well, actually, there

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:90%
may be a dozen here before that.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:84%
But we got the first
200 Montagnards

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
out of a refugee
camp in Thailand

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and into the United States.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And then this wild and
crazy correspondent

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.580 align:middle line:84%
named Nate Thayer
found another 800

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:84%
that were in the
woods in Cambodia.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And we had run the State
Department through.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So many changes getting
this first 200 over

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that they just, yeah,
bring them home.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.030 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
fight that one, huh.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.767 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of them
immigrated to California.

00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: Oh, that's true.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot of people.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.637 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: That's true.

00:19:14.637 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
But most of them went to--

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
well, I was
instrumental in getting

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.773 align:middle line:90%
resettled in North Carolina.

00:19:22.773 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: Well, I wanted--
they'd work for special forces.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Some of the guys had,
most of the guys had.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's where SF is located.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.160 align:middle line:90%
So I knew they'd have friends.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And my
friend, Don Scott,

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:84%
who was the main guy
in that refugee thing,

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.153 align:middle line:84%
Don wanted to take
them to Massachusetts,

00:19:46.153 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:90%
which was where he was from.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "No.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They'll freeze to death there,
and they won't know anybody."

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So we sent them to Fayetteville,
mostly Fayetteville.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.570 align:middle line:90%
I knew the ones in Greensboro.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still-- one of
the Montagnards married

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.420 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine,
Cindy McCurdy, who's

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:90%
now Cindy [INAUDIBLE NAME].

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Her husband, [INAUDIBLE NAME],,
is a friend of mine.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- he was
the first Montagnard

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I was able to have a real
in-depth conversation

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
with because he'd learned
a lot more English than any

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.670 align:middle line:90%
of the ones I knew there.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.328 align:middle line:10%
So he was telling me
about his experience

00:20:26.328 --> 00:20:27.370 align:middle line:10%
during the Tet Offensive.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it wasn't just
a tour of duty for you.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.030 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just a tour of duty.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Oh, no.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
three tours of duty.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: It was a life.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a life, and you
were integrated into that life.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And you cared about what
happened to the people

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:90%
after that life.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, we
lived in a rattan shack,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and I would wake
up in the morning

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and there'd be a lady in
the long house next door,

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:84%
husking rice with a thing
that looked like a Louisville

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Slugger.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a mortar and pestle.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And I would wake up to that--
kathunk, kathunk, kathunk,

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.432 align:middle line:90%
this lady husking the rice.

00:21:02.432 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:10%
And that's interesting
because it did teach you

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:10%
about what a lot of people
didn't learn was necessarily

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:10%
about different ways that
people contend with life

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:10%
and how cultures are
structured and how

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:10%
people have different needs.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And you chose to stay.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
You chose to remain involved
with the people that you were,

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:90%
over there--

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.753 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I think
almost all of us have.

00:21:24.753 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In special forces.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because we always
think of you as you

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.672 align:middle line:84%
go and you shoot
them up and go home.

00:21:30.672 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: No.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:90%
There are non--

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:90%
NGOs.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:84%
There are special forces guys
taking care of Montagnards

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:90%
in the states.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.912 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:21:42.912 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:90%
I love that part of it.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, it's
happening again now.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I just made a contribution
to buy a prosthesis

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:90%
for an Afghan interpreter.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And he lost
his leg working for us.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's interesting.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:10%
So special forces
guys stick together,

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:10%
and you have these
experiences with the people,

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:10%
with the local people,
the native people

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.670 align:middle line:10%
of any land you're in.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, my two
best friends in Vietnam

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.740 align:middle line:84%
were my interpreters,
because we could

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:90%
talk more or less in depth.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to
them is not something

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.603 align:middle line:90%
I would wish on anyone.

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:21.103 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe we won't talk
about that right now because I

00:22:21.103 --> 00:22:22.280 align:middle line:90%
don't want to start crying.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Another
topic for another time.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to start crying.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Vietnam time
has passed now.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:10%
And now you've come
back, and now you're

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:10%
in California, right?

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: No, I came
home to Oklahoma.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when did
you go to California?

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.253 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: I went to California--

00:22:39.253 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.400 align:middle line:90%
I went to Cali--

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where are you from
in Oklahoma, by the way?

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well,
mostly Oklahoma City.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oklahoma City, OK.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: But I went
to California in 1990.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:10%
I came there from New York.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:10%
I was an editor in
New York Publishing.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.612 align:middle line:84%
And then before that,
I was a correspondent

00:22:55.612 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:90%
for Soldier of Fortune.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I remember
that part, Soldier of Fortune.

00:22:58.903 --> 00:23:01.418 align:middle line:84%
So you started doing a
lot of drugs is the point.

00:23:01.418 --> 00:23:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: When I
first got out, yeah.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you first got
out and that was pretty common.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the
Haight-Ashbury thing,

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:84%
because I was very young, and
I watched soldiers coming home.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And I watched the streets
filling with homeless people

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.127 align:middle line:90%
including a lot of vets.

00:23:14.127 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I do have
to tell one story.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, tell us.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: When I was on my way
back to Vietnam the last time,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I had a three-day layover
at Travis Air Force Base.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And I'd been--
the hippie thing was--

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Going?

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: You're right.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, this
is pretty interesting.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.387 align:middle line:90%
So I'll take a look at that.

00:23:30.387 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.677 align:middle line:84%
If I go down there in
civvies with this haircut,

00:23:35.677 --> 00:23:37.010 align:middle line:90%
they'll just think I'm an idiot.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:90%
So I went-- I put on the suit--

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
jump boots, green beret,
wings, combat infantry,

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:90%
all that stuff.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:90%
And I went down there.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wait, to where?

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:10%
To Haight-Ashbury?

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.697 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Haight-Ashbury.

00:23:50.697 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dressed as, oh.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Dressed like that.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A green beret.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And it was
like I was just--

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.370 align:middle line:90%
they gave me a wide berth.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And I checked into
a silversmith shop,

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and a kid came in there in a
wheelchair looking for work.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Are you
what you look like?"

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.825 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Yeah."

00:24:07.825 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "What
are you doing here?"

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
you doing here?

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.113 align:middle line:84%
And so then he said, "Well,
I'll show you around."

00:24:13.113 --> 00:24:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I was with him in a
wheelchair, all of that menace

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.750 align:middle line:90%
was gone.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And we wound
up making friends

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:84%
with a guy who
owned a head shop.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:84%
We went up to his
apartment that afternoon.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:84%
He turned me on to weed
for the first time.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:10%
He said, "I'm going
to do some acid.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you mind?"

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:90%
I said, "No.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:90%
It's your apartment."

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So he-- it was the
Summer of Love, 1967.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.570 align:middle line:90%
He did some sugar cube acid.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And we were listening-- it's
the first time he'd ever

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:90%
heard The Doors.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.300 align:middle line:84%
We were playing The
Doors' first album.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Listen to that."

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:90%
He was pretty high by this time.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Listen, that's the
greatest Afro-Cuban rhythm."

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "It's not
an Afro-Cuban rhythm.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.970 align:middle line:90%
It's some band called The Doors.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.890 align:middle line:84%
They're doing a song
called The End."

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Not
the record, man.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:90%
The refrigerator motor.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Listen to it."

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] All right.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.690 align:middle line:90%
So welcome to Haight-Ashbury.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep, yep.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that story.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that once
you connected with that world,

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:90%
you were--

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:90%
you were kind of--

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: I was in.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.213 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were all in.

00:25:19.213 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Anything you did,
you were all in.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.295 align:middle line:84%
So now, you went from
this lifestyle, discipline

00:25:23.295 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot as a
Green Beret, to drugs.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, let's give
Ken Kesey credit for that.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Ken Kesey, absolutely.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And I read The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And I actually knew
the Whole Earth Catalog

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:90%
guy, Stewart Brand.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
He and I have been lieutenants
together at Fort Dix.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:10%
So what was--

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you would,
in a cliche sense,

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.010 align:middle line:10%
I would say, well, after
the atrocities of war

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:10%
and all, you might want to
turn to acid and other drugs

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.832 align:middle line:10%
to maybe forget about
it or drown yourself.

00:25:56.832 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's not necessarily
what you were doing.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, I was
just looking for something

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:90%
to belong to.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And with all that moving
around as a child,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:84%
the military was
something to belong to.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I did not want to belong
to corporate America,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:18.220 align:middle line:84%
but I was really interested
in the music, for one thing.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:24.712 align:middle line:90%
And it felt like home.

00:26:24.712 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And where
was that again?

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: In Norman, Oklahoma.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Norman, Oklahoma.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Which is a university town.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Not at all like the
rest of the state.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And so then you have
your wives started

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.870 align:middle line:90%
entering into the story, right?

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.130 align:middle line:90%
So this was something.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going back to
stuff with mom and everything,

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're drawing these
women into your life.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't written
down, but you'll need to--

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:84%
before we get to the Don
Miguel Ruiz part, let's see.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:90%
One of them was named--

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.500 align:middle line:84%
there was Sidney, and there
was Vadna, and there was--

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Juanita, Cindy--

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:04.255 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Juanita.

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:05.055 align:middle line:90%
I missed her.

00:27:05.055 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Vadna, Cat--

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Myrna.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: And Myrna.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:90%
So what was this journey?

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:90%
So you were on all these drugs.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.965 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you were talking
about your wedding.

00:27:14.965 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:90%
I have written down here.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Strawberry acid was served
at your wedding with Cindy.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.507 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you were all in.

00:27:20.507 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: OK I was still--

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.798 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Married by a witch.

00:27:22.798 --> 00:27:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I was still living
at home with my first wife.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:29.290 align:middle line:90%
The first time I ever tripped.

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, she didn't-- she was
not delighted by this turn

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:40.300 align:middle line:10%
of events, and other things
just dissolved the marriage.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I met Cindy,
and we went to--

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, we were both fifth
wheels going to a concert.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:90%
So we were thrown together.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the concert,
she went to sleep

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:90%
with her head on my shoulder.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And then when I took her home,
I kissed her and that was it.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:90%
I was a goner.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I remember you telling
me she was a pretty one.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:90%
But you said that Cindy--

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:84%
so you got married by a witch,
and they served strawberry acid

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But you said something about
Cindy that was interesting.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.070 align:middle line:84%
You said in your
relationship with her,

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:84%
you were able to see
life differently.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:90%
You were able to see--

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well, she's an artist.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:90%
She taught me to see textures.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.240 align:middle line:90%
She taught me to--

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had lived
in a geometric--

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: World of rock.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:38.325 align:middle line:84%
And she was fascinated
with moss and bark and all

00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
of those kinds of
things, and she

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.770 align:middle line:84%
taught me to just see the
world in a whole new way.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:90%
And well, she's still doing it.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We're still friends,
close friends.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So with her,
she opened you up,

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:10%
like you said, from
this stone-solid world

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:10%
into the more subtle and
colorful aspect of life.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:90%
So you were young.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.150 align:middle line:90%
That dissolved, right?

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yes.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us what happens from
there and then where the Don

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Miguel Ruíz part
starts coming in.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:11.837 align:middle line:90%
And Myrna was a big part.

00:29:11.837 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about her, too.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: Well, I had to--

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:10%
yeah, Myrna's-- well worth
[LAUGHS] the conversation.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But well, what happened
after that was, first of all,

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I got a job doing a tech
writing job for the Post Office

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Department.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So I had six months to
convert one of their manuals

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.120 align:middle line:84%
into programmed instruction,
and I finished one third of it

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:90%
by noon the first day.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, [SIGHS]
I've got to slow down.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to look
like I'm working.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, anybody reading
a hardback book

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
with the dust jacket laid aside
looks like they're working.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And I saw A Separate Reality
in a bookstore window.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:90%
So I got that, and I read it.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
this is a whole new way

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:58.470 align:middle line:90%
of looking at the world.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:59.700 align:middle line:90%
This is really interesting.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So then I got Journey to Ixtlan,
and then I got Tales of Power.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And then while I was supposed
to be there working on the--

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Manual.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: --on the manual,
I edited all the teaching

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
parts of the first
four Castaneda books

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.520 align:middle line:90%
into a sorcerer's manual.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: And so I
really learned that stuff

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:10%
when I was doing that.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to practice it.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:24.830 align:middle line:90%
But I still didn't--

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was like--

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:84%
20 years before, I never
met anybody else that

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.460 align:middle line:90%
had the slightest interest.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say you
were way ahead of your time

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.663 align:middle line:90%
in doing this.

00:30:34.663 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, the stuff
was hot immediately.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Castaneda's
work were best sellers,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:90%
instant bestsellers.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So there were all
kinds of people

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.200 align:middle line:84%
who were interested in it,
but I didn't know any of them.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Norman, Oklahoma.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: In, well, in--

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.522 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:30:49.522 --> 00:30:50.980 align:middle line:84%
There may have been
some in Norman,

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:84%
but I just didn't
bump into them.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:84%
What my friends
were into as well,

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
my best friend at that time,
was the lead guitar player

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:84%
in a mediocre rock
and roll band.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what--
we were into the music,

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:90%
we were into that life.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.420 align:middle line:10%
But then they all graduated.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I was in grad school, but they
all graduated and went away.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was, well, I
got married again.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.663 align:middle line:84%
But I'd rather not even
talk about that one.

00:31:20.663 --> 00:31:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we
passed over that one.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: But then I
got the tech writing job

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and started learning
the Castaneda stuff.

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And I started trying
to lucid dream,

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and I started going on vision
quests and stuff like that.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.375 align:middle line:90%
And it worked to a large degree.

00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When
you say it worked,

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.875 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean it worked?

00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well,
when I started all

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that, I was a writer who hadn't
sold anything for six years.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't get arrested,
and I was depressed.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.190 align:middle line:90%
And I was--

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:54.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I couldn't get
arrested by a publisher.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:32:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And not too long after
that, I sold another book

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.030 align:middle line:90%
and got a better job.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a better job, and
I had written a bunch of stuff

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:10.560 align:middle line:90%
about Vietnam.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't sell it anywhere.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But I heard some
wacko in Boulder

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:middle line:84%
had started a trade
journal for mercenaries.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So I called him, and
he drove 500 miles

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:84%
out of his way to pick up
my box of stuff from which I

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.560 align:middle line:90%
had no copies.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.380 align:middle line:10%
Took it back to
Boulder, lost it.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And then four years
later, I got a card,

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:90%
"We have accepted your story."

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.533 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, which story?

00:32:35.533 --> 00:32:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which story?

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.695 align:middle line:84%
Well, their new editor
had found my box,

00:32:39.695 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and they bought all of it
before they were through.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.307 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're a
very engaging writer.

00:32:45.307 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Thank you.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just that nothing
was moving, until you started

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.790 align:middle line:90%
doing some of these practices.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: My
viewpoint on the war

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
at that point was highly
unpopular, except with wackos

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:58.210 align:middle line:90%
in Boulder.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us what
your viewpoint had become

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and what you were documenting.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:07.270 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: Well, I just told
war stories, combat tales.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And you couldn't sell a
story unless it was subtitled

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Mea Culpa at that point.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't subtitle
mine Mea Culpa just--

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:21.230 align:middle line:90%
here we were.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:90%
This is what happened.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you started
using some of these principles

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.320 align:middle line:84%
to work with through
rituals and so forth.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And now, were you
still augmenting

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.247 align:middle line:84%
this with hallucinogenics
and so forth at this time?

00:33:35.247 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Say again?

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
augmenting your work

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.150 align:middle line:84%
with hallucinogenics and
drugs still or were you

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.910 align:middle line:90%
beyond that at this time?

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Three years after
I started with psychedelics,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I had an insight.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was that?

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, when I started
doing this, I was too uptight,

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:90%
and I was getting way too loose.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:33:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Unwound.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: So I
just took my stash

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.460 align:middle line:10%
and flushed it down the toilet.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:09.988 align:middle line:84%
And I've had very little contact
with those things since then.

00:34:09.988 --> 00:34:12.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did it serve
to show you at the time?

00:34:12.155 --> 00:34:14.890 align:middle line:90%


00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: OK.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use a phrase from
Castaneda about power plants.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:84%
"They will awaken you from
the torpor of your normal way

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:90%
of thinking."

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.230 align:middle line:90%
They shake you up.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:84%
They let you out of the box
you're in into a bigger room,

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.629 align:middle line:90%
but they won't take you outside.

00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:35.429 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, very well put.

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:37.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.437 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happened there,

00:34:39.437 --> 00:34:42.630 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately, you say--
here, I wrote this down.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You say and I think this was
with Vadna, but I'm not sure.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:47.880 align:middle line:90%
One of them.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.239 align:middle line:84%
You said you were living like
a powerless little husband.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you used to barge around
the house acting like an a-hole

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:84%
just to feel like
you had some power.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.180 align:middle line:90%
And well, I did that.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:90%
I've done that several times.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.902 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: And so eventually--

00:35:07.902 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in fact, you were
feeling powerless as a man.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And why was that?

00:35:12.405 --> 00:35:15.640 align:middle line:84%
You felt totally purposeful
when you were in the war.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I relate it back
to my childhood when--

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.670 align:middle line:84%
that was what my relationship
with my mom was like.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:27.250 align:middle line:84%
We were like-- it was
a male and a female,

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and the female
had all the power.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And what-- the only way
I could assert myself

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:40.670 align:middle line:84%
in that relationship was
by being manipulative.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:90%
And I learned all that.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
interesting because, now,

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.910 align:middle line:84%
again, coming back
to these times,

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:53.065 align:middle line:84%
girls are graduating from
college in greater numbers.

00:35:53.065 --> 00:35:54.440 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
a lot of the jobs

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that more at the head of the
corporations than ever before.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot more men,
white men, in particular,

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.160 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're being
more marginalized.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.090 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I have this fellow
that's a friend of mine.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.730 align:middle line:84%
He was a friend of my
son's for many, many years

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.860 align:middle line:90%
who went into study.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:84%
He went into training to become
a policeman, a cop, right?

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And his trainer told
him right off the bat,

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:84%
"I'm going to tell you
right now, son, you're male

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.840 align:middle line:90%
and you're white.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.990 align:middle line:90%
No one's going to take you."

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And no one took him,
but the other people

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:84%
in his class that were
female, and people

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:35.260 align:middle line:84%
from different ethnic
backgrounds were placed.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:90%
He was not placed.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:40.330 align:middle line:10%
And now, looking
at this whole thing

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.660 align:middle line:10%
of feeling disempowered and
white males, in particular,

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:10%
feeling disempowered
and left behind.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: I read about that.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:51.130 align:middle line:84%
My take on it is if you
need to dominate a woman

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.160 align:middle line:84%
to feel like a man, you don't
understand men or women.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is very true.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.480 align:middle line:90%
That's very true.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So for you,
yourself, how did you

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.030 align:middle line:84%
learn to find your own
power when you yourself felt

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.450 align:middle line:84%
dominated and left
behind in your own life?

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Through 10
years of Toltec training.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this is the key--

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well, OK.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in
this conversation.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.720 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: This is--

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.620 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Don Miguel's method
with his students,

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and this is my
take on his method.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:84%
He might say it's entirely
something different,

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:27.760 align:middle line:84%
but he just peels off the
layers of your discontent

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:84%
until you finally get down
to your authentic self.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And the layers of my
discontent were resentment

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.190 align:middle line:90%
of being a powerless male.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
didn't understand

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.370 align:middle line:90%
any of this at that time.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It was all just me
blundering around.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was through this
training that I got to learn it,

00:37:53.850 --> 00:38:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and that involved six
trips to Teotihaucan

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and going through
that ceremony there,

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:09.020 align:middle line:84%
which, that's what it's designed
to do-- to peel off the layers

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and take you into
who you really are.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So once you got down
to this stripped down powerless

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:19.250 align:middle line:10%
boy, basically, how did
you begin rebuilding?

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:10%
Because there's something-- some
of his practices he works with

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.110 align:middle line:10%
is called--

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.690 align:middle line:10%
I have them written down--
erasing, recapitulation,

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.470 align:middle line:10%
stalking, and shielding.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: OK.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:34.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the great Toltec teachers
is a woman named Gini Gentry.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.470 align:middle line:10%
And Gini was a friend of mine.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.270 align:middle line:90%
I liked her.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:90%
I'd been her student.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.880 align:middle line:90%
I'd been to Peru with her.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd done a bunch
of stuff with her.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:46.190 align:middle line:84%
But I went down for
one trip, and my clue

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:84%
was that I was working
on the woman thing.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden everything
she did teed me off.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And finally, it ended.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And I confronted her in
a meeting in the evening.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:06.610 align:middle line:90%
And well, I confronted her.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it
was the first time

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd ever done that
with a powerful woman.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd sniveled around and
manipulated and done

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.120 align:middle line:84%
this and that, but it was
the first time I just ever

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:84%
gotten somebody's
face and said, "No.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:25.300 align:middle line:90%
This is not right."

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And as it happened, it was
about as right as it wasn't.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, I had made my
move, and it changed my life.

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How so?

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.428 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well, Myrna.

00:39:37.428 --> 00:39:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about Myrna now.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:39.780 align:middle line:90%
We've got a little bit.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Just a few minutes left.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:41.738 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about Myrna.

00:39:41.738 --> 00:39:43.202 align:middle line:90%
Because this is really big.

00:39:43.202 --> 00:39:44.535 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah, it's really big.

00:39:44.535 --> 00:39:47.035 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To do a thing that
oftentimes men don't get around

00:39:47.035 --> 00:39:49.290 align:middle line:10%
until too late in life
and that's called care.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well, this is pretty--

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Myrna was
58 when I met her.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I was 53, somewhere like that.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Most beautiful
woman I'd ever seen.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Smartest person I've ever known.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Just amazing.

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Just an amazing person.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:84%
She was the launch
officer on Pioneer 5.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.040 align:middle line:10%
That sucker is still out
there beaming data back.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And when she got
out of aerospace,

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:90%
she became an art restorer.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And she worked on San Simeone.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, my
favorite picture of Myrna

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%
is on a platform around the
dome of the Griffith Park

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:84%
observatory with
scaffolding all over it.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And there are 140 guys and
one woman on that scaffolding.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the guys is the
director of the observatory,

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.500 align:middle line:84%
another one was the
architect on the project,

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest
of them are working

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.310 align:middle line:90%
for the woman, that was Myrna.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Myrna.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:54.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she was--

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.058 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
an amazing woman.

00:40:58.058 --> 00:40:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Oh, boy howdy.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.530 align:middle line:90%
We took up with each other.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:08.217 align:middle line:84%
And I think our first date was
to Whole Life Expo in Pasadena,

00:41:08.217 --> 00:41:09.050 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, mind
you-- by the way,

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I just want to put in here.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.860 align:middle line:84%
You'd also had an
experience with the Ouija

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.443 align:middle line:84%
board, some lucid dreaming, and
you were right on, by the way.

00:41:15.443 --> 00:41:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So you had an avid
open side of you,

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.306 align:middle line:84%
very mystical side of
you developing dream

00:41:21.306 --> 00:41:22.106 align:middle line:90%
throughout this.

00:41:22.106 --> 00:41:22.420 align:middle line:90%
So let's go ahead--

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But I still have
this big glitch.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
had the glitch.

00:41:25.935 --> 00:41:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And well, I still had
it when I took up with Myrna,

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.970 align:middle line:90%
and we split up.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were together
for a couple of years,

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.330 align:middle line:90%
then we split up for six years.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And then we got back together.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
taking classes from Don Miguel.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I went through--

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And then by the time
Myrna really needed me,

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:90%
I was ready to be needed.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was a whole
reversal-- role reversal.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.520 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's that role
you had never played,

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:10%
that of the caregiver, really.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, I
had to take the lead.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:06.530 align:middle line:90%
She was-- what's the word?

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.940 align:middle line:90%
She lost her marbles, basically.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.790 align:middle line:90%
She had dementia.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yeah.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:14.420 align:middle line:84%
She had dementia, and
it was very slow onset.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But OK, we used to
like to watch NCIS.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself explaining
the segment we just watched

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.708 align:middle line:90%
while the commercials ran.

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "Why
am I doing that?"

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:27.535 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized,
oh, she's not grasping.

00:42:27.535 --> 00:42:30.430 align:middle line:90%


00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And it progressed
and progressed.

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I had more
and more to do.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And then she got her
paralysis and that was--

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:42.710 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS] that was hard.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:43.510 align:middle line:90%
That was hard.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting because
she lost most of her looks,

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:84%
but nothing happened
to the love we had.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened to that.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And I remember when--

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a real soul
connection you had, finally.

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, real soul connection.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And when I started
going to the Toltec training,

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:05.410 align:middle line:90%
she was against it at first.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And then after about
almost a year, she said,

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.287 align:middle line:84%
"Whatever you're
doing, keep it up."

00:43:12.287 --> 00:43:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.660 align:middle line:90%
So this taught you humility.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.220 align:middle line:90%
It taught you service.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:84%
It taught you care,
really deep care.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, I just laid
all that resentment aside.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:24.460 align:middle line:90%
That was the big move.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, so that had to
have been a huge turning

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:29.140 align:middle line:90%
point in your own life.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.053 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:43:30.053 --> 00:43:31.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And it's
interesting because--

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.700 align:middle line:10%
I've noticed this.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm an observer, and I watch,
even generationally, people.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I
noticed with men--

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd see this in my
parents' generation,

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and my grandparents'
generation not quite

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.270 align:middle line:84%
as much, but definitely
my dad's generation.

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:10%
And that was, as
the men got older

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.900 align:middle line:10%
and they got past all the
testosterone-driven years

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:59.560 align:middle line:10%
and past all of the singularity
and focus and everything,

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:04.120 align:middle line:10%
that they started becoming
more open to others

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.160 align:middle line:10%
and the capacity
of care, wanting

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.410 align:middle line:10%
to be around, say,
their grandkids,

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.500 align:middle line:10%
maybe helping their wife out
around the house with stuff.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded
me of a film I saw

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.690 align:middle line:84%
that was so beautiful about
the development of males

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:17.560 align:middle line:90%
and females.

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And it starts out looking
at the backside short,

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.155 align:middle line:84%
looking at the backsides
of naked babies--

00:44:23.155 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:84%
a boy and a girl baby--
though it's the same.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Little potbellies
and cute, chubby.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.890 align:middle line:10%
And then it showed them as
they came into the puberty,

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:10%
and they started changing a bit.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Teenage years-- the men's
shoulders are widening,

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:90%
the girl has a small waist.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through life
all the way into, I think,

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.490 align:middle line:90%
it was like their 80s or so.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And at the back, their back
both looking like a baby.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:84%
A little bit pear shaped,
scrawny little legs,

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and they look the same from
behind, the men and the women.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.910 align:middle line:84%
We all go back where
we started in the end.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I learned a
lot from my stepfather,

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.190 align:middle line:90%
and my mother remarried again.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:00.220 align:middle line:90%


00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I was the best man.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:06.087 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: And I was 15, but I
went away to military school.

00:45:06.087 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:90%
And then I went away to college.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.010 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't around much.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:11.810 align:middle line:84%
But I learned a lot
from Bill Morris,

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.330 align:middle line:90%
who is a really smart guy.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me
one time, he said,

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:23.940 align:middle line:84%
"I will do anything to
make this marriage work."

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.027 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:45:25.027 --> 00:45:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: [CHUCKLES]

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is going to
ultimately come down

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:33.367 align:middle line:84%
to setting grievances aside,
resentments aside, and care.

00:45:33.367 --> 00:45:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Well, my
mother wasn't easy,

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:39.060 align:middle line:90%
and Bill was not milquetoast.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.590 align:middle line:84%
He didn't-- that's
no part of Bill.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] You
said his name was Morris.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:44.965 align:middle line:84%
So you took your
step dad's name?

00:45:44.965 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I took my
step dad's name, yeah.

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:48.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a story there, too,
but I'm not going to tell it.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're just about
out of time here.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.033 align:middle line:84%
One thing you did-- you
continued this journey,

00:45:54.033 --> 00:45:56.325 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, you've seen a
lot of my shows in the past.

00:45:56.325 --> 00:45:57.325 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Oh, boy howdy.

00:45:57.325 --> 00:46:00.207 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you really
started following some of the--

00:46:00.207 --> 00:46:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Well, that's it.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: Your show,
Gaia, in general.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:12.270 align:middle line:84%
But your show in particular, I
picked up, well, three times.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I've watched five
minutes of the interview,

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.310 align:middle line:84%
shut it down, gone to
Amazon, ordered the book,

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and then gone back
to the interview.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.278 align:middle line:84%
And those were
the emotion codes.

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Bradley Nelson.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Bradley Nelson.

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:25.947 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Eileen McKusick.

00:46:25.947 --> 00:46:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Eileen McKusick.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.587 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: She's my main--

00:46:28.587 --> 00:46:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She's wonderful.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:30.300 align:middle line:90%
I love Eileen.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.133 align:middle line:84%
I just interviewed her
last time I was here.

00:46:32.133 --> 00:46:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Two months ago.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Oh, well.

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.603 align:middle line:84%
I can-- it hasn't
aired yet though.

00:46:35.603 --> 00:46:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it
hasn't aired yet.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: OK.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:37.470 align:middle line:90%
I can hardly wait.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's wonderful.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:40.570 align:middle line:90%
She's really good.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I had a session
with her son, Cassidy.

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:52.790 align:middle line:84%
He wanted a distance
sonic healing session.

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Great kid.

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't know her son.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.620 align:middle line:84%
She just told me about
them, but I don't know--

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: She has two sons.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.530 align:middle line:84%
One's named after a Dylan
song and the others named

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:02.900 align:middle line:84%
after a Dead song,
which kind of--

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.767 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
like Grateful Dead?

00:47:04.767 --> 00:47:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Love them.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's interesting.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So the point is, here
you are, a young guy.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.120 align:middle line:90%
You're in the Vietnam War.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.620 align:middle line:84%
You're doing all
the things guys do.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.680 align:middle line:84%
You're plowing through women,
and they all had to be good

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:84%
looking or you
weren't interested.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.970 align:middle line:84%
You were the Marlboro man minus,
I don't know, the cigarettes,

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
were living your life.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in that
sense, we'd say, whoa,

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:27.060 align:middle line:90%
what's he doing here on Gaia?

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.140 align:middle line:10%
You're a totally different
kind of guy's guy,

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.150 align:middle line:10%
and this is mostly
female audience.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:34.700 align:middle line:84%
But the fact was, there
were all these things that

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:38.660 align:middle line:84%
were opening to spirit inside
you throughout your whole life.

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.165 align:middle line:84%
You just didn't even recognize
it at the time sometimes.

00:47:41.165 --> 00:47:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Not until Castaneda.

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: And OK.

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:49.110 align:middle line:84%
He was actually teaching
in LA when I lived there,

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.310 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't know it.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:54.740 align:middle line:84%
But his-- I wouldn't have
responded well to his teaching

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:57.560 align:middle line:84%
methods at all because he
used to humiliate people and--

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.738 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:58.738 --> 00:48:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: I was done with that
when I got out of high school.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But then I read The Four
Agreements, and I had a--

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful book.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yes, it is.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And I had a good relationship
with my friend, Judith Moore,

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:17.750 align:middle line:84%
who was an editor at
the San Diego Reader.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And during that
period, there were--

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:20.760 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sell anything.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.560 align:middle line:90%
I would just send--

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd write stuff and
send it to my friends.

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:26.900 align:middle line:90%
And Judith bought it, which--

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.670 align:middle line:84%
why was she buying
my war stories?

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Why was she-- but she did.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And she-- I had decided
I wanted to meet--

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking for a
teacher, a Toltec teacher.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been reading, and it
wasn't going to be Castaneda.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So I pitched an interview with
Miguel to the San Diego Reader,

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.830 align:middle line:90%
which I did.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.180 align:middle line:90%
It's three chapters of the book.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:59.390 align:middle line:90%
And so I interviewed Don Miguel.

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:05.280 align:middle line:84%
He took me to Teotihuacan,
that first trip.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't even begin.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can begin because
it's a chapter in the book.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But it would take another hour
to do it, and it was just--

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:17.640 align:middle line:90%
I was in.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.073 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to pursue that
as far as it would go.

00:49:20.073 --> 00:49:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wanted to
expand your awareness.

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.570 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to expand
your consciousness.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:25.445 align:middle line:84%
>>MORRIS: So I went into
apprentice programs,

00:49:25.445 --> 00:49:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and I went to Teo six
times, I went to Peru.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I went to Machu Picchu.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:32.985 align:middle line:90%
I went to Maui.

00:49:32.985 --> 00:49:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I went to--

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were a
man seeking yourself.

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MORRIS: Yes.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:40.810 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: And to the
degree that I found myself,

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:41.730 align:middle line:10%
that's where I did it.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you did it
at a time and in a generation

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't prone to
doing that, honestly.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.090 align:middle line:10%
That's probably why--

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:50.090 align:middle line:10%
>>MORRIS: Well, it's OK.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.980 align:middle line:10%
When I took the
jump course, which

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:56.910 align:middle line:10%
was a two-year apprenticeship
with HeatherAsh Amara, whom

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:01.530 align:middle line:10%
you have interviewed and her
husband at that time, Raven

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:02.520 align:middle line:10%
Smith.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.370 align:middle line:10%
And I debated about taking--

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.560 align:middle line:10%
I'll be 71 when
this course is over.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, I'll
be 71 when it's over,

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.000 align:middle line:90%
whether I take it or not.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:13.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So and that one, that's
a great line to end on.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:16.930 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing, it's
never too late, actually.

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:20.340 align:middle line:84%
It's never too late,
