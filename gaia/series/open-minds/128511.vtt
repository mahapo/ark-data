>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Women complain

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:10%
that men don't hear them,
and men complain that women

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:10%
don't give them space.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
According to Arjuna Aradagh
and John Gray in their newest

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.940 align:middle line:84%
book "Conscious Men," these
are legitimate complaints

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
because we're wired
totally differently.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
It's all down to oxytocin
and testosterone.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, a little
bit of re-education

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:84%
helps, right?
[CHUCKLING] Welcome.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Arjuna, how did
you and John decide

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:84%
to go into collaboration
to begin with?

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:10%
>>ARJUNA ARDAGH:
Well, actually I've

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:10%
known John Gray for more than 30
years, maybe close to 40 years.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.350 align:middle line:10%
We met when we
were both involved

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:10%
with Transcendental Meditation
and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:84%
John Gray was the secretary
to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi years

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:90%
ago when I was still a teenager.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:90%
But we connected more recently.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
We've been part of the
same men's group in Marin,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:84%
for Marin County, California,
for eight years now.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was really out of being
part of the same men's group.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I would stay at his
house sometimes.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
We would get into talking
about our men's group,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
then more broadly
about men in general.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And out of those
conversations-- I

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
would go to stay with him
because I lived too far

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:90%
away to drive home afterwards.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd go stay with him, and we'd
have a cup of tea at 10:00 PM,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and we'd still be talking
at 2:30 in the night.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.777 align:middle line:84%
And the third time
this happened, we said,

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:90%
why didn't we record this?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:84%
We're saying things that
have not been said before.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So that was how the whole
collaboration started.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you what
is your men's group in Marin?

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:90%
He's in Mill Valley, right?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.155 align:middle line:90%
I used to live there.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:90%
I just love Mill Valley.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:84%
What is the men's
group dedicated to?

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, I
think any men's group--

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.340 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] It's a funny thing
to talk about to a woman,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
actually, because it's--
any men's group, I think,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
is really dedicated to an
opportunity for men to support

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
each other in an
environment that's just men.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And actually in our book
"Conscious Men," probably

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle line:84%
the one recommendation
that we make in the book

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:84%
that we feel would apply, would
be good for absolutely any man

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
at all, is to be part
of a men's group.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:90%
It's phenomenal.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Every week or two
weeks or every month

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:84%
to spend a couple of
hours or three hours

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
where you're just in
a circle of men-- it's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:90%
amazing what happens.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:90%
It's the same for women.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
When you actually get into
a single-gender environment

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.970 align:middle line:84%
for a little while,
something really relaxes back

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
into a recognition
of-- [EXHALES]--

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.567 align:middle line:84%
this is what the masculine
is like when it's not

00:02:58.567 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:90%
in relationship to the feminine.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
important for men

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:84%
to have that, particular today
when we've got so much blending

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.592 align:middle line:84%
of gender roles, which is a
good thing, that all of us

00:03:09.592 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:84%
get to explore our masculine
and feminine side more than we

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.357 align:middle line:90%
did in previous generations.

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually a really
good thing now and then

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.399 align:middle line:84%
to have a break and
just be men together.

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know, it's funny.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I had dinner with
someone last night

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:84%
who is struggling in terms
of making a living at exactly

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
this, at trying to
help men go deeper

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
into themselves and for
men to gather together

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and getting men to
even gather together.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And he's been at this
for years and years.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I told him I'd be
interviewing you today,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and he said, what's
interesting is

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to me that that's
not in their nature,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.240 align:middle line:90%
joining together in a group.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know any men where
that's in their nature.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
It's something that would be a
conscious choice that they're

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:90%
doing for purpose.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.708 align:middle line:84%
And so it's almost like kind of
swimming upstream, so to speak.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.791 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: That's a very
interesting point, Regina.

00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think I would want to
slightly edit what you said.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I'd say
it's definitely very

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:90%
much not in our conditioning.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's in our nature
or not is a different thing.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
the conditioning,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
because when men put energy
into being with other men,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:84%
it means they're putting value
on bonding with other men.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the message
we got from our fathers

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and forefathers about
making relationship

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:90%
with other men primary?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
We were conditioned with
homophobia, basically, right?

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hard
to believe, but I

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
think until 1965, which
was within my lifetime,

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.760 align:middle line:84%
homosexuality was illegal
in England, right?

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:90%
It was only legalized--

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yet practiced widely.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Now, of course,
many marry other men.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But for the first
seven years of my life

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
or eight years of my life,
I was told that for a man

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:90%
to love another man is illegal.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:90%
You can go to prison for it.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And then if we get into
kind of immoral and not

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
fit in the eyes of God, I mean,
we're way, way over the edge

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So we grew up to believe
that getting too close

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:90%
to another man was dangerous.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's a conditioning that
many of us, we have to reverse.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have to recognize
that of course as men there's

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous nourishment and
value to bonding with a woman

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and, maybe if you're
heterosexual to being married.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous value
to being a father, bonding

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:90%
with your children.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous value
to creating good teamwork

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:90%
with other coworkers.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But actually putting value,
putting value on relationship

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle line:84%
with another man or
other men, that's

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:84%
something we have to
decondition ourselves

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see as important.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with that,
as someone observing

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, obviously,
and also the hypocrisy

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and what that created by
way of cognitive disconnect

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
with in England, for
example, with boys

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
in public-- "public" meaning
private in our parlance--

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.437 align:middle line:84%
school, where
homosexuality was common.

00:06:07.437 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Even if you weren't-- you didn't
have to be homosexual to have

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:84%
a sexual experience with another
boy or a teacher or your music

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:90%
teacher, whomever.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know with a lot
of boys that created

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:90%
a lot of damage and confusion.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah, well, it
was commonly practiced

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.315 align:middle line:90%
but not in any sense condoned.

00:06:27.315 --> 00:06:28.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:06:28.115 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So it
was something that

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.660 align:middle line:84%
happened with a tremendous
amount of guilt and shame

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:90%
and tension.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And that created
a lot of problems.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And then yet at
the same time, when

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:84%
you talk to men, older
men, for example--

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I notice my dad's generation--
what were the great years?

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And they'd be like, well,
World War II or the Korean War,

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.971 align:middle line:90%
where men had to--

00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:49.303 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: --bond with other men.

00:06:49.303 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --practice courage
and reliance upon one another.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Those were the great
moments in life.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But to get together in a
group and talk about things

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:90%
is a whole different thing.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, this is
a really important point

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:90%
that you're focusing on here.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It's probably one of
the strongest reasons

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
to write this book, is that most
of us as men, we kind of need

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:90%
a rethink on this.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
We need to become conscious,
anyway, of our needs

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and realize that bonding deeply
with other men for the sake

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
of bonding deeply with
other men is actually

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:90%
a need that men have.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And if they fulfill
that need, they

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:84%
become deeper, more
accountable, happier men.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.304 align:middle line:84%
Now, the little
illustration we give

00:07:29.304 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
in the book about this,
which I think really kind of

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
shines a light on
it, most men, if they

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
were having a conflict or
difficulty in marriage,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
would not hesitate to go
for counseling, right?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Most men, if they had a
challenge with a teenage child,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't hesitate to
go for counseling.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:84%
If you had a challenge
with a coworker,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:84%
you would see mediation
as appropriate.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's very rare for a man to
have conflict with another man

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.979 align:middle line:84%
and to be willing to get help to
resolve it or to go to therapy

00:07:56.979 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
because you're having a
problem your best friend.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.650 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't do that.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:90%
It would be weird.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.365 align:middle line:84%
A woman, on the other hand,
might be willing to do that.

00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But you see, that's
because we're

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
so deeply conditioned
to not value

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:90%
our friendships with other men.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's a
really pivotal, pivotal thing

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:84%
in being able to
grow, because a man

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
needs the challenge and
the support of other men

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:90%
to be able to fully blossom.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to be able
to get that from his wife

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:90%
or from a woman.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And you bring up in the
book that in the past,

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:84%
men's status in society,
their heroism, so to speak,

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
came from unconscious patterns,
where you were inducted

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
into the military,
for example, you

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:84%
were following in your
father's footsteps

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:90%
as a blacksmith in your work.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And your life was
defined for you,

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.200 align:middle line:84%
but it was never a
conscious choice.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
really good point.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it struck
me that now that we

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
have the possibility
of conscious choice,

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:84%
it requires men to become
completely conscious

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Right.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm just having a little
bit of a shock here

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
because it's unusual for
me to do an interview

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.656 align:middle line:84%
where someone's read the
book this thoroughly.

00:09:07.656 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow,
you've read the book.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So many interviewers,
they've skimmed it.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I always do.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: But you've
really gone through deeply.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:90%
That's very nice.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're making
a good point.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.202 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.202 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
One thing we
distinguish in the book

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:84%
is there are different,
you could say,

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:84%
dispositions of masculinity
that we see today.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And if it's OK with you, I'm
going to just briefly label

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.060 align:middle line:84%
four of them, because
it will illustrate what

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:90%
conscious masculinity means.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So one disposition, which
is still very prevalent,

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:43.230 align:middle line:84%
is to run on the automatic
conditioning that's been there

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%
That means a man's enduring.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.411 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't feel his feelings.

00:09:47.411 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Relationship is not
very important to him.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:84%
He's probably somewhat
absent as a father.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
He just gets the job done
and doesn't look back.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:59.275 align:middle line:84%
And even though probably in
New York or San Francisco

00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
or something, that
may seem very dated,

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
in many parts of the country,
many parts of the world,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that is still very much alive,
the old traditional macho,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.371 align:middle line:84%
masked man who probably
disdains feminism and women

00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:90%
having more empowerment.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't like that.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.205 align:middle line:84%
So that's one disposition
of masculine, which

00:10:17.205 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%
is purely conditioned, right?

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is also another
kind of disposition,

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
which I would say is equally
to some degree conditioned,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:84%
which is a reflex reaction to
that, which we in the book,

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:84%
we call it the
feminization of men, OK?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's a man who realizes
that all of that conditioning,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
that macho masculinity,
was an imprisonment

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, overreacts
by going the other way.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
He goes really
into his feelings.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:84%
He just follows what
intuitively feels right to him.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:90%
He ceases to be accountable.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.300 align:middle line:90%
He becomes very empathetic.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And the primary problem that
we see with that-- I mean,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:84%
there are many problems, but the
primary problem that men come

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.970 align:middle line:84%
to John or me for counseling
for or for support--

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.739 align:middle line:84%
is that the polarity, the
sexual polarity with women

00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:90%
just goes out the window.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not there.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Women are not
attracted to a feminized man,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So even though there are some
good things about a man being

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:84%
in touch with his feelings,
too much feminization,

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that's one problem,
is in relationship,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:90%
but also a man loses his edge.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
He loses his sense of direction.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:84%
If a man is too much
influenced by feeling and not

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:84%
enough by keeping his word,
he gets lost and confused

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.527 align:middle line:90%
and uncented.

00:11:28.527 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
There is now a third-- I'm
going to give you four.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The third disposition is what we
could call learned masculinity

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:90%
or imitated masculinity.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's another, I would
say, another problem, actually,

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
is men read books
about how to be

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.710 align:middle line:84%
a better man or a superior man
or a better man or something.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:84%
They read a book and go,
oh, I should be like this.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they learn,
OK, I'm here, and I'm

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:90%
really present with you.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of somewhat
serious and studied

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.850 align:middle line:90%
and imitated.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not embodied.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, it's certainly--
there's a lot of effort in it.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I think
we've discovered

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:84%
is you just have to
poke a man a little bit

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
who's got this sort of imitated
masculinity, and it crumbles.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:84%
There's no humor in
it, and it's not really

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:90%
authentic or natural flowing.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It's imitated.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:84%
It may be a good
phase to go through.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth
kind of masculinity

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.282 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about,
which John and I-- I

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
don't think we would want
to have the arrogance

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:84%
to say that we are
examples of this

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:84%
any more than anybody else, but
we're good at expressing ideas.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:90%
We're articulate wordsmiths.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:90%
We write books.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So we want to give
voice to something,

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
which is the possibility of a
man becoming familiar enough

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
with his biology,
with his conditioning,

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
to understand his conditioning,
a deep enough sense

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
of his intuition,
of his potential

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.480 align:middle line:84%
that his masculinity
becomes conscious.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Instead of some
kind of conditioned

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
traditional masculine
or reaction to it

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
or studied masculinity
from a book,

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
he actually reconnects
with himself, sometimes

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
through a retreat or
solitude, and he realizes,

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm here for a few
decades on this planet,

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
kind of gift that I

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
want to give as a father,
as a partner, as a leader.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the way that
I want to show up.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.930 align:middle line:90%
And that would be conscious.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't need to show
up in any particular way.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:84%
What we aim to do with our
book is not to provide answers,

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.830 align:middle line:84%
but to provide questions, not
to tell a man how he should be

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:84%
or there's any formula,
but to be able to ask,

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
what kind of man
do you want to be?

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:84%
What's the kind of masculinity
you can live so that one day

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
when you die, you can go,
ah, yes, I gave fully.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think in a
way-- and here I

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:84%
am walking that
edge of arrogance,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:90%
but I'll give it a shot.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that's in a
way what motivated

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.840 align:middle line:84%
John and myself to
write this book,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that somehow we've
both just fallen

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
into a masculinity-- it's
different for both of us,

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:84%
but we've fallen into a
masculinity for each of us

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.990 align:middle line:84%
where we feel comfortable
with our own skin.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
We both, I think, feel
that we could die one day

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and feel that we lived
the way we chose to live.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't either
condition or a reaction.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's something we'd like
to pass on to other people.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it's
interesting generationally

00:14:35.244 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
speaking, because you're
of a particular generation

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:84%
where it's really maybe
the first generation where

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:47.359 align:middle line:84%
real conscious choice was
made and possible at large,

00:14:47.359 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to our parents'
generation, which were still

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
kind of running on the
programs of what was expected,

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't explore these
subjects often en masse, right?

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take a look
at what's happening

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.755 align:middle line:90%
with the 20-something males.

00:15:04.755 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And I just had this
conversation, in fact,

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:84%
in California a couple
days ago with someone,

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:84%
saying their sons are
failing to launch.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are college
educated-- not all.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They tend to move back home,
play video games, smoke weed.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.144 align:middle line:84%
It's like girls are
way too complex.

00:15:27.144 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
They're just too
much of a hassle.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to engage.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe we'll get
to this subject, too.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's artificial
constructs, porn and so forth.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
generation of young men

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:84%
who are not standing
up to purpose.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Now they're very young still,
so they have time to grow.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
But there doesn't seem to be
any motivation toward that

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Right.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So interesting
question-- John and I,

00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.320 align:middle line:84%
although we are both baby
boomers, I can say for myself,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.940 align:middle line:84%
my clients, the people I choose
to work with in coaching,

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
are very much from that
millennial generation,

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.260 align:middle line:90%
20s, early 30s.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So I do experience a lot of
what you're talking about.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we're
seeing in that generation,

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
the millennials, is parents who
were baby boomers, who didn't

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
want to pass on
to their children

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:84%
the rigidity and the
strict boundaries

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:90%
that we had imposed on us.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.216 align:middle line:84%
And so we overreact, and
we become very permissive.

00:16:37.216 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the thing.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:84%
For a girl, a teenage
girl, being encouraged

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
to feel and to be intuitive
and to follow her instinct

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:84%
is actually encouraging
her femininity.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
For a young man, we don't
want to throw the baby out

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:90%
with the bathwater, right?

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So we certainly, I
think, want to be

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
more aware of this gender
stereotyping that a lot of us

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
suffered from, but
at the same time,

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:84%
there is understanding
about male biology that

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:84%
goes back thousands of
years in many traditions.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't reject all
of that out of hand.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Because there have traditionally
been rites of passage

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:84%
for young men, which
usually involve

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
the awakening, the
cultivation of a quality

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
of endurance, enduring
challenge, enduring difficulty.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Courage?

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah, that's
another element.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
part of it, yeah.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Another
element, but I'm

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
going to focus right now
specifically on endurance.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Endurance means-- and endurace,
endure-- it's from Latin.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:84%
It means to make
strong, to make hard.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
It's actually how
you make metal hard.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dure.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Durus
is the Latin word.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
we're talking about masculine,

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about hard.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So how does a man
become hard, strong?

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously physically
he lifts weights, right?

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:84%
He does physical things, so his
muscles become hard, not soft.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But in the same way, a young
man learns how to keep his word,

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.550 align:middle line:84%
to be true, to move through
things to a goal, which is

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:90%
what testosterone is all about.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
He learns how to
do that by going

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
through difficult
challenges and coming

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:84%
out victorious on
the other side.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.970 align:middle line:84%
If the challenge is
too easy, it doesn't

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:90%
make him sufficiently strong.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:84%
If the challenge is to
difficult, it conditions

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:90%
him to failure.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's the right
level of challenge.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And that has been the
essence of a rite of passage,

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:84%
which has been there in many
traditions in different ways,

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.180 align:middle line:90%
see.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we're
missing that now.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:84%
A friend of ours, John and
mine, a friend of ours Warren

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Farrell, he and John has written
a book called "The Boy Crisis."

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's about the
fact that we don't

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
have-- 50% of young
men growing up

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:84%
don't have a father
present in the house--

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary statistic, right?

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.230 align:middle line:84%
So I do meet a lot of
young men like this.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.547 align:middle line:84%
And actually the key that
I've discovered-- I'm

00:19:14.547 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
really excited to
share this with you,

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:84%
because you were asking about
young millennial young men.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
The key, actually,
is to understand

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:84%
the cycle, the biological
cycle, of how testosterone

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and dopamine and
serotonin work together.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is how it
works very simply.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
This does not apply
until puberty,

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
but once a man
comes into puberty--

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to build up
between 13, 14 and about 25.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:84%
During that period, a
young man needs to learn--

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's not
necessarily instinctive.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:90%
It has to be trained.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:84%
A young man needs to
learn how to make promises

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that he is somehow able to
keep with a little edge.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't
require little edge,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.791 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to do
anything-- with a little bit

00:20:01.791 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
of push-through, a
promise he can keep.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens when a
young man, or any age of man,

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:90%
makes a promise and keeps it?

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The testosterone
required to push through

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and to check something
off in a box--

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:84%
it's a very important
thing for men,

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.984 align:middle line:84%
is checking things
off on boxes, right?

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:21.369 align:middle line:84%
Not so much for women,
and if a woman does that,

00:20:21.369 --> 00:20:22.660 align:middle line:90%
she's going into her masculine.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
But when a man goes check,
actually his testosterone

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
depletion or release
of testosterone

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:84%
switches momentarily
into dopamine,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and he feels psychologically
he has earned the right

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:90%
to rest and relax.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So depending upon the magnitude
of the task, if a man like

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.950 align:middle line:84%
actually types the last
period on a book he's writing,

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
it's like massive
dopamine release.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So then he actually
feels he has the right

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:90%
to be still, to relax.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And that earned right releases
dopamine into the brain,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:84%
together with some serotonin,
but it's mostly about dopamine.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And that particular biological
environment of dopamine

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
is the precursor to the
replenishment of testosterone,

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
to replenishing
testosterone reserves.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the replenishment
of the reserve

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:84%
actually means that he's got
fresh testosterone in his blood

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
to be able to take on a slightly
bigger challenge the next day,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.510 align:middle line:84%
which means now he can push
through, keep his word,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:90%
do what he said.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:84%
He'll get an even bigger
dopamine response,

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:84%
he feels even better
about himself,

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:84%
and that cycle is how a man
builds confidence and builds

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.980 align:middle line:84%
the motivation to
want to do things.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
breaks that thing

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
about wanting to go back
to live with your parents

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and smoke weed and
play video games.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.120 align:middle line:84%
That instinct is because a young
man has lost that feeling of,

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:84%
He's actually trained himself
to feel, I can't do this.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But if a man trains himself
or is trained through hell to,

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.150 align:middle line:84%
yes, I did it, I
broke through, he's

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:84%
going to wake up early the
next morning eager to do

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:90%
another one.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's how
I trained my two boys.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I've got a son of
23 and a son of 20.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And thanks be to God, they
don't have any of that.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:84%
My youngest son left
home at 17 because he

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
was motivated to-- he's
got a dog, he's got a car,

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:90%
he lives now in Truckee.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
He's the top ski
coach for the ski team

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
at North Star, which is a
great accomplishment at 20.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it
is, absolutely.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.536 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: He's coaching
the national team.

00:22:39.536 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:90%
And he's all about that.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:42.762 align:middle line:90%
He's like, yes, I could do it.

00:22:42.762 --> 00:22:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And now he's always
looking for new challenges.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I've done this,
now I can do that.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that cascade
of chemicals is in itself--

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to use the word
addictive, but it is addictive.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I did with my
boys-- and I don't know.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a
father present for me.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So I had to really make
it up as I went along.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:84%
But what I did with my
boys is I really operated

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:84%
throughout their
childhood and adolescence

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that there was no free lunch--
no free lunch in my house,

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Which meant basically
that I bought

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
them birthday presents
and Christmas presents,

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:84%
but everything else--
and I provided then

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:90%
food and a roof and heating.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But everything else
they had to earn.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But I was paying
them to do things

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.580 align:middle line:84%
at a ridiculous
rate for their age.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So if we were going to build
a deck, my little son of six

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
would be holding the bucket of
nails and passing me the nails.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:84%
He's getting $15 an hour to
hold the nail bucket, right?

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.007 align:middle line:84%
And then I told him,
if you save the money,

00:23:46.007 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
if you put the money
into an account save it

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.465 align:middle line:84%
until you're ready
to buy a bigger item

00:23:49.465 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and don't fritter
it, I'll double it.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.399 align:middle line:84%
So my kids were
buying their own--

00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:84%
what's that thing
called that you-- I

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:90%
forget what it's called.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A little Gameboy.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Gameboy--
they were buying

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.430 align:middle line:90%
that with their own money.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:90%
They bought their own computers.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:84%
They bought everything
from money they saved.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, they complained bitterly
in their teenage years and said,

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
my friends' parents--
my friends don't have

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:90%
to pay for their cell phone.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:90%
The parents provide it.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:84%
My parents provide
all these things.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.789 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, but your parents
don't pay their children

00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:90%
to take the garbage out, right?

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.445 align:middle line:90%
They have to do it anyway.

00:24:22.445 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different
system in my house.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.361 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't like your system!

00:24:25.361 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, tough, because
this is who you're living with.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.272 align:middle line:84%
But I just stayed with
it, and I said basically

00:24:32.272 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:90%
there's no free lunch.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:90%
You earn everything.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, my kids have grown up
to not expect free lunch.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And so now, as I said,
they're 20 and 23.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of them have
asked me for money for years.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if we out to dinner,
they take pride in paying.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Dad, look, we'll
treat you for dinner.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Because they're both
earning, you see.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's really worked out.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was just
guesswork on my part,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't have
any role model myself.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.034 align:middle line:84%
My father left when I was little
and wasn't much in my life.

00:25:05.034 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
But this has just
worked out well.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's something
I would recommend to anybody

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:90%
raising boys, basically.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:84%
It even works well with
girls, but raising boys,

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.732 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
provide that training,

00:25:18.732 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and then they feel
good about themselves.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Both my sons have
extraordinarily high

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:90%
self-esteem.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.149 align:middle line:84%
They just have
this, I can do this.

00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's not so much arrogance.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just a feeling of, that's
not a challenge; I can do it.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but they've
been proving it to themselves

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.572 align:middle line:84%
over and over
throughout their lives.

00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:33.371 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:25:33.371 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: That's the key,
is when a man accomplishes

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.770 align:middle line:84%
something and checks
it off, yes, he's

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:84%
more accountable
to other people,

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
but what's much more important
is that a man can trust himself

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And I think that is the key.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.596 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
now we're going

00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:56.110 align:middle line:84%
to get into the
dynamic with women,

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
because the book is written as
much for women, if not more.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's key, because if a
man stays true to their word

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and is 100% in that,
that's the only way

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:84%
women are ever going to relax
around them and really trust

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, it's
interesting you pick up

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.180 align:middle line:84%
on the piece about
100% accountable,

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
because I've got to make
a little disclosure here.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
In the book we talk
about 12 qualities

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:90%
of conscious masculinity.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And this thing about
keeping the word,

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that's like the weakest
for me, personally.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do not
have any credibility

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.800 align:middle line:90%
to write about that.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's a very
difficult area for me,

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:84%
so I know about the challenges
of that, of following through.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:90%
I tend to just overcommit.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.594 align:middle line:84%
I tend to promise
completely unrealistically.

00:26:39.594 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you set yourself
up to break your word.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly, exactly.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.803 align:middle line:90%
So I've found ways to handle it.

00:26:43.803 --> 00:26:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
an important piece

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.700 align:middle line:84%
about this book,
is we absolutely

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.870 align:middle line:84%
don't want to write a book,
either for men to read

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:84%
or for women to read, which
paints a picture of how

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.024 align:middle line:84%
a man should be, like
this is the perfect man

00:27:00.024 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:90%
and anything else is--

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Because neither
John nor I would measure up

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:90%
to all 12 of these.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:84%
What we aim to do
in this book is

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to say, we would like to be
able to pass on what we know so

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.050 align:middle line:84%
that a man can feel
good about himself

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and so that the
people in his life,

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.890 align:middle line:84%
primarily if he's in a
relationship with a woman so

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.980 align:middle line:84%
the woman in his life,
but also his children,

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
can also feel that they
are benefited by him,

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:84%
that they are nourished by him,
that it's a gift to have him

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:90%
in their lives, right?

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done,
actually, in the book

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:84%
is we've determined 12 qualities
of conscious masculinity.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
not a single man

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.849 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, including me
and John, who perfectly--

00:27:47.849 --> 00:27:49.723 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who possess
all of them, of course.

00:27:49.723 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly, who
perfectly embody all of them.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.355 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
just interjecting

00:27:53.355 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
that because that's
personal to me.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I was raised by a man who
was kind and gentle and--

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Your father.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Purposeful, never
broke his word.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I
became conditioned to

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.273 align:middle line:84%
and was quite shocked when
I went out in the world

00:28:09.273 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and realized people break
their word all the time.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:90%
I have a real problem with that.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe that's just a
personal thing, because that's

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.630 align:middle line:84%
what allows me to just
kind of relax a bit,

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:84%
is if I know someone's
good for their word.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm totally unsettled
if they're not right.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.584 align:middle line:84%
Although that's only one trait,
and maybe for other women

00:28:27.584 --> 00:28:28.500 align:middle line:90%
it's not so important.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I think a very important
thing in reading

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:84%
this book is to realize nobody's
going to be 100% on everything.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: The key is
mindfulness, really,

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:44.180 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
recognize, OK, I'm a man,

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.582 align:middle line:90%
and here are some qualities.

00:28:45.582 --> 00:28:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of them may not be
important to me at all,

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:90%
so that's freedom.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But here are some qualities
that we've determined cause men

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:84%
to feel good about themselves,
but also cause women

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:90%
to be attracted to men as well.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So how am I doing in
these 12 qualities?

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And would I like support
with some of them?

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like support, if
a man would like support

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:84%
in any of these
qualities-- there

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.690 align:middle line:84%
are 12 of them--
the book provides

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.975 align:middle line:84%
a tons of practical tools for
how to cultivate that quality.

00:29:12.975 --> 00:29:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And even, for example,
on this one quality

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about, standing
by your word, if someone were

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:84%
to screw up in that way and
whatever, it didn't work out,

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:84%
to just be aware of it,
conscious of it, address it

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:34.149 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'm really sorry that
I wasn't unable to do that, this

00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and this and this
happened, so at least you

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:84%
know it's being addressed
and not just shuffled

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:84%
away somewhere,
swept under the rug,

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
to consciously face things
that don't go well, too.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:90%
This is a really big deal.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And instead of feeling,
oh, God, if I even

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:84%
say anything about it,
she's going to rag on me,

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and being afraid to address
things when they don't go well.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.985 align:middle line:84%
But OK, so getting into
the female part of it--

00:29:56.985 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Let's just pick
up on one thing you said,

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.109 align:middle line:84%
which will be a good segue
into the female part,

00:30:01.109 --> 00:30:03.160 align:middle line:84%
because you said, "Oh, I
shouldn't bring this up.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:90%
She'll rag on me."

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that
might possibly

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.704 align:middle line:84%
be an intelligent thing
to think for a woman.

00:30:08.704 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:90%


00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And this will be a
good segue into talking

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:90%
about men and women.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:84%
There are mistakes
that I make in my life.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.310 align:middle line:10%
I have what I consider to be
a really good relationship

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:10%
with my wife Chameli.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:33.920 align:middle line:84%
We're 14 years into a very
engaging and rich and not

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.477 align:middle line:84%
boring and fulfilling union,
where we have a lot of freedom

00:30:38.477 --> 00:30:40.060 align:middle line:84%
to do what we want
to do in our lives,

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:84%
but we know that
we're absolutely there

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.590 align:middle line:90%
for each other.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I make mistakes
in my life all the time.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm playing a
fairly big playing field

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.170 align:middle line:84%
with running a coaching
school internationally.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And I make mistakes.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I've
learned it's probably best

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:84%
not to go to her as my first
resource in needing support.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I agree with that.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying if
you screw up, it's

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.020 align:middle line:90%
good to just address it face on.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:10.820 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: What I do--
it's a good segue.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.784 align:middle line:84%
What I'll do is I'll
go to her and say,

00:31:13.784 --> 00:31:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm facing this
challenge right now,

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:84%
or I'm sorry I
didn't do this thing,

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'm handling it with someone
who can really support me.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But I've kind of learned
to bring to my wife

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:84%
my strength, my gift, not to go
to her wanting help or support.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I go to a man friend or
to my men's group when

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I need support, or I'll go
to a paid coach or a paid

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:90%
consultant.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:37.846 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:37.846 --> 00:31:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
wisdom in that, yes.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you were
talking about lists

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and how men tick off the list.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And they have an
increase in testosterone

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and all of this chemical
cascade to encourage

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:84%
even more-- if you want to
call that responsible behavior

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
in the future, where if I see
a list, for example, if I have

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:84%
a long list of
things to do, I find

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:90%
it overwhelming and depressing.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll get to
it, I'll get to it,

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:08.255 align:middle line:84%
but it's like blah, like
this, until it's over with.

00:32:08.255 --> 00:32:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
opposite response.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.637 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about what
happened in two stories

00:32:12.637 --> 00:32:13.720 align:middle line:90%
that you put in your book.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.690 align:middle line:84%
One is John going to
Norway on a TV show.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was the
prime minister there

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.554 align:middle line:84%
he was speaking with
or something like that.

00:32:21.554 --> 00:32:22.594 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah, I forget.

00:32:22.594 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It was the prime minister, and
it was two senior government

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:25.600 align:middle line:90%
officials.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, basically
saying there's no difference.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Men and women are
completely equal.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no difference
between the two.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And then a study
comes out in Sweden

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.620 align:middle line:84%
saying women are four times more
stressed out in the workforce

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.580 align:middle line:90%
than men are.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.675 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: OK, I must admit
that was something happened

00:32:42.675 --> 00:32:44.640 align:middle line:84%
with John, but yeah,
I mean what he's

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:84%
focusing on there is the
idea of gender neutrality.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:49.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's legitimate.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a well-founded idea
that in previous generations

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.131 align:middle line:84%
there's been such a
stereotype, and you're a boy,

00:32:57.131 --> 00:32:59.755 align:middle line:84%
you should be like this; you're
a girl, you should be like this

00:32:59.755 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and wear a pink dress
and pink-- And then,

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of course, the corollary to
that is, if you're a boy,

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.360 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go to war,
you've got to endure,

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.943 align:middle line:84%
you've got to work
long hours, there's

00:33:08.943 --> 00:33:10.887 align:middle line:90%
no pleasure for you, young man.

00:33:10.887 --> 00:33:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a girl, oh, you're
going to stay in the kitchen,

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.385 align:middle line:84%
but you don't get to
express your creativity.

00:33:15.385 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously we
don't want that, right?

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And then of course
part of that--

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But to say
there's no difference

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:90%
is an extreme overreaction.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Well, I believe so.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.351 align:middle line:90%
Now, not everybody believes so.

00:33:25.351 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
it's an overreaction

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's true that
there are many stereotypes.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.817 align:middle line:84%
Like we used to say
women couldn't vote.

00:33:34.817 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously now that's
ridiculous, we realize.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody in
their right mind--

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.216 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we didn't
possess the intelligence.

00:33:39.216 --> 00:33:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Nobody in their right mind
would suggest that today.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And then in the '70s,
women claimed their right

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.910 align:middle line:84%
to be doctors and lawyers
and prime minister.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.990 align:middle line:84%
All of that was thought
to be inappropriate.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Now we've realized women
can do just as good a job

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.830 align:middle line:84%
at all those things,
often better, right?

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So we've realized a lot of
that stereotyping was bogus.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing, OK?

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.910 align:middle line:90%
A man has testicles.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.730 align:middle line:90%
He's producing testosterone.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:90%
He ejaculates semen.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.219 align:middle line:90%
A woman has a menstrual cycle.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.340 align:middle line:90%
She's capable of bearing a baby.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.670 align:middle line:84%
She has more
estrogen in her body.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:90%
She's got ovaries.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We can't say all those things
are a social construct.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:84%
These physical differences,
those are real, right?

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, Yes.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: And because there
are physical differences,

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.320 align:middle line:84%
there are also
hormonal differences,

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.868 align:middle line:84%
which cause a difference in
the way you respond to life.

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:32.159 align:middle line:90%
And those are real differences.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is peppered
throughout the whole book,

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that we do respond
very differently.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.130 align:middle line:84%
As you say, men need that
down time, the alone time,

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.300 align:middle line:84%
maybe talk with a
friend, just to get out

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.046 align:middle line:84%
of this fear of what's going
on in their relationship

00:34:46.046 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:90%
when things are challenged.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Just don't chase them
down the hallway.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.699 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore,
just let them go

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:54.830 align:middle line:84%
so they can process and
come back to center.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Where women are going
to call up a girlfriend

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.630 align:middle line:90%
or something and their sister.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.780 align:middle line:90%
They want to collaborate.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:84%
They want to download all this
until their nervous system

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.460 align:middle line:84%
starts calming down in
that that's very typical.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:84%
It's been throughout
history that way.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Right.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's a hormonal
thing, you see.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.480 align:middle line:84%
When a woman is stressed
out and overwhelmed

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and she calls someone
on the phone or talks

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:18.130 align:middle line:84%
to a friend, particularly a
girlfriend, within 20 minutes

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:19.910 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
a surge in oxytocin.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Rate, connection and--

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin neutralizes the
adrenaline, cortisol,

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
which was stress,
and she actually

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.400 align:middle line:84%
feels connected
with herself again.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:84%
She learns to trust
herself again.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.699 align:middle line:84%
She knows she can make
the right decision.

00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:90%
That does not happen for a man.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:41.630 align:middle line:84%
The man has got a spike in
cortisol and adrenaline.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Talking to somebody
else is going

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.397 align:middle line:90%
to make him more confused.

00:35:44.397 --> 00:35:46.730 align:middle line:84%
He's gonna just-- blah-- he's
gonna to be spinning more.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.870 align:middle line:90%
What he needs is withdraw.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:84%
What we know now is that a man
has a much greater capacity

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:84%
to make the world go
away than a woman does.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.020 align:middle line:84%
When a man-- if he just closes
the door, shuts everything out,

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:84%
even if it's to watch
a football game,

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.860 align:middle line:84%
if he just shuts
everything out, he

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.730 align:middle line:84%
can forget his
troubles very quickly.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:84%
That causes dopamine to
be released in the brain.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Dopamine, serotonin causes
the neutralization of stress.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.162 align:middle line:84%
Then he comes out, and
he's more centered.

00:36:14.162 --> 00:36:15.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much
he's now following

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.720 align:middle line:84%
his intuition or
his heart, but he's

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.530 align:middle line:84%
like, I know the
right thing to do.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.460 align:middle line:84%
He feels a renewed capacity to
keep his word no matter what.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And then he feels
good about himself.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:29.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then again how
people process stress,

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.139 align:middle line:84%
like that study
in Sweden showed--

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I was chatting with a girl the
other day who's in med school.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.846 align:middle line:90%
She's going to be a surgeon.

00:36:35.846 --> 00:36:38.340 align:middle line:90%
She said, ah-- she's Hungarian.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.840 align:middle line:84%
(HUNGARIAN ACCENT)
Yeah, I just read

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.560 align:middle line:84%
a study that says
female surgeons

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.020 align:middle line:84%
lower their lifespan by 10
additional years to men.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.324 align:middle line:84%
And I said, makes
perfect sense to me.

00:36:51.324 --> 00:36:52.740 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I'm
reading this book.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I was just reading
this-- I was reading

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:56.150 align:middle line:84%
the book at the same
time, not at that moment,

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.390 align:middle line:84%
but I had been
earlier in the day.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, it
makes perfect sense.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
different way to process

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:04.500 align:middle line:84%
that very focused kind of
stress that a surgeon would have

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.470 align:middle line:84%
to go through, which can be
extremely depleting for women

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and can actually be
energizing in a way for men.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, what
I would suggest,

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.327 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just guessing here--

00:37:16.327 --> 00:37:18.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She decided maybe
she should go into dermatology.

00:37:18.785 --> 00:37:20.377 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] I thought
it was funny.

00:37:20.377 --> 00:37:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I think what would
be interesting to find out,

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:27.210 align:middle line:84%
if a woman became a
surgeon but was actually

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:84%
trained in a school where
all the teachers were women

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and then went into
a hospital where

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.970 align:middle line:84%
it was women who had
set up the thing,

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I doubt that
statistic would apply.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That may
be, because she's

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to squeeze into
a male-dominated world.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:45.447 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the key point that
applies to so many women today.

00:37:45.447 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: As a woman,
she's legitimate,

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I would say, in wanting
to be a doctor or the CEO

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.814 align:middle line:90%
or a prime minister or whatever.

00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And capable.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.729 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: She's capable.

00:37:56.729 --> 00:37:59.870 align:middle line:84%
But she's trying to fit
into a world that was set up

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.320 align:middle line:84%
to run on testosterone,
which means it was set up

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to run on push through, push
through, push through, push

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.280 align:middle line:84%
through, score a goal
and you can relax.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.770 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't work
well for women.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, right here-- we're
sitting in Boulder today.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Right here in this
same area where we are

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a publishing company
called Sounds True founded

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:90%
by Tammy Simon.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.430 align:middle line:84%
That's a really good
example of a company, which

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.520 align:middle line:84%
was founded by a
woman, not entirely

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.257 align:middle line:84%
but mostly run by
women, and it's

00:38:26.257 --> 00:38:28.340 align:middle line:84%
an environment that's
really comfortable for women

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.390 align:middle line:90%
to thrive in.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.199 align:middle line:84%
Women can bring
their dogs into work,

00:38:31.199 --> 00:38:32.490 align:middle line:90%
bring their children into work.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:84%
It's an environment where
women don't get stressed

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's a publishing
company set up from the get-go

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.340 align:middle line:90%
not run on--

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.037 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to
establish community

00:38:43.037 --> 00:38:43.995 align:middle line:90%
instead of competition.

00:38:43.995 --> 00:38:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Now we're seeing that happening
more and more and more as women

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.406 align:middle line:84%
are integrated
into the workplace.

00:38:48.406 --> 00:38:50.430 align:middle line:90%
It's taken a while to catch up.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Just in the last
10 years, as women

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.150 align:middle line:84%
are integrated
into the workplace,

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.210 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing gyms at
work, childcare at work,

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.804 align:middle line:84%
all these things that
are about well-being.

00:39:00.804 --> 00:39:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone's going
to agree with this,

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:06.830 align:middle line:84%
but in my opinion,
that suggestion

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:10.092 align:middle line:84%
that we take care of ourselves
well to get the job done,

00:39:10.092 --> 00:39:11.925 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that comes
from the masculine.

00:39:11.925 --> 00:39:12.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:39:12.755 --> 00:39:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: The masculine's
like, never mind the gym.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.046 align:middle line:90%
Let's just get the job done.

00:39:16.046 --> 00:39:17.200 align:middle line:90%
We'll just skip lunch.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.620 align:middle line:84%
We'll just push through
til midnight, you see.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] Exactly.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: It's the feminine,
not necessarily women,

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:24.004 align:middle line:84%
but the feminine
energy that realizes

00:39:24.004 --> 00:39:25.170 align:middle line:90%
the importance of nurturing.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
agree with that.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about men and
their defined purpose.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.165 align:middle line:84%
And we spoke about
this a little before.

00:39:32.165 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:84%
If men do not find
their purpose,

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.240 align:middle line:84%
it can be a very untethered
and confusing reality.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the overlay of making
an income or money, which

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:84%
as you say in your
book is almost always

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:84%
secondary to the
purpose if a man is

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.930 align:middle line:90%
really conscious and balanced.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, I think
it ideally should be.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.740 align:middle line:90%
It very rarely is like that.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:54.920 align:middle line:90%
It should be, yeah.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: But
ideally, a man finds

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.200 align:middle line:84%
his way of giving his
gift in the world.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.730 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.690 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the way
we're talking about it.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:09.610 align:middle line:84%
That's not so much about
choosing the right job.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to somebody
yesterday, a coaching client,

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and he said he went
to technical school

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and looked down the list to find
which is the one that's right

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.420 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.378 align:middle line:84%
And of course, none of
them felt right for him,

00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:25.140 align:middle line:84%
because your gift that
you were born to give,

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:31.894 align:middle line:84%
it's not like to be a
software engineer or a--

00:40:31.894 --> 00:40:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
necessarily career-related.

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:41.050 align:middle line:84%
A man's gift is
his sense of doing

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.432 align:middle line:84%
the right thing, a
sense of like, ah,

00:40:43.432 --> 00:40:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I came here to serve
in a particular way

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and to find the
expression of that,

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's just a matter
of being true to himself.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I actually was talking
to one of my clients

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.740 align:middle line:84%
yesterday, who said he
felt he had kind of lost

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.830 align:middle line:84%
his gift or his mission because
he was taking a lot of time

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.900 align:middle line:84%
now to look after
his father, who

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.060 align:middle line:84%
has Alzheimer's, and his mother,
who is struggling as well.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.790 align:middle line:90%
They're both in their 90s.

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So he felt, oh,
well, I've kind of

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.580 align:middle line:84%
abandoned by mission to really
be there for my parents.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, let me
ask you a question,

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:25.120 align:middle line:84%
because if you did not
take care of your parents,

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.590 align:middle line:84%
would you feel like
you were really

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:27.714 align:middle line:90%
being the man you could be?

00:41:27.714 --> 00:41:29.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, I'd
really regret it.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.349 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, so--
there's a phrase

00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:34.140 align:middle line:84%
we use in the book of
"do the right thing."

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.150 align:middle line:90%
We put that in capital letters.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.200 align:middle line:84%
"Do the right thing" is
a kind of a definition

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.170 align:middle line:90%
of a man on purpose.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:39.340 align:middle line:90%
He's doing the right thing.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So I said, do you feel that
looking after your parents

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:84%
at this point in your life
is doing the right thing?

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:44.483 align:middle line:90%
He said, absolutely.

00:41:44.483 --> 00:41:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, then looking after
your parents is your mission.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.550 align:middle line:90%
That is your purpose right now.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not exclusively
your purpose.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.691 align:middle line:84%
You've got other
work you do as well,

00:41:52.691 --> 00:41:55.620 align:middle line:84%
but it's part of living your
purpose and your mission.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I spent years as
a single father,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:84%
living just me and
my two boys together.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And I put tons of time into
cooking all of their food

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.200 align:middle line:90%
from original ingredients.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.825 align:middle line:84%
I didn't buy anything
out of a package.

00:42:09.825 --> 00:42:11.574 align:middle line:84%
I spent tons of time
going for bike rides,

00:42:11.574 --> 00:42:13.220 align:middle line:84%
showing up for every
basketball game.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I was completely
living my purpose.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't a course
from a university.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.992 align:middle line:84%
It was doing the thing
that I was born to do.

00:42:20.992 --> 00:42:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we mean
by mission and purpose.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And really, there isn't a
formula that you can apply.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.520 align:middle line:84%
You know that you're living
your purpose because it's

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:32.280 align:middle line:84%
effortless, it's easy, and
you go to bed at night feeling

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.380 align:middle line:90%
like, yes, I'm living on target.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm living on purpose.

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that I think

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:45.350 align:middle line:84%
coaching is incredibly helpful
for, to have a peer who's not

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.390 align:middle line:84%
meeting you, talking
down to you as a teacher,

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.980 align:middle line:84%
but meeting you as
a man on the level.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I know your challenges, brother,
and I can support you in this.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Having somebody who
can support you,

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.560 align:middle line:84%
intuitively feeling into
the right direction,

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and then slowly building on
that, incredibly helpful.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can usually
get a man back

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.660 align:middle line:90%
on track in one or two months.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the money equation,

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:13.040 align:middle line:84%
because so many men equate
their value with their income,

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and, A, what this
does, and also,

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.760 align:middle line:84%
some of the facts you put
in the book, which I thought

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.410 align:middle line:84%
were interesting, that if you're
on the lower socioeconomic end

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:84%
of the scale and you
have, say, a boost

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.980 align:middle line:84%
of $5,000, $10,000 a year
in your salary, that's

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:84%
a big boost and a feeling of
well-being, an accomplishment.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.689 align:middle line:84%
And then up to $100,000 a year
is-- I think that was the--

00:43:33.689 --> 00:43:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: That's where
the bell-curve levels off.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.646 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
it starts leveling off,

00:43:37.646 --> 00:43:40.650 align:middle line:84%
that your knees are
met at $100,000 a year.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:84%
By the time you get into the
range of $200,000 to $300,000

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:47.410 align:middle line:90%
a year--

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:48.368 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: It drops off.

00:43:48.368 --> 00:43:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It drops off,
satisfaction in life.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Everything starts dropping off.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Happiness drops off.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah, very
shocking statistic.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that research
was done by Martin Seligman

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:58.420 align:middle line:84%
at the center of a
positive psychology

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.930 align:middle line:84%
in I think it's Penn State or
University of Pennsylvania.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:01.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very interesting.

00:44:01.625 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So the sense of a
positive psychology,

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:07.690 align:middle line:84%
they've developed a 22-point
measurement of well-being.

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:12.600 align:middle line:84%
It includes proclivity
towards addiction,

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.470 align:middle line:84%
relationship with
children, how quickly you

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:20.740 align:middle line:84%
get divorced, all these things,
so 22 fairly good measurement

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.220 align:middle line:90%
of well-being, right?

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they found this thing
that if your income goes up

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.000 align:middle line:84%
from $25,000 to $30,000
a year, you will

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.366 align:middle line:90%
see an increase of well-being.

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:30.490 align:middle line:90%
It levels off, as you said.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:32.281 align:middle line:84%
It levels off for quite
a while where money

00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:33.490 align:middle line:90%
makes no difference anymore.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.560 align:middle line:84%
But then the shocking thing
is that very wealthy people,

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.330 align:middle line:84%
the more money they
make, on average the more

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:90%
their well-being goes down.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.320 align:middle line:84%
You've probably seen
this thing about people

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.914 align:middle line:90%
who win the lottery.

00:44:45.914 --> 00:44:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was actually
a class-action lawsuit

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:49.288 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago in
California where

00:44:49.288 --> 00:44:51.830 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of lottery winners
gathered together and tried

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:54.410 align:middle line:84%
to sue the government for
having won the lottery.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Because they said it
damaged their life so badly.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.680 align:middle line:90%
That was crazy.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.480 align:middle line:90%
But I understand.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: It damaged
their lives so badly,

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.950 align:middle line:84%
because actually
having loads of money

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.930 align:middle line:84%
is not real-- it's a
completely false goal.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't actually
give you anything.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
truly fool's gold.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.654 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: It's fool's gold.

00:45:11.654 --> 00:45:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a shocking idea.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:16.450 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
how we've been raised,

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.356 align:middle line:84%
you go to the
supermarket, what do you

00:45:18.356 --> 00:45:20.480 align:middle line:84%
see-- I mean, it's maybe
changing a little bit now,

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.188 align:middle line:84%
but what do you see
at the cash register?

00:45:22.188 --> 00:45:25.750 align:middle line:84%
All these pictures of
people who are "successful."

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And what does success mean?

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of money or a lot
of power or a lot of fame,

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.800 align:middle line:84%
none of which give
you any value at all.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.720 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of people
who have come out recently,

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.056 align:middle line:90%
people like Russell Brand--

00:45:36.056 --> 00:45:38.056 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to
get to that point next.

00:45:38.056 --> 00:45:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Sean Penn, Brad Pitt--
these are all people recently

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.760 align:middle line:84%
who have come out and said,
it was all a ladder pointing

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.630 align:middle line:90%
against the wrong wall.

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Fame and money and
power doesn't give you

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.750 align:middle line:90%
any nourishment at all.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And those three actors,
interestingly they've

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:59.450 align:middle line:84%
all turned their energy toward
social and political action

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:84%
as a result, making
a difference,

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:03.570 align:middle line:90%
contributing in a positive way.

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:07.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
and get into sexuality,

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:10.070 align:middle line:84%
because the whole notion
of the chemicals that

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:12.140 align:middle line:84%
are needed and
created, and we'll

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.530 align:middle line:84%
get toward the end of that
part of the conversation

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and what it takes to
bring polarity back

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.492 align:middle line:90%
in familiar circumstance.

00:46:18.492 --> 00:46:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Do you
think before we do

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.980 align:middle line:84%
that I could just put
one tiny footnote on that

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.820 align:middle line:90%
about the money thing?

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:23.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Because that
doesn't mean that we

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:25.780 align:middle line:90%
want to worship poverty.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.462 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to go into some
kind of pseudo-spiritual--

00:46:29.462 --> 00:46:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No,
because there's a lot

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.950 align:middle line:90%
of that, where you just wander.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll let spirit
tell me where to go next.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:34.950 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work well.

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: No, no.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:36.625 align:middle line:84%
Because you
mentioned your friend

00:46:36.625 --> 00:46:38.690 align:middle line:84%
you had dinner who was
not able to make a living.

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then
you're purposeless.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So the thing
is, when a man really

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:47.980 align:middle line:84%
gives his gift, when a man
really is fully on target

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.810 align:middle line:84%
with contributing
everything he can

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:53.540 align:middle line:84%
to give with his relationship,
with his children,

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.800 align:middle line:84%
but also with his
work, if you simply

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.340 align:middle line:84%
take care of your
beliefs around money

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and just wash yourself clean
of any prejudice around money

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and either way, I've
experienced that money

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:05.480 align:middle line:90%
takes care of itself.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.845 align:middle line:84%
People want to give you money
when you are making a real--

00:47:08.845 --> 00:47:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When
you're showing up.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.011 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: When you're
showing up and you're

00:47:12.011 --> 00:47:14.840 align:middle line:84%
making a real contribution,
people want to give you money.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.540 align:middle line:90%
My primary income is as a coach.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't get paid to
run my coaching school,

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:21.440 align:middle line:84%
because in order to
maintain quality,

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.990 align:middle line:90%
we just plow it all back in.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So I get paid by my
coaching clients.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.262 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
published fees, right?

00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:29.720 align:middle line:84%
People say, how
much do you charge?

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:30.594 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any fee.

00:47:30.594 --> 00:47:32.100 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to pay?

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed if
I just ask people,

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.380 align:middle line:84%
what do you want
to pay, we define

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.990 align:middle line:84%
what the service will be,
they come up with an amount

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.510 align:middle line:90%
that they choose.

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And now I've created
a context where

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.230 align:middle line:84%
people are deciding they want to
give me money to support them.

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:48.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's the ideal--

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's usually
honoring proportionate

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.092 align:middle line:90%
to what you bring to the table.

00:47:51.092 --> 00:47:51.891 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:47:51.891 --> 00:47:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So what I've learned
by doing that is

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.129 align:middle line:84%
I've learned the world
is full of people

00:47:56.129 --> 00:47:57.670 align:middle line:84%
who want to give me
money. [CHUCKLES]

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:59.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's a great belief.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about Russell Brand.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the notion,
like we're talking about,

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the kids now who
just don't want to get

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.620 align:middle line:84%
involved with these
scary girls who

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.840 align:middle line:84%
are out there doing
what they have to do,

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.960 align:middle line:84%
because they've come to
feel that they may not have

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.610 align:middle line:90%
any partnership any time soon.

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And the guys aren't
picking up their part,

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.950 align:middle line:84%
so now the girls
have become, maybe

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:25.240 align:middle line:84%
you could even say overly
masculinized, quite ambitious.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's more of a
trend with the younger

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:30.790 align:middle line:84%
girls, which is out
of need and necessity

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and also conditioning.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a new kind
of conditioning.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So now the boys
still, they're boys.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.340 align:middle line:84%
They still have some chemicals
running through their bodies.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's say what
happens when you

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:45.290 align:middle line:84%
go to either serial dating,
in other words, strangers,

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:46.090 align:middle line:90%
or porn.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Mm.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a very
different biochemistry

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:54.690 align:middle line:84%
happens with both
porn-- I mean, there's

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.850 align:middle line:90%
porn that you watch passively.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.555 align:middle line:84%
But now there's also
the kind of porn

00:48:58.555 --> 00:49:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that's interactive,
where you pay some money

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:02.535 align:middle line:90%
and you get to actually talk--

00:49:02.535 --> 00:49:04.849 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And virtual
reality's coming soon.

00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I don't
know about that.

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't heard about
that, but there

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.410 align:middle line:84%
is the porn where you
talk to somebody, right?

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:11.993 align:middle line:84%
And then there's,
as you said, there's

00:49:11.993 --> 00:49:15.140 align:middle line:90%
dating somebody that's new.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, newness, any
kind of new challenge,

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:27.920 align:middle line:84%
kicks in the dopamine,
peaks dopamine, as well as

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.890 align:middle line:90%
other brain chemicals.

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go into
the whole chemistry of it,

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.610 align:middle line:84%
partly because John is
the expert on that piece.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But it means that on a new date
or in a pornographic situation

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.690 align:middle line:84%
or with a prostitute,
it used to be,

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:47.320 align:middle line:84%
a man is going to get turned
on and excited and aroused

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.630 align:middle line:90%
because of the newness, right?

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how it used to
work for thousands of years.

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.880 align:middle line:84%
That was the main
way it would work.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:00.960 align:middle line:84%
A man would get excited
by getting married.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:01.900 align:middle line:90%
He sets a goal.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make her my wife.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.230 align:middle line:84%
He gets the rose, he's
got everything ready.

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Once he's got her
pregnant, the excitement

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:09.779 align:middle line:90%
goes out very quickly.

00:50:09.779 --> 00:50:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
way it used to work.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.766 align:middle line:84%
Then he would start to have
affairs or go to prostitutes.

00:50:13.766 --> 00:50:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And he would lose
interest in his wife.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.560 align:middle line:90%
That was quite common.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.050 align:middle line:90%
It was to be expected.

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, in the last
probably 30, 40 years,

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.340 align:middle line:84%
we've seen something new,
which is men actually having

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:29.950 align:middle line:84%
a priority of wanting to
make relationship work well,

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:34.060 align:middle line:84%
wanting to have-- men are now
choosing monogamy as a value

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.650 align:middle line:90%
rather than as a moral precept.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:38.230 align:middle line:84%
They're not monogamous because
their church tells them to be.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:40.313 align:middle line:84%
They're monogamous because
they set that as a goal

00:50:40.313 --> 00:50:41.160 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But now there's the challenge
of the biochemistry.

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Because if a man goes
to bed with his wife,

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.400 align:middle line:84%
she needs to talk for a while
to get the oxytocin going

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.100 align:middle line:84%
so that she actually
starts to feel

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:84%
aroused and is ready to
welcome him into her body.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the problem.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:02.470 align:middle line:84%
If a man spends that time
talking about feelings together

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and sharing, by the
time she's aroused,

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:07.240 align:middle line:90%
he's also released oxytocin.

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.040 align:middle line:90%
He's gone limp.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All his
chemicals are gone.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: And he
can't get a hard-on.

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And then he starts to
ask, what's wrong with me?

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:13.541 align:middle line:90%
This is my wife.

00:51:13.541 --> 00:51:14.340 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I should be
getting-- oh, my God.

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:16.700 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe he has
a secret affair,

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:22.419 align:middle line:84%
or that accounts for the huge
sale of Viagra and Kialis--

00:51:22.419 --> 00:51:23.460 align:middle line:90%
is that what it's called?

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cialis or something.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:24.998 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Cialis, yeah.

00:51:24.998 --> 00:51:27.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, so he turns to
chemicals, right?

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
solution, which

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:31.548 align:middle line:84%
I think is a preferable-- I'm
going to get sued by the drug

00:51:31.548 --> 00:51:34.830 align:middle line:84%
companies, but I think it's
preferable to the chemicals,

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:38.950 align:middle line:84%
which is if a man can
find a way-- you see,

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:43.362 align:middle line:84%
a man gets aroused by having
a challenge to perform, OK?

00:51:43.362 --> 00:51:45.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get a
little graphic here,

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:45.540 align:middle line:90%
if you don't mind.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
graphic is OK.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It's little kind of a PG
network, but go ahead.

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:50.088 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: OK, OK, yeah.

00:51:50.088 --> 00:51:53.265 align:middle line:84%
But we can't talk about sex
without a little bit of telling

00:51:53.265 --> 00:51:54.140 align:middle line:90%
it like it is, right?

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So he needs to
have some kind of challenge.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:59.650 align:middle line:84%
The challenge that
he can bring in

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:05.470 align:middle line:84%
is to make sex with his
partner about her pleasure

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:08.732 align:middle line:84%
and about bringing her to
a peak of satisfaction.

00:52:08.732 --> 00:52:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
can be challenging.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Which can
be challenging, right?

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'll kind of
edit this is to make

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:18.980 align:middle line:84%
it suitable for your
audience, but there

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:23.800 align:middle line:84%
are ways he can do that, which
actually will challenge him,

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.440 align:middle line:84%
which will introduce
this element of,

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.020 align:middle line:90%
am I going to make it or not?

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:30.420 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you bring
that element back in,

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that will restore the
element of testosterone.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And if he's successful-- this
is what we call in the book

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:42.220 align:middle line:84%
it polarity sex, and it's
very graphic in the book.

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:45.076 align:middle line:84%
If a man can be successful in
bringing a woman to orgasm,

00:52:45.076 --> 00:52:47.450 align:middle line:84%
he's going to have that feeling
of checking something off

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:48.215 align:middle line:90%
on a box psychologically.

00:52:48.215 --> 00:52:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Boo-- all the
chemicals are there.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Like, I did it!

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm the guy!

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.340 align:middle line:90%
I took her to the moon, right?

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:56.870 align:middle line:84%
That means the next day or two
days later or three days later,

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:59.330 align:middle line:84%
the next time there's
the possibility

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:01.600 align:middle line:84%
of sexual interaction,
he's going

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to walk into the situation
feeling already, I'm the guy,

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.380 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.049 align:middle line:84%
He's going to then
have an even more

00:53:08.049 --> 00:53:09.840 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling sexual
experience with his wife,

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to
build his confidence

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.440 align:middle line:90%
and also increase her openness.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's the formula,
is polarity sex,

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:19.440 align:middle line:84%
which is structured sex where
at least at the beginning,

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.960 align:middle line:84%
there's three phases to
it described in the book.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:25.250 align:middle line:84%
The first phase
focuses on getting

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:27.330 align:middle line:84%
him warmed up,
because he needs kind

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:28.780 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of jump start.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But the main phase, the
central phase of polarity sex,

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is that he focus on
her pleasure, probably

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.100 align:middle line:90%
without penetration, right?

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So he's actually
bringing her to orgasm.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And then only in
the third phase do

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.310 align:middle line:84%
they have what we normally think
of as penetrating sex, right?

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But this is after
she's had an orgasm.

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So now he can really give
to her through his body,

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.040 align:middle line:84%
but after she's
already peaked, right?

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Now that formula will restore
the chemistry necessary

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.140 align:middle line:90%
for him to feel successful.

00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And a man who practices in
this way-- we've tested this

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:07.040 align:middle line:84%
out-- he actually, if he does
go back to porn or other women,

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.610 align:middle line:84%
he just loses interest,
because somehow the chemistry

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:12.162 align:middle line:84%
is restored and he feels
good about himself.

00:54:12.162 --> 00:54:13.120 align:middle line:90%
He actually starts to--

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's not looking
for a quick jump in dopamine

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:15.680 align:middle line:90%
and testosterone, serotonin.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.417 align:middle line:84%
He looks forward to
intimacy with his wife,

00:54:19.417 --> 00:54:20.750 align:middle line:90%
because he knows, I can do this.

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:21.750 align:middle line:90%
The main reason--

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
accomplishment.

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:26.292 align:middle line:84%
The main reason I would say
that a man looks outside

00:54:26.292 --> 00:54:28.750 align:middle line:84%
of the relationship, whether
he's in a relationship or not,

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:30.600 align:middle line:84%
the main reason a
man looks outside

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.020 align:middle line:84%
is because he's lost confidence
that he can bring a woman

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.430 align:middle line:90%
to peaks of fulfillment.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was very well
laid-out out, and as you say,

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:45.150 align:middle line:84%
it's graphic, but I
mean, it's natural.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about that,
and I thought, that actually

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.210 align:middle line:90%
makes perfect sense.

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:53.670 align:middle line:84%
If a man is wired
toward accomplishment,

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:55.529 align:middle line:84%
even in sexuality there
has to be-- I mean,

00:54:55.529 --> 00:54:56.945 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know
someone, if it's

00:54:56.945 --> 00:55:00.630 align:middle line:84%
a stranger or whatever, it's
just a quick win, dominance

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:01.780 align:middle line:90%
and then you're done.

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But in a day in, day
out loving relationship,

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:07.120 align:middle line:84%
it's been a problem
throughout history.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The polarization is gone,
and that makes perfect sense

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:10.990 align:middle line:90%
in re-establishing it.

00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Exactly.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to throw in
a little point here.

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:14.129 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:55:14.129 --> 00:55:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Because you actually
humorously use the idea of PG.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we're not
in a cinema, but still,

00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:24.690 align:middle line:84%
an interesting thing, that when
we have these ratings of PG

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and whatever, R and everything,
we apply it to sex, but not

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:28.910 align:middle line:90%
to violence.

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I know.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It's just ridiculous.

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:31.603 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: It's that interesting?

00:55:31.603 --> 00:55:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So actually, if we were to have
a conversation now about AK-47s

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and semiautomatic weapons, we
could say anything we want,

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:40.179 align:middle line:90%
although though things--

00:55:40.179 --> 00:55:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: About war
and people losing

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.920 align:middle line:90%
their legs and their limbs.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Those things actually
caused tremendous harm, right?

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:47.990 align:middle line:84%
If we were to have a
conversation about sex

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:52.510 align:middle line:84%
between mice, I could talk
about a female mice's clitoris,

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and I could talk freely about
sex between other mammals,

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.850 align:middle line:90%
and we'd be OK with it.

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But we've put this
kind of taboo boundary.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:04.690 align:middle line:84%
We can't discuss sexuality
between human beings.

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:06.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of censored.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, excuse me?

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.017 align:middle line:84%
What is the logic
in that? [LAUGHING]

00:56:11.017 --> 00:56:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's quite American.

00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I notice in other countries they
don't have the same challenges.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, I think it's
really worth questioning.

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Because why would we
want to censor something

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:24.900 align:middle line:84%
which is the gateway to feeling
fantastic, to greater love?

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes just having
great sex on its own

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:28.790 align:middle line:84%
will solve a lot of
marital conflict.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Why would we want
to censor that,

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:32.500 align:middle line:84%
which is like one of
the best things around,

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.920 align:middle line:90%
and not censor violence?

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand it.

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's an
important point we raise,

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:39.738 align:middle line:84%
because although I'm happy
to cooperate with whatever

00:56:39.738 --> 00:56:41.800 align:middle line:84%
the limits are in
a conversation,

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.530 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we don't want to
talk about these things I think

00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:46.310 align:middle line:84%
actually is responsible
for the fact

00:56:46.310 --> 00:56:48.545 align:middle line:84%
that many men don't know
how to make all this work.

00:56:48.545 --> 00:56:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:49.980 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:51.173 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Because we can't
talk about it, you see.

00:56:51.173 --> 00:56:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.081 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: I think it's
something we should really

00:56:54.081 --> 00:56:56.350 align:middle line:84%
find ways to talk about
as much as possible that's

00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:58.130 align:middle line:90%
why we wrote about in the book.

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:01.090 align:middle line:84%
If a man can understand,
this is not so difficult.

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I've just got to do this and
then do this and then touch

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.920 align:middle line:84%
this and then lick that, and
then it's going to be OK.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.700 align:middle line:84%
If a man can simply understand
that, problem solved.

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.700 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that we don't
want to talk about it

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:12.380 align:middle line:84%
is actually exacerbating
the problem.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you, yeah.

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a very repressed society
in that way and yet pervasive.

00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:22.690 align:middle line:84%
It's pervasive in a really
more unhealthy manner,

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:25.070 align:middle line:84%
not in a real manner
between people,

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:27.850 align:middle line:84%
between adults, between
people that love each other.

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:31.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what's underrepresented,
is sexuality among

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:35.310 align:middle line:84%
people, husbands,
wives, so forth.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:36.216 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Well, yeah.

00:57:36.216 --> 00:57:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a whole
conversation we could have.

00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
another conversation.

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:41.400 align:middle line:84%
One final point
before we wrap it up,

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and that has to do with the
expression of anger in men.

00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:47.580 align:middle line:84%
See, you don't have to be-- you
don't need a PG rating there.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.267 align:middle line:84%
You can talk about anger all you
want, violence, like you said.

00:57:50.267 --> 00:57:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: [LAUGHING] Yeah.

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:53.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But anger in
men-- when all of this

00:57:53.225 --> 00:57:56.470 align:middle line:84%
comes to a head, so
to speak, and men have

00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:58.070 align:middle line:90%
been taught now to suppress it.

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:01.640 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to war, you're
not going to bludgeon someone.

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:05.660 align:middle line:84%
How do women best
interface with men

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:07.270 align:middle line:84%
when there is an
anger situation?

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Because women feel quite
threatened or smaller.

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.890 align:middle line:90%
So you feel threatened.

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So you're
asking how can a woman--

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's going
on with the men in terms

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of where is their responsibility
within this in a conscious way?

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
best way for women

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.900 align:middle line:90%
to interface with that anger?

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Right.

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think the first
thing to understand

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.810 align:middle line:84%
is that anger, or
violence anyway,

00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:35.290 align:middle line:84%
is the expression of an
energy gone out of control.

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Anger, as we understand it,
is feeling the energy, right?

00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it's verbal
or physical violence,

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:48.180 align:middle line:90%
that is usually destructive.

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But the energy itself,
if we reel it back,

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.550 align:middle line:84%
the energy itself is actually
a good thing for a man to have.

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:58.400 align:middle line:84%
A man who's lost that,
[SLAPPING] [GRUNTING], feeling,

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.075 align:middle line:84%
he's actually going to become
a weak man who can't accomplish

00:59:01.075 --> 00:59:01.950 align:middle line:90%
anything in his life.

00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:04.670 align:middle line:84%
He needs that feeling
of, [GRUNTING], right?

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:07.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
knowing how to channel it.

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:08.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's also--

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:10.081 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you
say, it's pure energy.

00:59:10.081 --> 00:59:11.107 align:middle line:90%
It's raw food.

00:59:11.107 --> 00:59:13.065 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, that's
to do with testosterone.

00:59:13.065 --> 00:59:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Because testosterone
is a hormone

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that perceives boundaries
and just pushes through them.

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:20.450 align:middle line:90%
It's like American football.

00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:21.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a big testosterone sport.

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like push through
and get the goal.

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's very much about how
the masculine psyche is wired.

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And when a man is
successful at doing that,

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:32.420 align:middle line:90%
he feels triumphant.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.110 align:middle line:84%
His teammates lift him up and
carry him around the field,

00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and he's ready to do
it again, you see.

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's something
we don't want to lose.

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Because a man who loses
it will lose his edge,

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:43.086 align:middle line:84%
and he'll feel
overwhelmed by life.

00:59:43.086 --> 00:59:44.336 align:middle line:90%
He'll feel much more stressed.

00:59:44.336 --> 00:59:44.732 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Defeated.

00:59:44.732 --> 00:59:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:49.244 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: So what's important
is-- but at the same time,

00:59:49.244 --> 00:59:50.910 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to be
punching people out.

00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:52.576 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
behave inappropriately.

00:59:52.576 --> 00:59:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And above all, we
don't want a man

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.260 align:middle line:84%
being violent or abusive or
threatening with his partner.

00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.330 align:middle line:84%
That's very destructive
to relationship.

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And a woman obviously
doesn't want that, either.

01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So the key here is for a man,
or, actually, in a couple,

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.530 align:middle line:84%
for a man and a woman to
learn the necessity for him

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.290 align:middle line:90%
to withdraw.

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:15.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole key.

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:18.104 align:middle line:84%
So a man basically needs to
learn a very simple thing.

01:00:18.104 --> 01:00:19.520 align:middle line:84%
We put it right
there in the book.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.895 align:middle line:84%
We've actually
put it in italics,

01:00:20.895 --> 01:00:22.370 align:middle line:90%
like here's what to say.

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:25.030 align:middle line:84%
When you feel that you're
kind of about to lose it,

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and most men do
feel that sometimes,

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:32.220 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to say, OK,
I've heard what you've said,

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and I really need
to think it over.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to go so much
in, oh, I'm feeling really upset

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.040 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.296 align:middle line:90%
Because that's not necessary.

01:00:39.296 --> 01:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just, I've heard
what you've said,

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.540 align:middle line:90%
I need some time to digest.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.910 align:middle line:90%
And then withdraw.

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
our cue to just, OK--

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Well, that's
the other piece, you see.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So for a man, he's going
to learn to say that,

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and he's got to learn to say it
in a way that feel supportive.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So he doesn't want
to say, like, I've

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:57.730 align:middle line:90%
had enough of this nonsense.

01:00:57.730 --> 01:00:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.446 align:middle line:90%
That's not supportive.

01:00:59.446 --> 01:01:02.420 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to say, OK,
you've made some good points,

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and I really need some time
to withdraw and digest.

01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:08.760 align:middle line:84%
That's a positive,
supportive thing to say.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But what a woman needs to
learn is when he's stirred up,

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.320 align:middle line:84%
it's not the time
to chase after him.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Because what a woman
thinks is, well, we

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.200 align:middle line:84%
need to talk this through,
like don't bottle it up.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Talk it through.

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
That's not how he
works, you see.

01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:27.570 align:middle line:84%
When a man's stirred
up, he's getting

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:29.460 align:middle line:90%
into this testosterone thing.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
If she doesn't allow
him to take space, which

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
is quite a common pattern
between men and women,

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
he's eventually
going to explode.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.700 align:middle line:10%
So when he says, I need
to think this over,

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.580 align:middle line:10%
or, I need some
time to withdraw,

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.900 align:middle line:10%
for a woman, what she can
do is to honor that space

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.130 align:middle line:10%
but then measure it.

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:49.340 align:middle line:10%
If he comes back within
24 hours with a solution,

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.412 align:middle line:10%
then it was successful.

01:01:50.412 --> 01:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
If he says, I'm going to go
away and think about this

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.828 align:middle line:84%
and just never mentions it
again and obviously didn't

01:01:54.828 --> 01:01:56.900 align:middle line:84%
deal with it, then they
may need some support.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing
today is we really

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.490 align:middle line:84%
understand the benefit of
coaching and counseling

01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:03.830 align:middle line:90%
and marital counseling.

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we can get
help with these things

01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:08.884 align:middle line:84%
from people who understand
how to do them effectively.

01:02:08.884 --> 01:02:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're out of time.

01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But the other final part on that
is when the guy does go away,

01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
a man goes away and processes it
and comes back, the women, you

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
warn, should not punish
them for that withdrawal.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ARDAGH: Right.

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank him.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank him.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: Thank him for having
been responsible and used

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.870 align:middle line:90%
his energy in a responsible way.

01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:middle line:90%
All very good advice.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.890 align:middle line:90%
You did an excellent job.

01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
As you say, there's a his
part, a her part, and so forth,

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:34.850 align:middle line:90%
everything in between.

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ARDAGH: The book
is for men and women

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:41.070 align:middle line:84%
to understand the masculine
psyche and biology better

01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to bring
out the best in a man.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to look
any particular way.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
The important thing is that
he feels good about himself.

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Again, thank you so much.

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:54.240 align:middle line:10%
The name of the book is
"Conscious Men," which you

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.850 align:middle line:10%
can find at major booksellers.

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.950 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here on Gaia.
