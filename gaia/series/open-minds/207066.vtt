00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY CARSON: People don't
really believe or understand

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.652 align:middle line:84%
the power that they're using
the manifest on a daily basis.

00:00:13.652 --> 00:00:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So you have to start thinking
positive about finance.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Stop being afraid of it.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.783 align:middle line:84%
Fear is a low vibration,
low frequency.

00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:20.450 align:middle line:10%
When somebody says
raise your vibration,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:10%
raise your frequency,
it's a real statement.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a real scientific
statement that

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.177 align:middle line:84%
can be measured on
a computer screen.

00:00:26.177 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you take your
mind from the thought

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
of hoping and begging
to commanding,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:90%
the brainwaves flip.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And the frequency goes higher,
and the wavelengths get closer.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, every
thought that you're thinking

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:90%
goes out into spacetime.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:10%
And so all those thoughts
are floating around in space

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:10%
with data on them.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
That data is picked up from
the universal consciousness,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and then it swings
back around to you,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:84%
all the things that you need
to make those thoughts happen.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.717 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.717 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of our
audience's favorite guests

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:10%
is Billy Carson,
with whom I've had

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:10%
previous wonderful,
enlightening conversations.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:10%
Billy is back with
me today to talk

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:10%
about raising our frequencies
and dovetailing that

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:10%
into prosperity.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, we just
changed the open to the show

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:84%
this very minute, because
you say, hey, Regina,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:90%
I have a book for you.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
I do my homework.

00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I had a whole script done here.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.122 align:middle line:84%
Well, you brought "Woke
Doesn't Mean Broke."

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's right.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I thought,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.615 align:middle line:90%
whoa, what's this all about?

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:90%
And you started telling me.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I made an executive
decision on the spot.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.128 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about light, and we're

00:01:30.128 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
how light is used

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
to manifest in how we raise
our frequencies through light.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And we can get into that
incredibly esoteric discussion

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:84%
a little later on
if we have time.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.318 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:01:40.318 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
people really need

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.027 align:middle line:84%
is, how do I make this work
in this world right now.

00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:45.407 align:middle line:90%
We've had such a tough time.

00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK with you?

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I agree.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:90%
I love the executive decision.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.442 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so happy you chose that.

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, me too.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.567 align:middle line:84%
Now, mind you, I don't know
anything that's in here.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I just saw the book
a few minutes ago.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.972 align:middle line:84%
We've only talked
for a minute or so.

00:01:56.972 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to pretend,
like I do all the time

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:90%
with someone on an airplane.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
sitting next to me,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to say, whoa,
that sounds intriguing.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:90%
What's this about?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:90%
And we'll start.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of all, in
a nutshell, what's this about

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.373 align:middle line:84%
and why did you
decide to write it?

00:02:10.373 --> 00:02:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get
into the book itself.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
the book itself is

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.877 align:middle line:84%
about how to combine
spirituality and spiritual

00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
practices with understanding
how to navigate

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:90%
this financial matrix.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:10%
I think often people
say that people

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:10%
who are spiritual shouldn't
have financial abundance,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't be wealthy.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:10%
They're supposed to be poor
in some kind of weird way.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
They really believe that people
who are chasing spirituality

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't have anything.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the opposite.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.817 align:middle line:84%
If you're walking around talking
about, you are the light,

00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
the power is in you, we
can manifest our reality,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.207 align:middle line:84%
and you can't pay
a light bill, I

00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
don't think people are
going to believe you.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I think abundance
means something different

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:90%
for everyone.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's OK, but you should
walk in abundance 24/7.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you need to understand
the financial backing

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
behind and the instructions
and information

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
on how to actually achieve that.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to combine
the two together.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.643 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that's
really needed right now,

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
because we're in a world
where a lot of things

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
are happening coming out of
the great shutdown, right?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have people who
were doing service industry

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:84%
jobs and subsistence level
jobs that are saying,

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I had a break from it,
it killed my spirit.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:90%
You know, they're in despair.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what to do.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that
is one level that,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you address
this level of people who

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:84%
are in service industry jobs
that don't want to go back

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to them anymore, because
the pay's no good,

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
the hours are long, and
they feel more or less

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:90%
abused in a lot of cases.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's start there at
that level of employment.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And how do you address
people in this situation?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Most people
in those situations

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
are some of the most
incredible people

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
on the planet in terms
of their creativity,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:90%
the way that they think.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Their memories are
phenomenal, especially

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
in the service-- their memories
are incredible at service.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I go to restaurants,
a year later, people go, oh,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
you want this, this,
this, and this.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what in the world?

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And so these people
have specific passions.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I would tell them, the
key is to find your passion.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Get a piece of paper out, get
a pen out-- old-fashioned pen

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:90%
and paper.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Start writing down the
things that you like to do,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a hobby,
something you're

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:84%
passionate about, something
you always wanted to do.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And fill that paper
with all these ideas.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
And then start choosing
which passions you kind

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:90%
of gravitate towards the most.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:10%
And then once you do that, start
researching and investigating

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:10%
what industries need this
passion, what people,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:10%
what companies need this
passion that you have--

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:10%
something you have--

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:10%
who can use it.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Because the key to making money
is to find a need and fill it.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to do that,
but within your passion,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:84%
so that when you find
a need for your passion

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and you provide that need,
that energy exchange-- well,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.900 align:middle line:84%
the side effect is money
in your bank account.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.608 align:middle line:84%
And now you're doing
what you love to do,

00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
paid to do it.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
You'll never feel like you
worked a day in your life.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that is very true.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.622 align:middle line:90%
And that's how you live, right?

00:04:54.622 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm lucky to
live that way too.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Most people haven't had a chance
to really move into that zone

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
yet, because it's not
talked about or really

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:84%
encouraged in society
at this point in time.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:10%
So there's another-- let's
go in two nuances on that.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:10%
First of all, so
you have a person

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:10%
that, maybe they're a little
bit more pragmatic by nature

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:10%
and may not have
identified a passion,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:10%
but they've identified a skill
that they know they're good at

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:10%
and they don't mind doing.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.828 align:middle line:90%
So the same would apply?

00:05:22.828 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, the
same would apply.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Now, you can
start off working that skill

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:90%
with another company.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You have to start
off some sort of--

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:90%
You have to pay your dues.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:90%
You always have to pay.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.602 align:middle line:84%
But while you're
working that, you're

00:05:32.602 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:84%
learning all the aspects
of how the business runs.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:90%
You're doing your research.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:90%
You're learning.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, on the side you may
start doing your own thing.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you're
trying to steal business

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:90%
from that company.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.165 align:middle line:84%
But eventually your main
goal, your main plan

00:05:43.165 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
be your own boss.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.518 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you've
got to pay your dues.

00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even have a chance to
branch off from that company,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:90%
maybe start a franchise.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But while you're
doing these things,

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:84%
you have to be able to spend
your money in the right way,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:84%
live within your means,
live within your budget,

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:90%
make the right investments.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Don't keep blowing money
on partying and hanging out

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.588 align:middle line:90%
and things that have no value.

00:06:02.588 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
At some point, you've got
to say, look, I partied

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:90%
the majority of my early years.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I've got to sit down
and grind right now.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.727 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:09.727 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: In my early
years, I was grinding.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm at the point, if I want
to, I can sit back and relax.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.862 align:middle line:90%
I flipped it.

00:06:15.862 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So I
mean, you're talking

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.408 align:middle line:10%
about a certain level of
consciousness, obviously,

00:06:19.408 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:10%
that needs to be
there to begin with.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a woman recently
who runs an employment

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:90%
service for day workers.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.895 align:middle line:84%
And she said, same
thing every year.

00:06:27.895 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:84%
In this strata, you're
probably not going

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:90%
to get the message through.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:10%
She said, I've done
this for many years.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Every time there's a
tax season, there's

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of money that comes
back, we can't find workers.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Right now, that's kind
of what's happening

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
in America, because no one
wants to go back to those jobs.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
You're talking
unskilled labor jobs.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.292 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to that, I
mean, how do you address it?

00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I tell people,
listen-- well, first of all,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:90%
we have to realize one thing.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
You can lead a horse
to water, but you

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
can't make him drink
because you're thirsty.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I have add a little
extra peace to it.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And so somebody has to
become thirsty for themselves

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's the key.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's just like being
addicted to any kind of a drug

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.000 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.792 align:middle line:84%
If you don't admit that
you have a problem,

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:08.738 align:middle line:84%
you'll never be able
to get healed or cured.

00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the first
thing is, the person

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.880 align:middle line:90%
has to be real with themselves.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I have a problem with
handling and managing money.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:90%
It's been generational.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Through all the generations up
until me, it's been like that.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Or at least within some
time period, the way

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that I started managing
money, it's been horrible.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I have to admit--
that person has

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.805 align:middle line:84%
to admit that they've
got a problem with that

00:07:25.805 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and be wanting to-- be
willing to want to learn.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And especially if
they have a family

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
or if they started a family,
they've got to realize,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.047 align:middle line:84%
wow, I'm just burning
through everything

00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:36.338 align:middle line:90%
and turning through everything.

00:07:36.338 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not leaving
anything for my kids.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I'm not leaving
anything for the future.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, you can't
take it with you.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But you can set up
future generations

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:84%
who are still going
to be here to have

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:84%
a chance, an opportunity
to maneuver and do

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:90%
something in this world.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go
off on a sidetrack,

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:90%
a tangential for a minute.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is big for
you, personally.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And this is
something, before we

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.617 align:middle line:10%
get in, I'm just going
to kind of flip through

00:08:00.617 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:10%
randomly and say, OK,
what about this one here?

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
You personally are
getting together

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.358 align:middle line:84%
with your family in the
not too distant future.

00:08:10.358 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have a
party and do a will reading.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, you're young man.

00:08:14.283 --> 00:08:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So some people would say,
wow, you got it together.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:90%
You're doing this so young.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.170 align:middle line:10%
But it's far more than that.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And you shared something
with me off camera

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't aware of.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And you said, this
is not something

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
that's done in the
African-American community

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's right,
in general, not done.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's like, what?

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about this,
why you're doing this

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and what goes on
there that it spooks

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
a person from doing that?

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, again,
everybody's heard my story.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.929 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in the ghetto.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.178 align:middle line:84%
And talking about life
insurance policies--

00:08:46.178 --> 00:08:47.970 align:middle line:84%
nobody had money for
life insurance policy,

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
unless they had a really
good city job or something

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.217 align:middle line:84%
but they gave them a term
policy that was kind of included

00:08:52.217 --> 00:08:53.242 align:middle line:90%
for accidental death.

00:08:53.242 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Nobody really invested
in those kind of things.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And talking about dying
or talking about a

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:90%
will never happened.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And so quite often
what you would

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
see, over all these decades
that I've been alive now,

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I've seen so many GoFundMe
accounts, so many donations,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.313 align:middle line:84%
or before GoFundMe, selling
t-shirts on the corner,

00:09:09.313 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:84%
selling hot plates
of food at the church

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
to try to raise money
to buy a $5,000 casket.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.555 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm saying to myself,
when is this going to end?

00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I've got to be
the one to end it.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Even in my own family, when
my mom and dad passed away,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:90%
nothing, zero.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And why is there
fear of talking about death

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:10%
and what comes after you?

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: It's so weird.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:90%
It's so bizarre.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed like some
type of a weird taboo

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:84%
where everyone-- nobody
wants to talk about it.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it
like it jinxes you

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:90%
if you talk about your death?

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I believe
that's what they think.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:90%
It's like it feels like a jinx.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.265 align:middle line:84%
It means I'm going to die now,
all of a sudden, if I say,

00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:90%
if I talk about it.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.167 align:middle line:84%
There's one thing about talking
about something figuratively

00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and just talking about it
in general saying, look,

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:90%
if this happens.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing about
saying, I'm going to die.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Those are two different things.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But they
take it as the other

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, I'm going to die soon.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we
need to talk about.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And people were, I don't
want to talk about it.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
wrong with you?

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.562 align:middle line:84%
Even my own kids,
I said, we're going

00:10:00.562 --> 00:10:02.820 align:middle line:84%
to have this meeting about
my will and testament.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they know
what they're gathering?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They didn't like it?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They didn't like it.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.857 align:middle line:90%
Why are we doing this?

00:10:06.857 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, because
somebody needs to do it.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to start here.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.672 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to break this
generational curse.

00:10:11.672 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:84%
To now, we're going
to fix this problem.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.028 align:middle line:84%
And if something happens to
me, you guys are going to know.

00:10:16.028 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And I want to record
it on audio and video,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:90%
so that nobody's fighting.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
happens too, people

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.710 align:middle line:90%
who are left some things--

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this too many times--

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:90%
bickering, fighting, lawsuits.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: He said this.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:90%
She said that.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.822 align:middle line:90%
No, they didn't say that.

00:10:28.822 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
No, you're not
supposed to get this.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.948 align:middle line:84%
When my mom passed away,
people came to my mom's house

00:10:32.948 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and started clearing out
things out of the house.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have a
chance to go there myself.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I didn't
even get there yet.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Things are getting
taken out of the house.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I've seen that in
films like on islands in Greece

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:10%
where someone dies, and all the
women come in and just start

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:10%
scavenging.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened, literally.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wow.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Are you serious?

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:90%
So I said, this can't happen.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you, Billy.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And I hope the message makes
it out to a wider audience.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, you're
reaching a lot of people now.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.128 align:middle line:84%
But it's just
something again that I

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have ever known about.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: There's something
intricate here too.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not just my
will and my testament

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and this is what's
going to happen

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.512 align:middle line:84%
with my businesses and my
percentage of companies

00:11:08.512 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:90%
that I own.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
It's also spelled
out there specifics

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.080 align:middle line:84%
as to what you need to--
what you're required to do

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:90%
to acquire any of this money.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:84%
You're not just
going to get money.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Your credit score has
to be a certain number.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
gainfully employed

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:90%
or in your own business.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're not, then you
have to go get a job

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.520 align:middle line:84%
or start a business and be
in it for at least one year.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.165 align:middle line:84%
If you're like my grandkids,
it's going into a trust.

00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:32.540 align:middle line:84%
When they turn
18, they get some.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
When they turn 25,
they get some more.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.773 align:middle line:84%
When they turn 30,
they get some more.

00:11:35.773 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:84%
You can't give somebody
all that money at 18.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: There's the
requirements in there.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:84%
You're not just
going to walk in.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thank you for the money.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.262 align:middle line:90%
And go you know screw it up.

00:11:44.262 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And you have to come to
my financial workshops,

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
just in family, and understand
how to manage and use and run

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.820 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't attend
them, then you get nothing.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's so amazing about
you is, well, a lot of things.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:10%
But you're so highly
developed in this area now.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
partly how you out there.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.990 align:middle line:10%
And also the fact
that you're so highly

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:10%
developed in the world of
esoterica and understanding

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:10%
the underlying
matrices and principles

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:13.370 align:middle line:10%
behind how manifestation,
how life, how reality itself

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.300 align:middle line:10%
functions and essentially
how everything

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:10%
manifests into our reality,
this third-dimensional reality.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.805 align:middle line:84%
We're totally stupid
if we think that we

00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
can live in a
third-dimensional reality

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and not know anything
about how to make a living.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Doesn't work.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Doesn't work.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Like, what are we doing here?

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.618 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And speaking
of, OK, so I just told you

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go randomly.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:90%
So I opened the page to this.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
You can give us a
setup before this.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
your Billy Club plan.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:90%
It says control the matrix.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:90%
You have to play in this matrix.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's start there.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, we have
to first understand

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:84%
like admitting that you're an
addict or something like that

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:84%
or a poor money manager,
you have to admit it.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to admit
that we're in a matrix.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't want
to admit that we're

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:90%
in different levels of matrices.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.493 align:middle line:90%
We have the financial matrix.

00:12:55.493 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:90%
We have the esoteric matrix.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:90%
We have the holographic matrix.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:90%
There's different ones.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
The financial matrix,
everybody can relate to that.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a system that's
been set up globally

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:84%
that keeps us working and paying
and paying taxes and churning

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and churning and churning,
right, until we die.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to
admit that it's real.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't want
to admit it's real.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a real thing.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.095 align:middle line:84%
And you have to know
how to play in it.

00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So you have to understand
that there's a system here.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.605 align:middle line:84%
But just like Neo in
"The Matrix" movie,

00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
he was able to maneuver through
that system understanding

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.630 align:middle line:84%
the inner workings
of the matrix.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
He was able to make
it bend to his will.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're just going to
play by the exact rules that

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.792 align:middle line:84%
have been set forth
and you're not

00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
going to figure out all
the different loopholes

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.850 align:middle line:84%
that they've actually
provided you,

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to actually
fall prey or fall victim

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.513 align:middle line:90%
to suffering in this matrix.

00:13:42.513 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But there's a way to
play in this matrix

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:90%
to make it work for you.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:84%
You just have to understand
the inner workings of it

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.645 align:middle line:84%
and what things
you can and can't

00:13:48.645 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:84%
do to make it work
to your benefit.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, 800
and some pages, yeah?

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: 688.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 688 pages.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:90%
All right, you got that.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, for you,
personally, now, you

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:84%
started figuring this
out pretty young.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You were incredibly
creative and flexible

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:10%
the way your mind worked.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
You were resourceful
out of necessity.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
You wanted more than your
life was going to give you.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
started figuring things out.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:10%
However, you then wanted
to up the game even more.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And you told me, off camera,
that you have meetings

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.822 align:middle line:90%
with a man named Billy.

00:14:25.822 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's right.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you got
the Billy Club plan.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's right.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
man is a billionaire.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You share
esoterica with him

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and help him gain more
knowledge in his spiritual life.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And he helps you
continue to refine

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
how to work within the
money matrix of this planet.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that a little bit,

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that relationship,
but also where

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
he started with
you, and maybe some

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
tenants coming from him that

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.740 align:middle line:90%
are inculcated into this work.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Sure.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.542 align:middle line:84%
So I go to the Ritz
Carlton, if I'm in town.

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a Ritz Carlton
in Fort Lauderdale Beach

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:90%
where you can go for breakfast.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.797 align:middle line:84%
I used to walk up and
down doing my walking

00:15:00.797 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:90%
meditations every morning.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:90%
One day, I saw the sign.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.267 align:middle line:84%
I said, let me go in
for breakfast here.

00:15:04.267 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
That's like 10-- that
was 12 years ago.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:84%
10 years, so two years
after I started going there,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:84%
my waiter introduced me to the
other gentleman named Billy.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, you
guys are always here

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:90%
alone at the same exact time.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you guys talk?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:90%
So he introduced me.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.580 align:middle line:90%
I sat at the table.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:90%
We had breakfast.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And we started having
a great conversation.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We resonated on
the same frequency.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:84%
He's a billionaire who
owns multiple companies

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and has a lot of money
in the stock market.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was just doing my
thing and esoteric wisdom

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and understanding and
the 4Bidden Knowledge

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:90%
brand and everything else.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And so he wanted to feed
off me for that information.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:90%
He loved it.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was really
already on that path.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But he couldn't get
a lot of answers.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:10%
And then of course, me,
looking for the ways

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.977 align:middle line:10%
to find out how this
matrix really works

00:15:48.977 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:10%
and finding out what he
did and how he manipulated

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:10%
and how he was able to really
maximize the finances that he

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:10%
had and even how he started with
his own personal credit history

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:10%
from a kid and built
it up by financing a TV

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:10%
and just giving the TV away.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:90%
He didn't even need the TV.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted to
get credit started.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Little things like that,
that's playing in the matrix.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: You know?

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.840 align:middle line:90%
So he knew early on as well.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And so he gave me so
many phenomenal tidbits

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:84%
of information,
how to buy stock,

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
what options to get in and get
out, how to have confidence

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
in your decision,
how to research

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.165 align:middle line:84%
the proper stocks,
options, or funds,

00:16:21.165 --> 00:16:22.540 align:middle line:84%
which ones to get
in and get out,

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:84%
who his mentors
are in that area,

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and why he makes
these decisions,

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and also to give me the
confidence in making big moves.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Because prior to that, I
would make small moves,

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:84%
a few thousand here,
a few thousand there.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be horrified.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
As soon as something went
wrong, I pulled my money out.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: He goes, you
can't do that, man.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.723 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:16:39.723 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
He says, let me show you
one trade I just did today.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:90%
I put $500,000 on Verizon.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:90%
You know, it went up $8.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Then I did a swing trade.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:90%
I took the money out.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to make-- if
you want it big numbers,

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:90%
you've got to make big moves.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:90%
And you have to be confident.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.188 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've mastered
everything else.

00:16:54.188 --> 00:16:55.488 align:middle line:10%
You've got to master this.

00:16:55.488 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The confidence.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.063 align:middle line:84%
So he worked with me on
understanding and learning

00:16:59.063 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
how to master the research
behind investing into the stock

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.537 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:17:03.537 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
you share in here?

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I share it
in there, absolutely.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:10.069 align:middle line:84%
And then also things like how
to-- understanding mortgages,

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:90%
real estate.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:12.161 align:middle line:90%
He owns a big real estate firm.

00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:13.839 align:middle line:84%
Understanding
mortgages and lending.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Understanding all these
little intricate things

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.010 align:middle line:84%
that really can help you
maximize your portfolio.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So he really taught me
how to build my portfolio

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.151 align:middle line:84%
and diversify it and not to
keep your eggs in one basket.

00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:84%
Because then I did keep my
eggs in one basket before,

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I almost lost everything when
the real estate market crashed.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I was
telling him about that.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, let me show
you how I diversify.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:90%
And I've got money here.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:90%
I've got money there.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.590 align:middle line:90%
I've got things here.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And so he mixes everything up.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And he's been a
phenomenal teacher for me.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, pretty
much, it pays out.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: His advice pays out.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:46.948 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
got that in here.

00:17:46.948 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:90%
So people can say, oh, OK.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I can start digging
around for myself.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: 10 years of
research from me meeting

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:90%
with him is in the book.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now what about
some of the common names

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
you hear around the
markets in general?

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:84%
You hear like Mark Cuban for
example, some of these people.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Are there any people that
have kind of common names

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that you think, they
do their research.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:90%
They're pretty good.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.205 align:middle line:90%
That you respect--

00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Warren Buffett.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
Warren Buffett, yeah.

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Warren Buffett.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I mean, that's the
name he brings up the most.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: He
usually, wherever he

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:10%
flows, that's where things go.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.657 align:middle line:90%
That's one of his mentors.

00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it is?

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:17.205 align:middle line:90%
So you know, he's--

00:18:17.205 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Old school.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:18.790 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Old school.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Old school.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Serious old school.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:90%
That's flowing into him.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's flowing
from him to me.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:10%
So this notion about confidence
when someone is, say, just

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.260 align:middle line:10%
has enough money now
that they can even

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:10%
think of starting to make
external investments.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.775 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:18:36.775 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: First of all,
there's another subject here.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:10%
And that is the difference
between the male and female

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:10%
mindset.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't know if
you address that in the book

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:84%
because women have very
different set of kind

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.110 align:middle line:90%
of directives and interests.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So they're looking at
money like, how can I,

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
not only make this work for
my survival, but for my kids?

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know?

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.343 align:middle line:10%
So now do you go into these
different mindsets in the book?

00:18:59.343 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I don't
separate the mindsets.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But the mindset is really
general to what you just said.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's all
about legacy building.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.290 align:middle line:84%
This is really about
legacy building.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so it really does
take family and care of others

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.297 align:middle line:10%
into consideration.

00:19:11.297 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, absolutely.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so
looking at that, say,

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.373 align:middle line:10%
you're a young person
and you just have enough

00:19:16.373 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:10%
that you have a couple
pennies to rub together

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:10%
that you don't need right away.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.152 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
might want to start

00:19:21.152 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:90%
by investing in something.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:10%
So first of all,
would you suggest

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:10%
that a home is a good way
to go, to secure a home?

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Or would you say, hey,
just keep renting and maybe

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:84%
go over into this market
that's not as risky?

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.702 align:middle line:84%
What would you say for a
young person right now?

00:19:36.702 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It really kind
of varies a little bit

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.705 align:middle line:84%
depending on how their
credit is at that moment.

00:19:40.705 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Say, they
have decent credit.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: If they've
got decent credit

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.625 align:middle line:84%
and they've got
a couple dollars,

00:19:44.625 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend
getting a property,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:90%
a property they can live in.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:84%
If they can get a duplex,
that's even better.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they can
rent one side out,

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and they can live
in the other side.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And that one side can
cover the whole mortgage

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:90%
for the entire building.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They're living rent
free, mortgage free.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And they're
taking paying down

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.453 align:middle line:84%
a mortgage, which is now going
to report to their credit

00:20:01.453 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
history and give them a high
trade line, real estate trade

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And now they got renters.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And then once they get to a
certain point financially,

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:84%
they can then move on to
a nicer, bigger house,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:90%
if they want.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And they can rent
both of those out.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And then they got
rental income coming in.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I also
think a very good thing

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to do is to get
into property flips.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.583 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of wholesale
properties around this country.

00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
in the millions.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.542 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how
do people find out?

00:20:24.542 --> 00:20:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Everyone says, yeah, but
the banks have all those.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, no.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of websites
that have access.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For
wholesale properties?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.668 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: For wholesale
properties, yeah.

00:20:31.668 --> 00:20:34.727 align:middle line:84%
Myhousedeals.com, I go on
there every single day.

00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:36.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Myhousedeals.com,
OK, I'll write that down.

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Myhousedeals.com,
you go on there.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.463 align:middle line:84%
You pay $400 or
$500 for the year.

00:20:39.463 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And you get access to all
these wholesale properties

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.715 align:middle line:84%
every single day all
over the United States.

00:20:44.715 --> 00:20:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can-- I've
seen houses in there

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
for $25,000, $30,000 that
only need $5,000 or $6,000

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.963 align:middle line:84%
to fix up worth
$115,000, $120,000.

00:20:51.963 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So you can go in there
and buy property.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:90%
You can even--

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the flipping
market is still working?

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's still
working phenomenal.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's crazy
with what's happened

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.820 align:middle line:84%
to the economy, what's happened
to people's employment.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I know.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How come the
real estate market is still

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:10%
spinning out there?

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.222 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You know,
it's really incredible.

00:21:08.222 --> 00:21:10.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And rental market,
it's kind of a shame.

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And the rental
market, it's hard.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It's pricing a
lot of people out.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.417 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you're going to
find is a lot of the properties

00:21:16.417 --> 00:21:18.965 align:middle line:84%
now that you buy to flip,
they get flipped to investors.

00:21:18.965 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of the perception.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's
what's happening.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.290 align:middle line:90%
The investors are buying them.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.832 align:middle line:84%
And then the investors
rent them out.

00:21:24.832 --> 00:21:25.632 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:25.632 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So they're going
for maximum profit?

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:28.272 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right, exactly.

00:21:28.272 --> 00:21:29.707 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:29.707 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, where does
that line start blurring over

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
into then caring for others and
caring for your neighbor that

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.115 align:middle line:90%
need to have places to rent?

00:21:36.115 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, that's another
incentive that you can do.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
find people that

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
are in foreclosure
from these databases.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And then you can get
those properties from them,

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:90%
which saves the house.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you can rent the
properties back to them.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.908 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:21:48.908 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can rent the
property back to people

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.658 align:middle line:90%
who are in foreclosure.

00:21:51.658 --> 00:21:54.923 align:middle line:84%
You have got to qualify them at
least some way, shape, or form.

00:21:54.923 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:10%
But you can rent
the property back

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:10%
to them for a period
of time until they

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:10%
can get back on their feet
and buy it back from you.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.598 align:middle line:10%
Or you can give
them a time frame

00:22:00.598 --> 00:22:01.890 align:middle line:10%
that you can sell the property.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But you give them
an opportunity, the chance,

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:84%
not just kick them
out on the street.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.258 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And a lot of
those are coming due now

00:22:08.258 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:90%
because of what's been going on.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.097 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: There's a lot of
people that were so far behind.

00:22:13.097 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see, in 2022, a
lot of these new foreclosures.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And there's a
lot of people that would

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:90%
love to rent their house back.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:20.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:10%
So now going a little more
kind of to the core of it,

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.113 align:middle line:10%
so you're in a family that
has jobs that pay the bills.

00:22:29.113 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you have a
little bit saved up

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:90%
by the end of your life.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, there's
never really been a thought,

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:84%
from generationally, about
anyone building wealth.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
also not been anything

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.750 align:middle line:84%
where someone says, hey,
let's go get something

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:90%
at the expense of another.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because that's
a quick way to do it,

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:10%
but it's not a
good way to do it.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're just kind of
playing it straight generation

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:90%
after generation.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And you want to
break out and maybe

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:90%
feel something beyond that.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Where do you start working with
a person on a spiritual level

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.120 align:middle line:90%
regarding this?

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.495 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
I start with them

00:23:00.495 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:84%
understanding the
power of manifestation

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
conscious light waves.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really
where it all starts.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.078 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we can
go into that discussion.

00:23:08.078 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:84%
You've given us a little
hint of what's in here.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.472 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into some of the
underpinnings of that now.

00:23:12.472 --> 00:23:14.805 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, everything
starts from the consciousness

00:23:14.805 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:90%
platform.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.993 align:middle line:84%
Just like you have a platform
which is like social media

00:23:17.993 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
platform, you have a TV
network platform, everything,

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.500 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness platform
is the original and first

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:90%
platform.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.365 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And so
on that platform

00:23:26.365 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
is a platform of
light, light waves.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And so people don't really
believe or understand the power

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:84%
that they're using to
manifest on a daily basis.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you look
around us everywhere,

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.147 align:middle line:84%
everything has been manifested
from thought to reality.

00:23:38.147 --> 00:23:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Even this cup was thought in
a brain, and now it's here.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:90%
And I can touch it.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So it works the same way
in the financial markets.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It works the same
way in abundance.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
You have to, first,
go into a mindset

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that you want abundance, not
that you're hoping to get it.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a different mindset.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Hoping and wishing for
things is a low frequency.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You want to create
a wavelength, an amplitude

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and wavelength in your
mind that oscillates

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.560 align:middle line:84%
at a very fast pace, which
means that the waves are very

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.722 align:middle line:90%
close together, not spaced out.

00:24:06.722 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And so if you see-- if you put
a wave cap on somebody who's

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.055 align:middle line:84%
hoping and begging and
wishing for something,

00:24:11.055 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that the oscillation
is very slow and wide

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and that the amplitudes
are very high,

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:90%
the trough and the height.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.880 align:middle line:10%
When you get into a
person that is now

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:10%
believing that something
is happening or believing

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.450 align:middle line:10%
in the moment that it's
actually occurring--

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's what I was
just going to ask you about.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Continue.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.397 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That they're
an active participating

00:24:29.397 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:84%
in the now, that it's
for them, the wavelengths

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
will be very quick,
and very short.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And the wavelengths will
be short and very close

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
together, which means
they're at a high frequency.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody says, get in
a high, raise your vibration,

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:84%
raise your frequency,
it's a real statement.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a real scientific
statement that

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
can be measured on
a computer screen.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not like some
fancy, you know, gypsy stuff.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.052 align:middle line:90%
It's real science.

00:24:54.052 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when you take your
mind from the thought

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.470 align:middle line:84%
of hoping and
begging to commanding

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and being coherently a
part of the situation,

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that it's happening now,
the brain waves flip.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And the frequency goes higher.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:90%
And the wavelengths get closer.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, every
thought that you're thinking

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
goes out into space time,
every single thought

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of
your time you could think.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:10%
And so all those thoughts
are floating around in space

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:10%
with data on them.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.120 align:middle line:84%
That data is picked up from
the universal consciousness.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.337 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And then it swings
back around to all the things

00:25:25.337 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
that you need to make
those thoughts happen.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're coming out with
nothing but low frequencies,

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
back to low frequencies.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
When you call somebody on
the phone and say, hey,

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:90%
how are you?

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And they've always
got a problem.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.700 align:middle line:90%
They've always got an issue.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.120 align:middle line:90%
This happened.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.510 align:middle line:90%
That happened.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:90%
This happened.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Everything's always bad.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
They're always making bad
things happen for themselves

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:90%
because of their low frequency.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.812 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
to somebody who's

00:25:43.812 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
got a high-frequency
vibration, always

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.017 align:middle line:90%
good things happening nonstop.

00:25:47.017 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:90%
This person's lucky.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:48.870 align:middle line:90%
They're not lucky.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
They're vibrating
at a high frequency.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.782 align:middle line:10%
The law of attraction
works in both ways.

00:25:52.782 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:10%
So you have to start thinking
positive about finance.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Stop being afraid of it.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Fear is a low vibration,
low frequency.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.970 align:middle line:90%
People are afraid of finance.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Start thinking positive,
high-energy vibrations.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to command this.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to master this.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Like Billy told me, you
need to master this.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is the--

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:90%
really, assignment of will.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And will is an
interesting and tricky subject

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:17.090 align:middle line:10%
to yourself.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.860 align:middle line:10%
Because will often
butts up against what's

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.302 align:middle line:10%
in the subconscious mind.

00:26:20.302 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Yes, it does.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about that kind of interference

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:10%
pattern that comes in when
someone says, well, I can--

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:10%
I want to do that.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to start thinking
in that commanding way.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And this thing is
pulling them down.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can't
even identify it.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.395 align:middle line:90%
It's in the subconscious.

00:26:36.395 --> 00:26:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot in there.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah,
there's a lot in there.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:90%
So meditation is key now.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You have to clear
out the subconscious mind.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:90%
You have to clear out.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to let the cosmic
energy fill you up, fill up

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:45.970 align:middle line:90%
your cup.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So I go into this
manifestation meditations,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:84%
where I envision
a bowl in my mind.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And a hand is taking these
thoughts out of the bowl.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you can see the
thoughts once you focus on them.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:90%
You know what they are.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And then the
bowl becomes empty.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.782 align:middle line:84%
And in this
manifestation meditation,

00:26:57.782 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I fill the bowl back up
with thoughts about whatever

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.973 align:middle line:84%
it is I'm trying to
accomplish, whether it's

00:27:01.973 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
a car, a house, better finances,
abundance, whatever it is.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.080 align:middle line:90%
And I'm living that moment.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not hoping that these
things are going to happen.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.413 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing myself
driving that car.

00:27:11.413 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing myself
getting the keys

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and opening the
door to my house.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting on the couch,
looking around, turning the TV

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:84%
on, and watching ESPN on
the news or something.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.657 align:middle line:84%
I'm living in the moment
within the meditation,

00:27:20.657 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:90%
as if it already happened.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Because in that realm, it's
more real than this realm.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it has happened?

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once the thought's
out, it's happened.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Once the thought's
out, it's actually happened.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.902 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
positive way of doing it.

00:27:30.902 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And then in here, I
have an enormous list

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.958 align:middle line:84%
of positive
affirmations to help you

00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:90%
with the abundance in finances.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're supposed to say
these consistently all the time.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:10%
And those positive
affirmations, in coordination

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:10%
with the actual manifestation
meditations, and then,

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.720 align:middle line:10%
of course, using the tools and
the information and knowledge

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:10%
on how the finances work
and the positive mindset,

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:10%
I am going to master this,
not being afraid, but knowing

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:10%
that you're going to master
it is going to get you there.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You're right, Billy.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.180 align:middle line:10%
And I think the big leap here,
the leap in consciousness

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:10%
is understanding, just because
these things are pulling you

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:10%
down and making you feel
uncertain about yourself,

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:10%
you literally can--

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.010 align:middle line:10%
you could.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.120 align:middle line:10%
That might still be
pulling on your emotions.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:10%
But you have the choice
to break that pattern

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.720 align:middle line:10%
and say, no, I'm going to go all
in on this because I understand

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:10%
the nature.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.160 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's about understanding
the nature of reality.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:10%
It's not about
overwriting programs

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:10%
as much as
understanding, look, I

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:10%
can continue this feeling right
now, this thought right now.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm manifesting it in
the other dimensions.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come back and
whip me around a little bit.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Or I can just go
this other route.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Either way, I'm manifesting it.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Either
way, you manifest it.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Either way.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And also, if I go
to the restaurant,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.865 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm not supposed
to eat a muffin.

00:28:48.865 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Because a muffin is going
to give you a muffin top.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.080 align:middle line:90%
I got a decision to make.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to sacrifice
getting this muffin top?

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:54.888 align:middle line:90%
Or do I just not want--

00:28:54.888 --> 00:28:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I make that sacrifice.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: You know what I mean?

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.290 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'll have the muffin.

00:28:58.426 --> 00:29:00.185 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Or do I look want
to look good at the beach?

00:29:00.185 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's a decision.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's a decision.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a decision.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:90%
You have to choose.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So like I said, you
can lead a horse to water.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But you can't make them
drink because you're thirsty.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:84%
They have to be
thirsty for themselves.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Somebody has
to say, you know what?

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Enough is enough.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:90%
It's time for me to--

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I'm building
for generations.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The elite
people on this planet,

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.460 align:middle line:84%
they plan for five,
10, 15, 20 generations.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.698 align:middle line:84%
They plan, 1,000
years from now, this

00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:23.240 align:middle line:84%
is what we want to
see on the planet.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They're not thinking
about paycheck next Saturday.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Everybody's going,
when I get paid on Friday,

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go here on the
weekend and blah, blah, blah.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.720 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking 5,000,
6,000, 10,000 years ahead.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, why?

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.720 align:middle line:90%
I should be doing that too.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How about you?

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
thinking ahead.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I'm thinking--

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How far do
you project ahead?

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.512 align:middle line:90%
And what do you see that?

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, because now you can bring
the light, the manifestation,

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:84%
the awakening of consciousness
to the degree it's going to.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a
really weird bifurcation

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness right now.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.047 align:middle line:84%
But for those who
want that journey,

00:29:52.047 --> 00:29:54.380 align:middle line:84%
what do you see that journey
looking like in the future?

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: My goal--

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even beyond the
world that we have structured

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.372 align:middle line:90%
financially right now.

00:29:58.372 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I told my kids I'm
planning for five generations.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And because between
the planning for the five

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.065 align:middle line:84%
generations, the
spiritual teachings,

00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and the manifestation
techniques,

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:84%
the financial
training and teaching,

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:84%
by the fifth generation,
it should be automatically

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.442 align:middle line:90%
embedded into the--

00:30:13.442 --> 00:30:15.650 align:middle line:84%
through the RNA, which comes
down through the father.

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.275 align:middle line:84%
And it should be
embedded into the RNA.

00:30:17.275 --> 00:30:19.113 align:middle line:84%
It should be epigenetic
memory by then.

00:30:19.113 --> 00:30:21.530 align:middle line:10%
The reason why there are certain
races on this planet that

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.020 align:middle line:10%
seem to strive financially
better than others,

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:10%
besides oppression and
all these other things,

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.400 align:middle line:10%
it's because it's in the DNA.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:90%
It's in the epigenetics.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's been
reinforced for so long.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: So long.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't even-- certain
races of people don't even

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:90%
expect to be poor.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not even a thought.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It doesn't mean
they're all billionaires.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: But there's this--

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
they're not thinking

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.300 align:middle line:90%
in terms of subsistence living.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:84%
They know there's
confidence inside.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be OK.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.153 align:middle line:84%
I can always get a job, at
least that level of thinking.

00:30:50.153 --> 00:30:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And you're absolutely right.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're working on.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's how it was
in white America in 1960.

00:30:55.635 --> 00:30:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Post-World
War II white America,

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:59.990 align:middle line:90%
that was just an understanding.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:01.657 align:middle line:84%
There was no thought
that you were going

00:31:01.657 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:90%
to miss your mortgage payment.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.270 align:middle line:84%
You could always pick
up a job at an insurance

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:90%
agency or a widget factory.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.865 align:middle line:10%
There was plenty to be had.

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:08.665 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:31:08.665 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
world has changed.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Those jobs aren't
to be had anymore.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's all
diversified now.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Having it all
laid out for you, where

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.643 align:middle line:84%
you can go from 21 to 65 and get
your gold watch, that's over.

00:31:19.643 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's over.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.977 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
it does come down

00:31:21.977 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
to understand the nature of
reality of how we create.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what you're saying
is so incredibly true.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk about your
own personal meditations.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:90%
You told me this morning--

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.560 align:middle line:90%
because you're a model of this.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.393 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you live it.

00:31:34.393 --> 00:31:35.193 align:middle line:90%
You walk it.

00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:36.380 align:middle line:90%
You're teaching your kids.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully they're going to be
living it, walking it, teaching

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:90%
their kids.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.203 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But you get up.

00:31:41.203 --> 00:31:43.370 align:middle line:84%
You got up at 3 o'clock in
the morning in your hotel

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.170 align:middle line:90%
before coming here.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:90%
You did your meditation.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you did your
workout for an hour, you know?

00:31:49.955 --> 00:31:50.755 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:31:50.755 --> 00:31:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And everything
about your shows, the clarity

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.650 align:middle line:84%
of thought, your elegance,
your physical appearance

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and condition.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Everything you
put your energy to

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.577 align:middle line:84%
is apparent the second
anybody meets you.

00:32:02.577 --> 00:32:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:04.618 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You walk your talk.

00:32:04.618 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about
how that meditation

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.240 align:middle line:90%
goes for you in the morning.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have so many
things coming up here

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.570 align:middle line:84%
in the next few months
with my business.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get on a platform
for a crowdfunding campaign.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
of strategic things

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.400 align:middle line:90%
that need to happen first.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've been
doing is focusing

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.230 align:middle line:84%
on manifesting that
and maximizing it.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Because now the SEC has
changed the rules because

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:84%
of the situation and
given a higher cap on what

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:90%
you can do in the first round.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of GoFundMe type
campaigns or crowdfunding.

00:32:36.575 --> 00:32:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right, exactly.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.195 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Business crowdfunding.

00:32:38.195 --> 00:32:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.218 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And so I'm
trying to find a way

00:32:40.218 --> 00:32:42.110 align:middle line:90%
to have a successful campaign.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And through the manifestation
techniques, doors are opening.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Things are opening.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on this phenomenal
path of enlightenment where--

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:84%
see, through the
manifestation meditation,

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:84%
what happens is the
law of attraction

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.830 align:middle line:84%
brings back what you
want and what you need.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.620 align:middle line:10%
But it doesn't exactly
manifest it instant.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.027 align:middle line:84%
It gives you windows
and doors that are open

00:33:01.027 --> 00:33:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and plugs you in
connection to things.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to have
discernment here.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Because these things
will come into your life

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that will connect you
to the next thing.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
discern, like, this

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.320 align:middle line:84%
is helping you get to your end
goal, it'll pass you right by.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.750 align:middle line:90%
This is really important.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.270 align:middle line:90%
This is true in business.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:90%
It's true in relationships.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you, in
a relationship,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.470 align:middle line:84%
meet a person just to prep you
for a certain understanding

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.012 align:middle line:84%
of something to meet
the next person.

00:33:26.012 --> 00:33:26.812 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:33:26.812 --> 00:33:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you put
it all on red there.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, so this
discernment, when

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.640 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
looking at something

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and knowing just that you've got
to follow it to the next step,

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:90%
do you know immediately?

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Or have you learned
to discern what's

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.005 align:middle line:84%
just the next step versus
the end of the journey?

00:33:44.005 --> 00:33:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
what I've learned

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is that the human
brain perceives

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.170 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen next up
to seven seconds in advance.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:84%
These are real
scientific studies.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they are.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And so what
the average person

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.900 align:middle line:84%
is doing is, through
my studies I found,

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:84%
that they're just like
sitting in the ocean.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.715 align:middle line:90%
And the wave crashes over them.

00:34:00.715 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And when the wave
crashes, that's

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.445 align:middle line:84%
when they realize the
moment has happened.

00:34:04.445 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And by then, it's too late.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Just like
if you hear a plane go

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.470 align:middle line:84%
supersonic, a jet, once you
hear the noise, it's gone.

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:11.270 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.179 align:middle line:10%
Once a wave crashes, it's over.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So through understanding
and having a higher

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness,
you learn

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.530 align:middle line:84%
to ride the wave, the
wave of space time.

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.929 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, you
can be closer to real time.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not
living in real time.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.210 align:middle line:90%
We're living in delayed time.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:34:26.575 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You can
be within that two

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
to three-second period of
knowing what's happening,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.540 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen next.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.899 align:middle line:84%
And by that method, you're
living closer to real time.

00:34:34.899 --> 00:34:35.699 align:middle line:90%
You live in closer.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:36.630 align:middle line:90%
You have better discernment.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.770 align:middle line:90%
You have better understanding.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.498 align:middle line:84%
you would apply that in
your morning meditation

00:34:40.498 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
to this new
crowdfunding cap issue

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.760 align:middle line:90%
that you have to contend with.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.590 align:middle line:84%
What would that look
like in your meditation?

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.007 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: In my
meditation, what I

00:34:47.007 --> 00:34:48.889 align:middle line:90%
see is the end before the end.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.764 align:middle line:84%
So I don't worry about
the steps to get there

00:34:50.764 --> 00:34:53.306 align:middle line:84%
because the universe is going
to provide all the steps I need

00:34:53.306 --> 00:34:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and all the players that
are going to need to play.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:55.969 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: What I
envision seeing is

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.680 align:middle line:84%
the success, the
operations improving,

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.270 align:middle line:90%
the staff building up.

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I can also see myself
celebrating and having

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.560 align:middle line:84%
a celebration with my new staff
and all these different things

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.250 align:middle line:84%
happening for that
particular business.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I even envision
seeing moving forward

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
into the next step, which is
going to be like a phase two.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So all these things, I'm
living it and experiencing it

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:90%
through the meditation.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.330 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
controlled dream.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't worry about the
little intricate details.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.788 align:middle line:84%
Because all those will
fall right into place

00:35:27.788 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
when I need them
and how I need them.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
really critical.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
would say, wow.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:32.843 align:middle line:90%
He's in control of everything.

00:35:32.843 --> 00:35:34.010 align:middle line:90%
He's in control of his life.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.425 align:middle line:84%
But letting go of those interim
steps, I've always found,

00:35:37.425 --> 00:35:38.225 align:middle line:90%
is critical.

00:35:38.225 --> 00:35:39.025 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:35:39.025 --> 00:35:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I'm a
little tiny person, compared

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:42.950 align:middle line:90%
to you on this financial scale.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But I've been able to
manifest through exactly

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:90%
the same principles.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Nice.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just
a little lazier.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't put as many
hours in on it.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.460 align:middle line:84%
But I've done it through
the same principles.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:10%
And it's just hard for
people to understand.

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to control
and let your mind

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.290 align:middle line:84%
say, OK, now, OK, maybe
I can make a phone call

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:90%
to this person.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stop it.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Because that person, whoever
the person is, will be there,

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.450 align:middle line:84%
or you will get the
inspiration after you're out

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:15.380 align:middle line:90%
of your meditation.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.220 align:middle line:90%
I need to call them.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.190 align:middle line:90%
And it'll be there.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:20.545 align:middle line:84%
And so talk about this
need of not only having

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:21.920 align:middle line:84%
a clear understanding
of what you

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.850 align:middle line:84%
want but a very clear need
to let go of the process.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.303 align:middle line:84%
Like Yoda said, you have to be
willing to let go of everything

00:36:29.303 --> 00:36:30.160 align:middle line:90%
you fear to lose.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:30.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:30.505 --> 00:36:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: OK?

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's key.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is key.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And so when
you're trying to hold

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.020 align:middle line:90%
on to everything--

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I had a meeting one
time with another guy.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.590 align:middle line:90%
This guy was a multimillionaire.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:41.623 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
Billy, you'll be rich.

00:36:41.623 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:90%
But you'll never be wealthy.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to
teach me a lesson.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:44.350 align:middle line:90%
You'll be rich.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:45.517 align:middle line:90%
But you'll never be wealthy.

00:36:45.517 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:90%
I was like, wow.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.528 align:middle line:90%
Why would you say that?

00:36:47.528 --> 00:36:50.210 align:middle line:84%
He says, because you're trying
to micromanage every aspect

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.010 align:middle line:90%
of your businesses.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And you want to be
involved in every single thing.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And you want to do
every single thing.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:55.630 align:middle line:90%
You never make it.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.005 align:middle line:84%
He said, you have to be able
to learn how to delegate out

00:36:58.005 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:84%
the workload to other people
and put together teams of people

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.620 align:middle line:84%
that you can trust and
you can build with.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.000 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you'll
never be wealthy.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's a difference
between rich and wealth.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, there is.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.682 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
at that level.

00:37:08.682 --> 00:37:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But if we're talking
at a different level

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.340 align:middle line:84%
where the rest of
us play, it might

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.370 align:middle line:84%
be this job or this
thing you'd like to do

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.570 align:middle line:90%
that you want to manifest.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.370 align:middle line:10%
It's the same principle.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:22.102 align:middle line:84%
But you're just talking about
your unseen partners and forces

00:37:22.102 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that are working it out for
you because it might only

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.620 align:middle line:90%
be one phone call away--

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --for example.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: True.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to have faith
in Life with a capital L.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I think
is probably the biggest

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:38.710 align:middle line:84%
detriment to society is not
having faith in life itself,

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:84%
placing it in
everything but the fact

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.070 align:middle line:90%
that all these forces are there.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're seeking
to uplift you and fulfill

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.215 align:middle line:90%
these desires.

00:37:48.215 --> 00:37:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:49.780 align:middle line:90%
That's actually the key.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not there
to work against you.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:53.125 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's not there
to work against you.

00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And with the positive,
the right mindset,

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:58.180 align:middle line:84%
these things literally
I've seen it happen.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Manifesting is so
easy for me now, I'm

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.570 align:middle line:84%
almost being very cautious
for what I think about.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Because you've got
to be careful what you ask for.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And sometimes
when you manifest,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.200 align:middle line:84%
you can bring things into your
reality that will give you

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.130 align:middle line:90%
the manifestation.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.210 align:middle line:90%
But there will be a side effect.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:16.000 align:middle line:90%
This is cause and effect.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.860 align:middle line:84%
This is one of
hermetic principles

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.530 align:middle line:84%
that you have to be willing to
now analyze this manifestation.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:23.800 align:middle line:84%
If I manifest this, there could
be a potential cause and effect

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that could be not favorable
for somebody else.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Do I want to go ahead
and pull this in and affect

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.200 align:middle line:84%
this person or these
people or this situation?

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.825 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got to
make tough decisions.

00:38:34.825 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that's
wisdom and maturity though.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where
more spiritual, I think,

00:38:39.035 --> 00:38:40.610 align:middle line:90%
principles would come into play.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.860 align:middle line:84%
That's more
spiritual principles.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.985 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could have
manifested an old relationship

00:38:43.985 --> 00:38:45.170 align:middle line:90%
if I wanted to.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:90%
But I had to think.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.830 align:middle line:84%
That's not-- see, I'm
being I'm being greedy.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:90%
It's just all for me personally.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
create a situation

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.880 align:middle line:90%
for other parties involved.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And so now, do I want
to do this for myself

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.502 align:middle line:90%
and make myself feel happy?

00:39:00.502 --> 00:39:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Or do I want to
make this sacrifice

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and realize that's not
the best decision for me

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.720 align:middle line:90%
to work on manifesting.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Let that go.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.382 align:middle line:90%
Let them be happy.

00:39:07.382 --> 00:39:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
talking about consequences.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Consequences.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Consequences of the
things you choose to manifest.

00:39:11.575 --> 00:39:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how would
that look in a meditation?

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.375 align:middle line:84%
Would you use your bowl and
the thoughts and take them out?

00:39:16.375 --> 00:39:18.785 align:middle line:84%
Or what other meditation
would you use for consequence?

00:39:18.785 --> 00:39:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's
actually how I did it.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it is?

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:21.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Because when I see
all these things, you know,

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.990 align:middle line:90%
I review the potentials.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Like when I do my
workshops, I teach people,

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.400 align:middle line:84%
if you want to bring something
into your reality zone,

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.160 align:middle line:84%
you got to realize that there
are superposition potentials.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.140 align:middle line:10%
Everything exists as
a way for potentials.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And so based
on the decision you make,

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.920 align:middle line:84%
it's going to pull one of
those into your reality.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.710 align:middle line:90%
So I envision these potentials.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And I realize, if I
make this decision,

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.580 align:middle line:90%
this is a potential side effect.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Because every decision has
a side effect, whether--

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has an effect.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It has a
consequence, whether it's

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:50.890 align:middle line:90%
a good one or a bad one.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And so I
try to just focus

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
on the ones that have
good consequences.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I realize that bringing
in manifestations that generate

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.760 align:middle line:84%
negative consequences to someone
else or some other situation

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.560 align:middle line:84%
is going to generate
bad karma for me.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's down to
your incredible level

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.097 align:middle line:84%
of maturity and wisdom
at this point in life.

00:40:08.097 --> 00:40:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And you've had to learn a
few things the hard way.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.598 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, Billy, we only
have a few minutes left.

00:40:12.598 --> 00:40:17.307 align:middle line:84%
So getting in, digging deeper
into this 688-page book,

00:40:17.307 --> 00:40:19.390 align:middle line:84%
we only skimmed the surface
of a couple of things,

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:20.410 align:middle line:90%
a couple of principles.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I love that you shared the
bold meditation with us

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:84%
because we can see
this can be used

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:84%
for any number of
manifestations or for clarity

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
and discernment.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So give us a couple
more principles

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.810 align:middle line:84%
we can go away with for those
who aren't going to get around

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.640 align:middle line:90%
to reading the whole book.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:40.835 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to be willing
to be very real with yourself.

00:40:40.835 --> 00:40:42.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest
problem we all have.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.382 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't want to
be real with where they are.

00:40:45.382 --> 00:40:46.840 align:middle line:84%
We can have a
private conversation.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.150 align:middle line:84%
You may want to admit to
me that I'm weak at this

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:51.400 align:middle line:90%
or I'm weak in that area.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Be firm with yourself.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm really
weak in these areas.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.910 align:middle line:84%
These are things-- get a
piece of paper and a pen.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Write down the areas,
financially, that I'm weak in.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.208 align:middle line:84%
And then say to yourself,
I need to learn this.

00:41:03.208 --> 00:41:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I can go out here,
and I can research

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:05.560 align:middle line:90%
all these different things.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I can watch all
these YouTube videos.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.470 align:middle line:84%
I can study all
these other things.

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I study this?

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Something that's going
to directly benefit

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:13.070 align:middle line:90%
me and future generations.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing I would do.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Be honest with yourself.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:15.965 align:middle line:90%
What are you weak in?

00:41:15.965 --> 00:41:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Stop putting it away.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Stop hiding from it.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.110 align:middle line:90%
We hide from the things.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.177 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We still
want to be able to do

00:41:21.177 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:84%
what we want to do instead
of making certain sacrifices.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.960 align:middle line:84%
In order to get
ahead with yourself,

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.940 align:middle line:84%
financially, and your
other generations,

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.250 align:middle line:84%
you have to be willing
to make sacrifices.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.780 align:middle line:90%
It can't all be fun and games.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.280 align:middle line:84%
You still want to
have fun and live.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I teach people how
to also live in here.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.558 align:middle line:84%
It's not all like robotic
financial this, this, this.

00:41:37.558 --> 00:41:39.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And talk
about that, the place

00:41:39.225 --> 00:41:40.900 align:middle line:84%
of living alongside
it because Americans

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.670 align:middle line:84%
are accused of
being workaholics.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.260 align:middle line:84%
They take two
weeks for vacation,

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:84%
which is literally considered
abuse in other countries.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's focus for just a minute
on what the living part means

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.680 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The living part is
when you find your passion

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and you work within
your passion, that's

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:56.692 align:middle line:90%
the most important thing.

00:41:56.692 --> 00:41:58.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the big trick
to this whole thing.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.602 align:middle line:84%
Then you can smell the
roses while you work.

00:42:00.602 --> 00:42:02.310 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you were
enjoying the work.

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, truly.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.712 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You're
getting satisfaction

00:42:04.712 --> 00:42:06.510 align:middle line:84%
from the outcome of
your actual work.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy exchange.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.970 align:middle line:90%
And the side effect is money.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And when
you're doing that,

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:13.050 align:middle line:84%
you get a chance to live
the life of your dreams

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:84%
because you're doing
something that you truly love.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
premise of the book.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And there has
never been a better time

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.170 align:middle line:10%
to just be yourself than right
now because the old structures

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:22.950 align:middle line:10%
are gone.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:24.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They're not
there for you anymore.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.567 align:middle line:90%
So what do you have to lose?

00:42:25.567 --> 00:42:28.678 align:middle line:84%
What does anyone have to lose
to identifying their own truth

00:42:28.678 --> 00:42:29.595 align:middle line:90%
and their own passion?

00:42:29.595 --> 00:42:30.622 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:42:30.622 --> 00:42:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Billy,
thank you so much.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:32.913 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:42:32.913 --> 00:42:35.987 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I need to
hire you as my coach.

00:42:35.987 --> 00:42:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and I want to add one thing.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah?

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Billy Club.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:41.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wrote yourself
a check for $1 billion

00:42:41.455 --> 00:42:46.427 align:middle line:84%
and yet to be due in five years'
time, the billion dollar club.

00:42:46.427 --> 00:42:47.385 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly, yes.

00:42:47.385 --> 00:42:49.110 align:middle line:84%
The billion dollar
club, the Billy Club,

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:49.860 align:middle line:90%
that's where I'm headed.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's
for generations.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:51.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not for me.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.040 align:middle line:90%
It's for the future generations.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
Billy, you're not

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.330 align:middle line:84%
an ordinary human being walking
on this planet, obviously.

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And we totally
appreciate what you are

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and what you show us
and share with us.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Billy is full of such
tantalizing scientific wisdom.
