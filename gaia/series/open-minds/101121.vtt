00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:29.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In
my last conversation

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:10%
with Randall Carlson, we
discussed the ancient meaning

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:10%
behind some of the more
well-known numbers used

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:10%
in sacred texts.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to look at
how those numbers, geometry,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
geology, and sacred and
mystical architecture

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:84%
tell us about our human
history, both past and future.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And that goes to some
pretty grim places

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
human experience,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.280 align:middle line:84%
in terms of catastrophe,
cycles of catastrophe.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say we ended
our last show talking I said,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:90%
so what's up with 666?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:84%
How did it get this
beastly connotation?

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And that led us to
the conversation.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.286 align:middle line:84%
You said, well, it's classically
always connected with the sun.

00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:05.243 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDALL CARLSON: Yes.

00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How can the sun
have a beastly connotation?

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
left our conversation.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: Well, it brings us
to the idea of a variable sun.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is something that's
been very controversial

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:10%
within scientific circles
and is by no means accepted.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And particularly
these days, there's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
been a-- I'll call it an
agenda to dismiss any evidence

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
for a variable sun.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:10%
Because once we recognize
that the sun may

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:10%
vary in its intensity or what
Jay Widener has been working

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:10%
with is the idea of
coronal mass ejections-

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.279 align:middle line:10%
that was the subject of
Robert Schoch's last book.

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:10%
I think there's a considerable
amount of evidence

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:10%
that supports the idea
of a variable sun.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that goes contrary
to some of the agendas today

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:84%
that are attempting to dismiss
the influence of the sun

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:84%
as far as questions
of climate change.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.459 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that
becomes very political.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: It does.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've got
carbon tax credits that

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
need to be allocated and
people who benefit from those.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a
political agenda.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
there's enough evidence

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
out there, both from the hard
scientific realm but also

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
from the archaic traditions,
to suggest that the sun has

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
a degree of
variability that could

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:84%
have considerable consequences
for life on Earth.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:10%
And so I think that if
we're talking about 666

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:10%
being a solar number-- and
there are many examples of that,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:10%
and these are some of the kinds
of things that I can actually

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:10%
provide on my website, some
of the more detailed analysis

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:10%
and examples of these
things for people to access

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:10%
and how that shows up in
ancient traditions and so on.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But the idea, I think, is
that there could be times

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:84%
when the sun's output
changes, for whatever reason,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and it, again, could have
considerable consequences

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
as far as life on the
surface of the Earth.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:10%
In Jay's book that he
wrote on the Hendaye stone,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:10%
there is an effigy
on one of the faces

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:10%
of the stone of the solar
orb where it clearly

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:10%
seems to signify that there are
two degrees of radiant output

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:10%
to the sun.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And it very much recapitulates
some of the symbolism

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
that we've actually found like
that shows up into the Tarot

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:84%
deck, this idea that
the sun may have

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:90%
two types of radiant output.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that possibly
the negative connotation

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
could come from a tradition
or a knowledge of--

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A catastrophic
event at the hands

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:90%
of the sun, so to speak.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.836 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: You've
got it, exactly.

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for putting
those words in my mouth.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was trying to say.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] What the sun
giveth, the sun can taketh away

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.271 align:middle line:90%
by way of life.

00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And I
mentioned to you earlier,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe on the break, that
a culture, for example, living

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
in the Sahara Desert is going
to have a different relationship

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:84%
with the sun, say, than
the Scandinavians living

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
at 60 degrees north
latitude where

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:84%
the sun shows two or three
months out of the year.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
that's possibly

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
what is being implicated
here, is this idea

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.190 align:middle line:84%
that the number 666,
number one, it's

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:84%
always associated with
the sun, archangels

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
of the sun, many
different gods associated

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
with the sun, Abraxas
and Mithras and so on.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:84%
But actually, in the
biblical verse itself,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really necessarily
imply a negative connotation.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
The biblical verse
reads, here is

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.726 align:middle line:84%
wisdom; let him who
hath understanding count

00:04:59.726 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
the number of the beast,
for it in the number

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:90%
of man, 600 threescore and six.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the assumption is in the
more fundamentalist models

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
they're extracted from
the biblical writings.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a conflation of the
beast, the Antichrist, Lucifer,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:90%
the devil.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I think these are all
distinct concepts.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And we can't just
necessarily interchange them.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:84%
The beast is not necessarily
the same as diablo, the devil.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily the same
as Lucifer, the quote unquote,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
which literally translates
as "bringer of light."

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:90%
And that always puzzled me.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can come back to
that as we proceed here

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.897 align:middle line:90%
when we start talking about--

00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we've
delved into the Urantia work

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit in a
few interviews also

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that talks about the
nature of Lucifer

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and the Luciferian
rebellion and what

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
happened in those early
times as well, yeah.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And that's
something I've never really

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
had the time to access
is the Urantia works.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.087 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're busy.

00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: There's a lot
of information out there.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
big book. [LAUGHS]

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.866 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah.

00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
My focus has been on
I'm trying to bridge

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:84%
the archaic traditions with
modern scientific findings.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, well,
let's talk about

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.006 align:middle line:84%
modern scientific
findings and solar flares.

00:06:15.006 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
common things that

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:84%
occur that we know of
that they've already

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
been able to chronicle when it
comes to sizable solar flares.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Oh, yeah,
I mean obviously

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.825 align:middle line:90%
our technologies are vulnerable.

00:06:26.825 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's a concern.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And up to this point,
we've been lucky.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The intensity of these
events hasn't been such

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that it's caused any kind
of a serious economic effect

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.415 align:middle line:90%
or technological breakdown.

00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is not my
field of expertise,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:84%
but certainly for that,
I think Jay and people

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
like Robert Schoch who've
really gone into this

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:84%
have made a pretty strong case
that that's one of the factors.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everybody
pretty much knows

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:84%
about the notion of solar
flares and having some outages

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.249 align:middle line:90%
in computer systems.

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
That's subtle technology
that's working

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:90%
with electrical impulses.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.814 align:middle line:84%
So we get it's having an effect
on those electrical systems.

00:07:05.814 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So what's it doing
to our bodies, right?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.799 align:middle line:84%
It's having an effect on
our electromagnetic system--

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Good question.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and the
planet and all life forms.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can see how--
I can understand

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
how the sun and
that connotation,

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:84%
if you have a
sizable enough blast,

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
would not be considered a
positive event on the planet.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: Yeah,
in mythology, we

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:10%
see a lot of this where what
is normally a benevolent god

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:10%
or goddess, like Hathor in
Egypt, Egyptian tradition,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.970 align:middle line:10%
was normally a very
benevolent, nurturing goddess,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:10%
but on occasion
she could lose it.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And then she would
transform into Sekhmet.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:10%
And you didn't want
to deal with Sekhmet.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:10%
Sekhmet was the
lion-headed goddess

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:10%
who actually, at
the command of Ra,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:10%
went down and basically
slayed mankind.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
In the Egyptian version of
the destruction of the world,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:90%
that was Sekhmet.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But Sekhmet was the destructive
counterpart to Hathor,

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.005 align:middle line:90%
who is normally, like I said--

00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Benevolent.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.040 align:middle line:90%
There's an old English proverb.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:90%
How does it go, again?

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that we
can't live without heat.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:90%
We can't live without the sun.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:90%
We can't live without water.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But in some cases, water
can be totally destructive.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be talking
about that as we

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.385 align:middle line:84%
get on here and the stories
of the great deluge.

00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you've used
the term antedeluvian,

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:90%
that means pre-flood.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And we've always
assumed to the extent

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
that rational science
has even acknowledged

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:84%
the fact that there is this
widespread, universal tradition

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.489 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:45.312 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In all
ancient religions.

00:08:45.312 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Yes,
all over the world,

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
this myth about the destruction
of the world by water.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Not quite as well known,
but also very prevalent

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
are myths about the destruction
of the world by fire.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
Bible, interestingly, it's

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:90%
kind of bookending.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
At the front end in Genesis, we
have Noah and the destruction

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:90%
of the world by water.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And then in the apocalyptic
visions at the end of the book,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
it's the destruction
of the world by fire.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.021 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And hellfire
and damnation.

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Exactly, exactly.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can take those
and dismiss them out

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:84%
of hand as just being
the superstitious ravings

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
or imaginations of a
pre-scientific, barbaric mind,

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:84%
or we can acknowledge
that maybe, perhaps,

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:84%
those traditions
reflect real events,

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that there's a reality
behind those myths.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And as a geomythologist
or an astromythologist,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
that is one of the
tenets of these emerging

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
disciplines of geomythology
and astromythology,

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
is that behind these
myths, there are realities

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and that those myths can lead
us into a deeper understanding

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:90%
of what those realities are.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think some of the
work-- I recently interviewed

00:10:01.548 --> 00:10:04.080 align:middle line:84%
David Talbot, who of course
is associated with Walter

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Thornhill, and I think
a lot of their work

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.970 align:middle line:90%
is demonstrating exactly that.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're even able to look
under electron microscopes

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.970 align:middle line:84%
at the actual physical
phenomena that

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
created those ancient symbols
and what that meant on a larger

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:90%
cosmological level.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:90%
So it is coming together.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It is coming together that
these weren't just stories.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
have one story that

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
persists throughout history
and across the globe?

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Right,
well, one way around

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that has always been to say,
well, if this or that tribe--

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.127 align:middle line:90%
like American Indian tribes.

00:10:37.127 --> 00:10:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, they heard it
from missionaries.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: But look at like
for example George Catlin,

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:10%
the famous Indian artist
who spent decades--

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:10%
he wrote his book "Last Rambles
Amongst the American Indians."

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.930 align:middle line:84%
He spent decades roaming around,
and he visited over 120 tribes

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
throughout North
and Central America.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the epilogue
of his book, that

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:84%
amongst all of
these tribes, they

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
have many different traditions,
they many languages,

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
unique and different customs,
but what they all had in common

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:84%
was a memory of a great deluge
and that their tribe, whichever

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
tribe, was descended from the
survivors of this great deluge.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, a big part of what I've
been doing over the last 20

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.260 align:middle line:84%
years is travelling over North
America documenting the hard

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:84%
physical evidence that yes,
there really was gigantic,

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
inconceivably huge floods
that swept over this continent

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the last ice age.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's those
events that I think

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.580 align:middle line:84%
are being preserved in these
Native American traditions.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, so
let's talk about when

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at cosmic patterns
and cycles of catastrophe.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that's
most commonly pointed to.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're looking
at generally now

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
it seems people are looking at
around 13,000 years ago, right?

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Half of a precessional cycle.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Exactly, half
of a precessional cycle.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
In the last show, we talked
about the number 25,920.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
If you could take that
and cut that in half,

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:90%
it's 12,960, which is--

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is rounding
it out to 26 and 13.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: 26 and
13, yeah, but just

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:84%
to tie it back to those sacred
numbers we were talking about.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:84%
25, 30 years ago, as
I was immersing myself

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
into the studies of
these archaic traditions

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:84%
about patterns and cycles
and so forth, those numbers

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.880 align:middle line:84%
kept coming up over
and over again, right?

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
It was clear to me
that they sure seemed

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
to be pointing to
something happening,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:90%
say, 13,000 years ago.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, while I'm doing
this, and actually I

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
gave a series of lectures at
Warren Wilson College in 1996,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
where I was pointing
out that as a date,

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:84%
that something extraordinary
happened, right?

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And I at that point had not read
Graham Hancock's "Fingerprints

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:90%
of the Gods" yet.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to me, he
had just published a book

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
where he amasses
all of this evidence

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and concludes that
all of this stuff

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
seems to be pointing
to something

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:90%
at that epoch occurring, right?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So independently, we had
come to this same conclusion.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had come to it
mainly from looking

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
at ancient symbolism and
these ancient patterns

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and the numbers that were
associated with them.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I traveled
over Europe in 1989,

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that I did was I

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:90%
went to a lot of the cathedrals.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.518 align:middle line:84%
I was mainly looking
at the architecture.

00:13:45.518 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:10%
But what really struck
me in the symbolism

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:10%
particularly--
Chartres Cathedral

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:10%
is a beautiful example, OK?

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:10%
When you walk up to the Western
facade of Chartres Cathedral

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:10%
at the Portal of
Judgment, as it's called,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:10%
and that's a reference
to judgment day, what

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:10%
we see there is the effigy
of Christ, Christ in majesty,

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:10%
seated within the
vesica, which is

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:10%
the preeminent feminine symbol.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
It's also the symbol
that represents

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:84%
the inauguration of the
whole of sacred geometry.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Because through the
overlapping of two circles

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle line:84%
of equal diameter such that
the circumference of one

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
falls on the center
of the other,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
you get this-- a
mathematician would think it

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:84%
as a Venn diagram,
this overlap, which

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
is this lozenge-shaped
almost boat-shaped figure.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And out of that emerges the
whole edifice of geometry,

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:84%
the whole edifice of Euclidean
geometry, all of the forms

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:90%
and patterns emerge from that.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, it
is like a womb.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:84%
But it was also imagined as
a gateway between worlds,

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:90%
between domains.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
Chartres Cathedral

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and many of the others, you see
the master sits in that vesica

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.160 align:middle line:90%
as if he's the gatekeeper.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And he is usually pictured
with a book in hand.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the book
is shown open.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's closed.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:84%
If it's open, that's indicating
within that symbolical edifice,

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
there is a teaching that is now
being divulged unto the world.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric is
becoming exoteric.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
If the book is closed, it's
indicating to the initiate

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that there's a secret there,
a secret that's not yet

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
ready to be revealed
to the world.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see it both ways.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
gatekeepers are often

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:84%
known to us as prominent figures
in our religious history,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:84%
as beings who came along to
impart a certain knowledge

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:90%
at a given time.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: There are
effigies of Buddha

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:90%
seated within the same vesica.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And vesica comes from
the same as the word

00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
vessel, which means like a
container that carries us

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:90%
from one domain to another, OK?

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So in Chartres
Cathedral, you've got

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.935 align:middle line:84%
Christ in majesty seated
within the vesica.

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:84%
It's referred to
as the mandoral.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It's up in the tympanum
above the doorway.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Surrounding are the four
beasts of the apocalypse,

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
which are also the four
evangelists, Matthew, Mark,

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Luke, and John, in
the exoteric sense.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:84%
In the esoteric sense, it
represents the four seasons

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.590 align:middle line:90%
of the great year, right?

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:90%
The bull is obviously Taurus.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:90%
The lion is obviously Leo.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:90%
The angel is Aquarius.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And the eagle is Aquila,
the constellation the ego

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that rises with the
scorpion and is often

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
considered to be the celestial
counterpart of Scorpio,

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
of which Scorpio is the
terrestrial counterpart,

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
the positive and the
negative polarity of it.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But it represents, as a
symbol of time, the eagle

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
represents that same
moment, that same time

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:90%
during the course of the year.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Roughly a 5,500-year
portion of the cycle.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:08.619 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well, actually
if you take the 25,920

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and think of it as the four
seasons of the great year,

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and each of those signs, Taurus,
Leo, Aquarius, and Scorpio,

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%
they are the fixed signs.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And each of the
fixed signs is taken

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
to represent its seasonal
counterpart, right?

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So Taurus is a symbol that
represents spring, right?

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Leo represents summer
and so on, but likewise

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:90%
within the great year.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So in the great
year model, there

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
is 12 months of the year,
symbolized by the 12 signs.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are four
seasons, symbolized

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
by the bull, the lion,
the eagle, and the angel,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
or in some cases a
humanoid figure, right?

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you divide the 25,920
to get the four seasons,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.600 align:middle line:84%
each comprised of three months,
or you multiply the three

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:84%
months, which are
each 2,160, you

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:90%
get 6,480 years for each one.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Now that's interesting, because
in our previous discussion,

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.950 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
the platonic solids.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:10%
The degree measure
of the dodecahedron,

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:10%
which Plato conceived of as a
model of the universe, there

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:10%
are 12 pentagonal faces.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Each of those faces, the sides
intersect at 108 degrees.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:10%
There are five vertices,
so it's 540 per face times

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:10%
12 gives you 6,480 degrees,
measures the dodecahedron,

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.701 align:middle line:10%
and 6,480 years measures
the duration of one season

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:10%
of the great year.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A quarter
of the great year.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.463 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: A quarter
of the great year, yes.

00:18:43.463 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I have
been doing is going

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:84%
through hundreds and hundreds
of scientific articles,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:84%
going back 50 years, more
than that, going back really

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:84%
even to the turn of the century
but accelerating as we get up

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:84%
to the '70s and the '80s,
'90s as dating becomes better,

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the events that I
think of as the discontinuities

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.480 align:middle line:84%
within the uniform
change, the event nodes,

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and plotting those.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And what we see
happening or what

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I have seen happening in
that is that they cluster.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, I suspect that as
we refine our dating,

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that clustering is
going to tighten up.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to see is that there

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:84%
was major global change at
13,000 years ago, right?

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
major-- not as profound,

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.880 align:middle line:84%
but there was major global
change around 6,500 years ago.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to
the age of Scorpio,

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:84%
for example, what we
find is that is what's

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:50.320 align:middle line:84%
considered what they call the
LGM, the Late Glacial Maximum.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was during that
Age of Scorpio-- now,

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
the scientists, of course,
don't use that terminology,

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
but within the astronomical
or astrological sense,

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
the Age of Scorpio would
be that period roughly

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:90%
bracketing 18,000 years ago.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And during that
time, the planet went

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:84%
into this extreme deep
freeze, extremely cold,

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just bitterly cold.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And the glaciers
worldwide expanded

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:90%
to this enormous extent.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Roughly 6,000 years later,
come about 13,000 years,

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:84%
what we find happening
is that there's

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:84%
a succession of extreme warming
spasms, which up to this

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:38.060 align:middle line:84%
point the cause of
which is unidentified.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's clearly happened.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And this can be documented by
multiple lines of evidence.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Marine geologists
and oceanographers

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:84%
have looked at the
rise of sea level

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the last
ice age and realized

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
that unlike what we thought
40, 50 years ago, that

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
would have been a nice smooth
rise over tens of thousands

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
of years, there were these
abrupt episodes of what

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:07.419 align:middle line:84%
they call CREs,
Catastrophic Rise Events.

00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:08.835 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
major ones that

00:21:08.835 --> 00:21:11.168 align:middle line:84%
have now been identified that
are called meltwater pulse

00:21:11.168 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:90%
1a, meltwater pulse 1b.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is that
superimposed upon what we would

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.135 align:middle line:84%
think of as the
smooth curve, there

00:21:19.135 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
are these two huge
spikes of meltwater.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order to convert
glacial ice into meltwater

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:90%
takes energy.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
In the early '70s,
a team of scientists

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.220 align:middle line:90%
held at a conference.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in 1972 or '73.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of the leading
glaciologists

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.308 align:middle line:84%
and climatologists of the
day held this conference.

00:21:42.308 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, radiocarbon dating was
invented in the early '50s

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:90%
by Walter Libby.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.030 align:middle line:84%
20 years later,
they had accumulated

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:84%
enough of these
radiocarbon dates

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:84%
that they were now
being able to create

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:90%
these models of climate change.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:84%
The previous idea of
this was that the ice age

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:84%
had been this affair that
took 100,000 years to come on,

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:90%
100,000 to disappear.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
But now, they're suddenly
realizing it's only

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.840 align:middle line:90%
a fraction of that time, see?

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So what became
apparent by the early

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:84%
'70s was that 18,000
years ago, from 18,000,

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
say, to 15,000
years ago, you had

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
somewhere around 6 million
cubic miles of glacial ice

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
piled up over North America,
Northwestern Europe.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica was probably
substantially bigger

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:90%
than it is now.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And then 5,000 or 6,000
years later, it's gone.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The ice is gone?

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: The ice is gone.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
that comes back

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:90%
into Graham Hancock's work.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.835 align:middle line:84%
And now you have a vegetation
showing in Antarctica.

00:22:56.835 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:10%
And one of the thing that Graham
Hancock has been focusing us on

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:10%
is what's called
the Younger Dryas.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:10%
Younger Dryas was
this spell that

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:12.470 align:middle line:10%
lasted about 1,300 years from
about, say, 12,900 years ago

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:10%
to about 11,600, right in there.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the
scenario as it is now

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
coming based upon the
cutting-edge evidence,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
is that between 18,000 and
15,000 years ago, you've

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
got this full-blown ice
age, over-- all of Canada

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is buried under an ice sheet,
where major cities are now,

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
like New York, Boston,
Philadelphia, Chicago,

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:84%
the Twin Cities,
Detroit, Seattle.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
All of those, the ice is
thousands of feet thick.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And when people start
thinking in geological terms,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
they think, OK,
millions of years

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, we're
talking 13,000 years ago,

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.646 align:middle line:84%
which is not long at all
in the geological sense.

00:23:55.646 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what happened over
that 1,300-year period of time?

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well,
here's what happened.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere between 15,000
and 13,000 years ago,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.550 align:middle line:90%
the ice began to shrink.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And it began to disappear.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.240 align:middle line:90%
And sea levels started rising.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And during that 2,000
years, the pace of change

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:84%
would have been sort of what
one would have expected based

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:84%
upon our observations of modern
glacial recession in the wake

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
of the Little Ice Age, which
lasted from about 1,400 years

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.442 align:middle line:90%
AD to about 1850 AD.

00:24:30.442 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And we should come back to
that, because this is important.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
The Little Ice Age was an
analog for the Great Ice Age.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And the Little Ice
Age was a period

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that essentially the planet
cooled and was colder than it

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:90%
had been in 10,000 years.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And the glaciers worldwide,
while they weren't anywhere

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:84%
near what they were
during the Great Ice Age,

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:84%
were bigger during
the Little Ice Age,

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:84%
again, than they had
been in 10,000 years.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's important when we
look at modern climate change

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:05.720 align:middle line:84%
to understand that our baseline
is the end of the Little Ice

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Age, right?

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, now from
that, what we see is

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:84%
that the ice that
had grown-- there

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:84%
were whole villages,
like in the Swiss Alps,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
for example, that
got swallowed up

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:84%
by the growth of the glaciers
during the Little Ice

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Age, villages that
had to be abandoned.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
paintings and sketches

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and artists' depictions from
the 1700s and 1800s showing

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:84%
these massive glaciers
growing out of the mountains

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:84%
down into the valleys and
overrunning farms and so on.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, with the end of the
Little Ice Age around 1820 1850,

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:84%
these glaciers start
shrinking back.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a result of
the shrinking back,

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:90%
many of the rivers got swollen.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
There were proglacial lakes
that broke through and created

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
some pretty significant
floods, but not

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:84%
anywhere remotely close to what
we saw at the end of the Great

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Ice Age.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But the models of glacier
recession that were in place

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:84%
were derived from what we had
seen from the Little Ice Age,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:90%
the glaciers shrinking back.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:90%
And so then here's what happens.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:84%
At 15,000 years ago,
the great ice sheets

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:90%
start shrinking back.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.459 align:middle line:84%
At 13,000 years ago, something
interrupts that process.

00:26:21.459 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, is
this something that

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.046 align:middle line:84%
is showing in the carbon dating
that you were talking about?

00:26:26.046 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, from
the '70s, all right.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: It's showing up in
oxygen isotope analysis, which

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:84%
is a proxy for temperature
change, the ratio of oxygen

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:84%
18 to oxygen 16, and I won't
necessarily get into that,

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.116 align:middle line:84%
but somebody can do
the research if they're

00:26:43.116 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:84%
interested in finding
out how it works.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But during an ice age,
the heavier oxygen

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:84%
is preferentially left
behind in the ocean water,

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's the lighter oxygen
that's evaporated and gets

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:90%
precipitated in snowfall.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And also, in the oceans itself
when the carbonate shell

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.700 align:middle line:84%
bearing creatures create their
shells out of ocean water,

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
the ocean water carries the
imprint of that oxygen 18,

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:90%
oxygen 16 ratio.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So from there,
scientists can now just

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:84%
discern major temperature
changes, right?

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, two things now happen.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:21.010 align:middle line:84%
In the early '70s, once they
realized that the ice mostly

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.644 align:middle line:84%
was gone in less,
day, than 7,000 years,

00:27:23.644 --> 00:27:25.060 align:middle line:84%
which is what they
were assuming--

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rather than
millions of years.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Or hundreds
of thousands of years.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hundreds
of thousands, yes.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right, right.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.670 align:middle line:84%
They were faced
with a conundrum.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was this.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:84%
In order to melt ice, it
takes heat energy, right?

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:10%
And what they concluded was
that the amount of recession--

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.220 align:middle line:10%
OK, if you've got this
huge ice mass that

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.374 align:middle line:10%
covers half of North
America, and you're

00:27:48.374 --> 00:27:50.040 align:middle line:10%
going to get rid of
it, and let's assume

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:10%
it starts melting
back, just like we

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:10%
saw glaciers melting back
during the Little Ice Age,

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:10%
what they realized was that
roughly 800 feet of ice

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:05.180 align:middle line:10%
had to melt back every year
nonstop for 5,000 years.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And they calculated the amount
of energy needed to do that.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And for the
physicists out there,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:84%
we say it's 360 kilocalories
per square centimeter per year.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, well,
what's available in Canada

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:84%
now where there is no
gigantic ice cap, right?

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Just like we're seeing this
snowfall outside right now,

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
but come warm weather,
that snowfall melts.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't accumulate
as glacial ice, does it?

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So here's what they
were confronted with.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
What's available in Canada
right now to melt ice

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:47.640 align:middle line:84%
was only a fraction
of 360 kilocalories

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:90%
per square centimeter per year.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, they looked around,
and they said, well,

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.255 align:middle line:90%
what's available on Earth today?

00:28:56.255 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:84%
They looked at tropical
oceans and they

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.500 align:middle line:90%
looked at African deserts.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, what's
available in African deserts

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.090 align:middle line:90%
to melt?

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:84%
How much heat
energy is available?

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And it worked out to be
about 250 kilocalories

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:90%
per square centimeter per year.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.367 align:middle line:84%
So African deserts
were only about 2/3

00:29:15.367 --> 00:29:16.825 align:middle line:84%
of the amount of
energy available--

00:29:16.825 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would be
required to melt at that rate.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.911 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: You got it, exactly.

00:29:19.911 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And now, the heat of an African
desert applied to the ice cap

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
directly for 5,000, 6,000 years,
so what they came up with was

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
they called it the
energy paradox.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.292 align:middle line:84%
And they struggled with
it for three years.

00:29:36.292 --> 00:29:37.750 align:middle line:84%
There's another
conference, I think

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.712 align:middle line:84%
it was in 1975 or '76,
where they've come back

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:41.920 align:middle line:90%
and they're addressing again.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And they give up, and
they said basically, there

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
must be an error in
the data somewhere.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:84%
We'll put it on the
shelf and get back

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:90%
to it, which they haven't done.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.630 align:middle line:84%
But in the interim, of course,
the actual amount of time,

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.240 align:middle line:84%
nobody had identified
catastrophic rise events

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.190 align:middle line:90%
at that point, you see.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, fast forward 20
years to the early '90s,

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and we have two expeditions to
Greenland, one European, one

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:08.960 align:middle line:90%
American.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Over five seasons,
they extracted cores

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:84%
at the summit of the
Greenland ice sheet

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.765 align:middle line:90%
all the way down to bedrock.

00:30:16.765 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
They pull out those
cores, and they

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:84%
can look at the year-by-year
layering of glacial ice.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they can analyze the
constituents of those layers.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's the dust content,
the gaseous content

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:90%
in entrained air bubbles.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the oxygen isotope content.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And from that, they can
discern a lot of things

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:43.170 align:middle line:84%
about the ambient climate,
just like dendrochronologists

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:84%
can look at tree rings and can
discern, extract information

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.484 align:middle line:90%
about the ambient climate.

00:30:49.484 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Was there a lot
of rain that year,

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:90%
was there a drought, et cetera?

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
What they realized was that
there were two enormous warming

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:84%
spikes bracketing this
Younger Dryas period.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
The first one seemed
to be the most intense.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And they dated it at
somewhere between like 13,000

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.260 align:middle line:90%
to 14,000 years ago.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so picture now, the glaciers
start receding normally.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:84%
This could be the result
of the changing geometries

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.640 align:middle line:84%
between the Earth
and the sun, what are

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:90%
called the Milankovitch forces.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Because through the
changing geometries

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and the sun,
it changes the amount

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:84%
of incidental solar
radiation that

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
reaches the surface
of the Earth, right?

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.230 align:middle line:84%
If you increase the amount
of solar radiation somewhat,

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:84%
the glaciers are
going to shrink.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
If you decrease the
amount of solar radiation,

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.016 align:middle line:84%
glaciers are going
to expand, right?

00:31:46.016 --> 00:31:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, so everything looks good.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.170 align:middle line:90%
It looks normal, right?

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
15,000 to 13,000 years ago
the glaciers start shrinking,

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:84%
but then 13,000 years ago
that nice leisurely pace

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:84%
is interrupted by this
massive spasm of warming

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and concomitant
melting of the ice

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.645 align:middle line:84%
and the first catastrophic
rise in sea level that

00:32:09.645 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
is now being documented by
the marine geologists, right?

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is the
climate of the planet shifts

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.320 align:middle line:84%
back into full glacial
mode equivalent to what

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.280 align:middle line:90%
it had been 18,000 years ago.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:31.380 align:middle line:84%
For 1,300 years, it's in full,
deep, bitter glacial cold.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And then at 11,600
years ago, there's

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:84%
a second massive warming
spike, a meltwater pulse 1b,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and in that interval
between those two

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.165 align:middle line:84%
that all the great mega
fauna, the woolly mammoths,

00:32:45.165 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle line:84%
the saber tooth cats, the giant
ground sloths, the cave bears,

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.800 align:middle line:84%
120 roughly species
of giant mega mammal,

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
they all went extinct
within that window.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So the prevailing theory has
been for the last roughly half

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
century that Paleo-Indian
hunters were somehow

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.930 align:middle line:84%
responsible, which I think
is a personally and utterly

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:90%
ludicrous idea.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence
is now beginning

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:18.160 align:middle line:84%
to emerge that the culture that
proceeded the event of 13,000

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.890 align:middle line:84%
years ago, which is
called Clovis Culture,

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:22.980 align:middle line:84%
underwent a near
extinction event as

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:27.050 align:middle line:84%
well, that the whole Clovis
culture culture collapsed.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And those lines of evidence
that are converging

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:84%
are based on radiocarbon dating
of prevalent cultural activity

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.570 align:middle line:84%
in the horizons below
13,000 years ago,

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and then it ends,
rock quarries that

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.140 align:middle line:84%
had been quarried for
centuries that are now suddenly

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:51.140 align:middle line:84%
abandoned, mythic assemblages,
which are the spear points

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and tool kits and
so forth that are

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
abundant within the
stratigraphic record,

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and then at 13,000 years
ago, they disappear.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing is
showing up now in Europe

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:06.750 align:middle line:84%
as well, which is suggesting
that the human species may have

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:90%
come very close to extinction.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:84%
We know that a lot of the great
mammals did become extinct.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.120 align:middle line:84%
As far as I know, no one
has seen a woolly mammoth

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:90%
lately except in a museum.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this also overlays
with Plato's description

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.250 align:middle line:90%
of the ages when Atlantis--

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Very good, yes.

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Plato's places the
seismic event that

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:84%
sunk Atlantis at
9,000 years prior

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:90%
to Solon's exile in Egypt.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, Solon's exile in Egypt
took place right at 600 BC,

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.070 align:middle line:90%
or 2,600 years ago.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:49.510 align:middle line:84%
2,600 plus 9,000
brings us to 11,600.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, coincidence
that Plato's date

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.730 align:middle line:84%
exactly coincides with
what hard science has now

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:58.810 align:middle line:84%
identified as being a major
climatic event that involved

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:84%
a massive spike of
warming, a massive melting

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.699 align:middle line:84%
event and a rapid
sea-level rise?

00:35:03.699 --> 00:35:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would say
it's not coincidence.

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, hardly.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:07.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let me ask.

00:35:07.345 --> 00:35:10.950 align:middle line:84%
You're going back to the
carbon core samplings.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Are they able to measure the
solar radiation at all in that?

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Yes, through
beryllium deposits,

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.827 align:middle line:84%
and that is something that I'm
only now beginning to explore.

00:35:23.827 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
that seems like that

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.618 align:middle line:90%
would be a really key factor.

00:35:26.618 --> 00:35:28.956 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes, yes, yes.

00:35:28.956 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
that's something

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.000 align:middle line:84%
that I'm only now
beginning to explore.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be a
growing mass of evidence

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.002 align:middle line:90%
that yes, is showing.

00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:38.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Should be solar blast.

00:35:38.335 --> 00:35:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Again,
solar variability.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:46.830 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
in 2007 Richard Firestone

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and his colleagues at
Lawrence Livermore laboratory

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.210 align:middle line:84%
discovered that--
now, archaeologists

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that had been looking
at these Clovis sites

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.130 align:middle line:84%
had identified over
50 Clovis sites

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:84%
around North America
and even some in Europe.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:06.230 align:middle line:84%
The culture that seems to be
very consistent with the North

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:09.890 align:middle line:84%
American Clovis was
called the Solutrean, OK?

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:14.570 align:middle line:84%
They had very almost identical
tool kits, cultural norms,

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:16.150 align:middle line:90%
life ways, and so on.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:20.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, at the horizon where the
Clovis culture disappears

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and where the great
mega mammals disappear

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.050 align:middle line:84%
from the stratigraphic record,
there's quite frequently

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.410 align:middle line:90%
a black carbonaceous layer.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:33.260 align:middle line:84%
They refer to it as the
black mat layer, right?

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.630 align:middle line:90%
It's black.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The carbonaceous content is
primarily because of soot.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.035 align:middle line:90%
Soot would imply what?

00:36:40.035 --> 00:36:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An eruption
of some kind.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well,
fire, things burning.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what it implies
is the burning biomass.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what it would
imply, forest fires,

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.480 align:middle line:90%
things burning up.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Volcanic eruptions will
create layers of ash.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there
are layers of ash.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's most likely
the result of the fact

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:09.680 align:middle line:84%
that when you take 6 million
cubic miles of ice piled up

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.180 align:middle line:84%
on the North American continent,
over the center that ice mass,

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.340 align:middle line:90%
it's two miles thick.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.595 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really
hard to imagine.

00:37:17.595 --> 00:37:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Over 10,000
feet thick, yeah.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Over
10,000 feet thick.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.870 align:middle line:84%
That tremendous weight
literally crushes

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.980 align:middle line:84%
the crust of the earth
down into the mantle,

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.360 align:middle line:84%
maybe as much as a
couple thousand feet.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.560 align:middle line:84%
When that ice is
released, it springs back.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.900 align:middle line:84%
That's called
isostatic rebound, OK?

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.730 align:middle line:84%
The crust begins to come back
in this isostatic rebound.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.400 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
you're removing

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.260 align:middle line:84%
all of this mass
from the continent.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.330 align:middle line:84%
You're putting it back
into the ocean basins.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:52.780 align:middle line:84%
That causes
isostatic depression.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So what you basically have going
on with this rapid deglaciation

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:02.799 align:middle line:84%
is an enormous mass transfer
on the crust of the earth.

00:38:02.799 --> 00:38:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Clearly there are going to
be two consequences of that,

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:07.116 align:middle line:84%
both of which are
being well documented--

00:38:07.116 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:84%
intense seismicity,
earthquakes--

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
crust displacement.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Crust
displacement, volcanism.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And both of those are
being documented as being,

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I think, clearly secondary
consequences of this phenomena.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, OK.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.392 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to
continue on that?

00:38:25.392 --> 00:38:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Insert something
if you've got a question.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm going
to ask a question now.

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So with everything we talked
about in our last conversation,

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.570 align:middle line:84%
with evidence left behind
by ancient cultures

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:84%
in a universal language of
geometry, form, numbers,

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:42.700 align:middle line:84%
letters, et cetera,
where is this indicated?

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
kind of steer you

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.884 align:middle line:84%
towards some of the stories,
the least likely stories

00:38:47.884 --> 00:38:50.050 align:middle line:84%
that we would hear, even
in the form the fairy tales

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and such, that might
embed this information.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And also let's talk
about our deep-seated

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.787 align:middle line:84%
fear of annihilation and our
memory loss after this period.

00:39:01.787 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Starting
with that, I think

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.130 align:middle line:84%
it's clear that
once we recognize

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:84%
the reality of these
kinds of events,

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:13.050 align:middle line:84%
in contrast to what we were
taught as schoolchildren

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.950 align:middle line:84%
about the history of the
Earth, which was basically

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:22.020 align:middle line:84%
a strict uniformity-- we
were taught, I was taught,

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and most of us
were, to the extent

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that we were made familiar
with Earth history

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.307 align:middle line:84%
that geological change
happens one grain of sand

00:39:29.307 --> 00:39:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and one drop of water at a time.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's orderly.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.080 align:middle line:90%
It's slow.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.455 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And over millions
of years, it can accumulate.

00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:35.900 align:middle line:90%
And this is certainly true.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Yes, over millions of
years, change accumulates,

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.990 align:middle line:90%
yes, pretty remarkably, too.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
However, what they were not
aware of and that we now know

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.750 align:middle line:84%
is it that that orderly
pace of gradualistic change

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:53.260 align:middle line:84%
is punctuated by these
catastrophic events.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I call them points
of discontinuity,

00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:84%
the non-linear phases within
that continuum of change.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's those, and the fact
that-- well, consider now

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:84%
in the last 200,000
years, there may

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.850 align:middle line:84%
have been four full
interglacial cycles

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.200 align:middle line:90%
that have come and gone, right?

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those could
have been very catastrophic.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we now
know, documenting

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.840 align:middle line:84%
going over the last couple
hundred thousand years,

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.090 align:middle line:84%
there have been a
dozen or more episodes,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:33.050 align:middle line:84%
which, were they to occur
today, would seriously

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:37.820 align:middle line:84%
stress modern civilization, if
not eliminate it altogether,

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.690 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily cause the
extinction of human beings,

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:44.107 align:middle line:84%
but basically cause the global
collapse of civilization.

00:40:44.107 --> 00:40:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With a few
human beings scrambling

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.020 align:middle line:90%
to caves for a while.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Exactly, exactly.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, the
anthropological evidence

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.500 align:middle line:84%
shows us that
modern humans, just

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.300 align:middle line:84%
like us, with the
same intelligence,

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.550 align:middle line:84%
have been around-- and this
is a conservative number--

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.830 align:middle line:84%
between 150,000
and 180,000 years.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going just on
the hard evidence of--

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
Michael Cremo's work,

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.110 align:middle line:84%
for example, would take it
back to millions of years.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Right, and
most anthropologists

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.870 align:middle line:90%
are going to dispute that.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: But we don't need
to go there to make the point.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Even if we go back
180,000 years,

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and we have modern skeletons
now that have been found,

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.470 align:middle line:84%
documented, and dated
at 180,000 years.

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:27.490 align:middle line:84%
If we think of a human
generation as being 25 years,

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that's 7,000 generations
of humans, right?

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, in 180,000
years, like I said,

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.140 align:middle line:84%
there has been probably
a dozen or more events,

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.440 align:middle line:84%
which if they were
to recur today,

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.400 align:middle line:84%
could cause mass mortality,
serious stressing

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.310 align:middle line:84%
of modern civilization, even
to the point of extinction

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:51.790 align:middle line:84%
of modern civilization,
basically pulling the plug.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Because modern civilization is
now so interconnected, right?

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:59.840 align:middle line:84%
If we have a Katrina, as
an example, that wipes out

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.950 align:middle line:84%
a large part of one city,
that's only one small part

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.830 align:middle line:84%
of the intact
infrastructure, right?

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:84%
If we go an order of
magnitude above that

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.509 align:middle line:84%
and say we wipe out
10 major cities,

00:42:11.509 --> 00:42:13.050 align:middle line:84%
well, we're going
to recover from it,

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to cause
serious economic ripples,

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:84%
global economic
ripples that could

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.280 align:middle line:84%
take a decade or
two to recover from.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.930 align:middle line:84%
If we go two orders
of magnitude,

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:28.200 align:middle line:84%
now we're hovering on the
brink of global civilization

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.480 align:middle line:90%
collapse.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Three orders of
magnitude, we're gone.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Civilization is
over as we know it.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, events can
be documented that

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.020 align:middle line:90%
have occurred on that scale.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say
you've constructed a timeline.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes, I did.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With these
various events.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes, I did.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and then
you show this little spot

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.840 align:middle line:84%
at then end that
brings us up to now.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And there seems to be a tempo.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.610 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem like these
things are just distributed

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.230 align:middle line:90%
randomly through time.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.560 align:middle line:84%
It appears that there is
a tempo to these things.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can I read
your quote on this?

00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:59.625 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Please do.

00:42:59.625 --> 00:43:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "A cosmic tempo
based on sacred geometry,

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:84%
encoded in myths and
mystical architecture

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:08.670 align:middle line:84%
throughout the Earth, governs
the unfolding of world ages,

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.510 align:middle line:84%
the rise and fall
of civilizations,

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:15.531 align:middle line:84%
and is ultimately the very
basis of apocalyptic prophecy."

00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.596 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Did I say that?

00:43:17.596 --> 00:43:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you said that.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about where it's buried

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and where it's hiding
in plain sight.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.690 align:middle line:84%
You talked about
the one in Chartres,

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:84%
the information that was
embedded there in these four

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.860 align:middle line:90%
distinct 5,600-year cycles.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Yes, and
that same depiction

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:84%
is portrayed on
dozens of cathedrals.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:41.840 align:middle line:84%
It's as if that Gothic building
age was inaugurated in order

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:48.520 align:middle line:84%
to bring forward things that had
been classified, if you will,

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.800 align:middle line:90%
and put them out there.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
information that's

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:84%
encoded in those cathedrals,
and just like Victor Hugo said,

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.090 align:middle line:90%
there are textbooks in stone.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.940 align:middle line:84%
The information
that's encoded there

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:84%
was really intended not for
1200 1300 AD, but for 2100 AD.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, to help
us regain, A, some memory,

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and give us a heads up.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, salient example--
Sphinx in Egypt,

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:22.249 align:middle line:84%
which is now quite well known
among alternative historians.

00:44:22.249 --> 00:44:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Robert Schoch's work.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Robert Schoch,
John Anthony West, yeah,

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.570 align:middle line:90%
going back to--

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: John Anthony West
will go way further out

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:29.900 align:middle line:84%
on a limb than Robert
Schoch, though.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Oh, yeah, he
doesn't have anything to lose.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.796 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch is a tenured
professor at Boston,

00:44:33.796 --> 00:44:35.670 align:middle line:84%
so he's got to play it
a little conservative.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:36.919 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very conservatively.

00:44:36.919 --> 00:44:38.620 align:middle line:84%
But not John Anthony
West, and if you

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.184 align:middle line:84%
go into ancient doctrines,
it's way further out than that.

00:44:41.184 --> 00:44:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Sphinx
itself, if we look

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:48.610 align:middle line:84%
at the composite-- and
this suggests to me

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that we can look at all
of the composite animals

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:53.480 align:middle line:84%
from mythology in an
astronomical sense.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Sphinx is a lion
and a man, right?

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.850 align:middle line:84%
What does that suggest
within the zodiacal wheel?

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius and Leo, this
axis that we're basically

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.780 align:middle line:90%
transiting right now.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.730 align:middle line:84%
As the vernal equinox is moving
in the next few centuries,

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.260 align:middle line:84%
over that point in the
zodiacal wheel where

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:18.460 align:middle line:84%
we're looking across that great
cosmic circle at the other side

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:22.080 align:middle line:84%
of that axis, and we see
that right there, boom,

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.910 align:middle line:84%
the hammer came down and
something really, really

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.960 align:middle line:90%
intense happen to this planet.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.600 align:middle line:90%
And it was intense.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.900 align:middle line:84%
As a barometer of
its intensity, we

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.510 align:middle line:84%
can look at the loss of
species that occurred.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Because loss of species
is a direct indication

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:40.440 align:middle line:90%
of loss of habitat, right?

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The mass extinction
that occurred

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the last ice age
is the greatest mass extinction

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.980 align:middle line:84%
that has occurred on this
planet in 5 million years.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Basically what we had was
the mega mammals, which

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:54.560 align:middle line:84%
are defined as any animal
over about 44 kilograms

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.410 align:middle line:84%
or 100 pounds in body weight,
is defined as a mega mammal.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.547 align:middle line:10%
Roughly 120, depending on
how you define the species,

00:46:02.547 --> 00:46:04.630 align:middle line:10%
and there's a little bit
of difference of opinion,

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:09.720 align:middle line:10%
but roughly 120 species met
their demise in that window,

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.790 align:middle line:10%
the Younger Dryas window, that
transition out of the ice age,

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.450 align:middle line:10%
which what a
geologist would call

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:10%
the Pleistocene-Holocene
transition, right?

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the number of mega
mammal species on Earth

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.170 align:middle line:90%
today is about that same number.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:30.220 align:middle line:84%
If we go back into the depths
of the ice age and then back

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.570 align:middle line:84%
from there, tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.630 align:middle line:84%
of years, for example,
in North America,

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:84%
there were more large mammals
living in North America

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.987 align:middle line:84%
than there are in the
Serengeti Plain today.

00:46:39.987 --> 00:46:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, elephants.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, there were
four species of proboscideans,

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.390 align:middle line:90%
or elephants-- four.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's amazing
when you think about it.

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:54.736 align:middle line:84%
The American Pleistocene lion,
which roamed around-- that

00:46:54.736 --> 00:46:55.860 align:middle line:90%
would have been right here.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I think they've found
specimens in Colorado.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.690 align:middle line:84%
It was nearly the size
of a horse, right?

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.820 align:middle line:84%
The saber-toothed cat,
which everybody knows about.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we see these
depicted symbolically

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.900 align:middle line:84%
in myths and such and think,
wow, what an imagination.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Yeah,
Graham just recently

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.330 align:middle line:84%
emailed me a link
to what appears

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:22.280 align:middle line:84%
to be a Stonehenge-like
structure 40

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:84%
feet below the surface
of Lake Michigan.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And on one of the stones-- and
the photographs I've seen now

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.910 align:middle line:84%
are fairly grainy--
but still, on one

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.580 align:middle line:84%
of the stores it looks like
what is etched into the stone

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.460 align:middle line:90%
is a carving of a mastodon.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, as it turns out,
there is a period

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.000 align:middle line:84%
between 6,000 and
9,000 years ago

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.550 align:middle line:84%
where Lake Michigan was perhaps
as much as 300 feet lower

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:46.500 align:middle line:90%
than now.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So this area where this thing
is built was actually exposed,

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.380 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, exposed
to the atmosphere

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.335 align:middle line:90%
for about 3,000 years.

00:47:56.335 --> 00:48:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And somebody apparently built
a Stonehenge-like structure

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:01.045 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:02.170 align:middle line:90%
This hasn't been confirmed.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:02.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:48:02.785 --> 00:48:04.701 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, it
hasn't been confirmed yet.

00:48:04.701 --> 00:48:07.286 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting to see what
subsequent research discloses.

00:48:07.286 --> 00:48:08.660 align:middle line:84%
But on one of the
stones, there's

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.820 align:middle line:90%
what appears to be a mastodon.

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as I know, no
mastadons in North America

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:18.420 align:middle line:84%
survived later than about
11,000 or 11,600 years ago.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So it could be just
a vestigial memory,

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:25.510 align:middle line:84%
trying to preserve the
memory of the creatures.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.949 align:middle line:84%
There was some
traditions, and I've

00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:30.490 align:middle line:84%
forgotten where the
source of it was,

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to imply that
perhaps mastadons might have

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.290 align:middle line:84%
even been domesticated
to some extent,

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:38.800 align:middle line:84%
like modern elephants, which
I find extremely fascinating.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, what we had was
we had profound global changes

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.090 align:middle line:84%
that terminated the
2-million-year-plus period

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:53.020 align:middle line:84%
of the Pleistocene and
inaugurated the Holocene,

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.850 align:middle line:84%
which is the modern geological
epoch that we've been in.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And its inception is usually
given now in the textbooks

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.430 align:middle line:90%
as 11,600 years ago.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's associated with a
rapid melting of the ice,

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.590 align:middle line:84%
sudden rise in sea
level, and that's

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:12.930 align:middle line:84%
when, by coincidence, Plato
says Atlantis was drowned.

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, you remember what
I said about isostatcy,

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:18.280 align:middle line:84%
this vertical movement
of the Earth's crust?

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.990 align:middle line:84%
If you're rapidly dumping
hundreds of feet of ocean water

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:26.747 align:middle line:84%
into the ocean basins where
the crust is the thinnest,

00:49:26.747 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:84%
what do you think is going
to happen to the ocean bottom

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to compensate for this
additional weight?

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:32.510 align:middle line:90%
It's going to sink.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:33.880 align:middle line:90%
It's going to subside.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.021 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
pseudoscientific about assuming

00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:38.520 align:middle line:84%
that there could
have been an island

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.610 align:middle line:84%
complex in the
mid-Atlantic right

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:44.240 align:middle line:84%
where Plato placed it,
that could have sunk.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Nothing pseudoscientific
about that.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, not
at all, and there

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.710 align:middle line:84%
are people such as Edgar
Cayce, for example,

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:54.990 align:middle line:84%
who gave their renderings in
more modern history, who also

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:58.980 align:middle line:84%
said that within a period
close to our lifetimes,

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:03.590 align:middle line:84%
we would start seeing the
rise of that continent again,

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:06.690 align:middle line:84%
meaning there has to be some
kind of serious activity

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:07.900 align:middle line:90%
going on for that to happen.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.245 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: He might have
meant that metaphorically.

00:50:10.245 --> 00:50:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Either way, even if
was metaphorically--

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:17.016 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it was
literally, but yeah, go ahead.

00:50:17.016 --> 00:50:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well, in the
sense that, yeah, Atlantis

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.940 align:middle line:84%
is going to rise
again in the sense

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:23.420 align:middle line:84%
that we're now in
a position where

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:27.240 align:middle line:84%
we can actually scientifically
verify Plato's account.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And Plato's account
is very detailed

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:33.100 align:middle line:84%
in terms of its geography
and its geology and so on.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you go through,
like I have done,

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.430 align:middle line:84%
line by line by line,
what you'll find

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:41.860 align:middle line:84%
is that it all syncs up with
what we now know about geology.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And there is hard
scientific evidence

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:46.510 align:middle line:84%
that along the
mid-Atlantic Ridge

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:50.150 align:middle line:84%
there is a sunken, what they
call a microcontinent, which

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:54.460 align:middle line:84%
is just about the size that
Plato described for Atlantis.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And its there, and it has a
great mountain range on it,

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.160 align:middle line:90%
just like Plato described.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And the tips of those mountains
are the Azores Islands,

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.290 align:middle line:90%
which is where--

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Mount Pico is supposed
to be the remnant of it,

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.460 align:middle line:90%
and it still remains visible.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:07.960 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:08.668 align:middle line:90%
You can go to it.

00:51:08.668 --> 00:51:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes, yes.

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:15.620 align:middle line:84%
The 400-foot rise in sea level,
post-glacial 400-foot rise

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:20.895 align:middle line:84%
in sea level, roughly
reduce those islands to 50%.

00:51:20.895 --> 00:51:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But when you add and
the fact that there

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.780 align:middle line:84%
had to be isostatic
compensation that occurred

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:33.690 align:middle line:84%
in the form of the ocean
bottom literally dropping,

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and if it's comparable to
what we see the rise over--

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:38.040 align:middle line:84%
if you go up by
Hudson Bay, which

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.080 align:middle line:84%
was the center of
the great ice sheet,

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.740 align:middle line:84%
you can see shorelines
that are 1,000, 1,200.

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.360 align:middle line:90%
1,500 feet above sea level.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, you take that and
add that to the 400 feet,

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.250 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
potentially thousands

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:58.390 align:middle line:84%
of feet between sea level
change and the ocean bottom.

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, it could very well be that
when we adjust for all of that,

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that the entire microcontinent
of the Azores Plateau

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.060 align:middle line:90%
may have been above water.

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
there is documentation

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that the Gulf Stream
during the ice age

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:18.547 align:middle line:84%
diverted south just north
of the Azores plateau.

00:52:18.547 --> 00:52:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:21.463 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: So you've
got the Azores Plateau.

00:52:21.463 --> 00:52:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going way up
here by the British Isles--

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Now,
if you're looking

00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:30.584 align:middle line:84%
for prime habitable real estate
during the ice age, that might

00:52:30.584 --> 00:52:31.750 align:middle line:90%
have been a very nice place.

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Yes, exactly.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, now there's
so many streams of

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.000 align:middle line:90%
thought we can go into in this.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.660 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is
that as that was passed on,

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.660 align:middle line:84%
as you say, from Egyptian
priests in ancient times

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.060 align:middle line:84%
to Solon, Critias, down Plato
and so forth and then on

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.630 align:middle line:84%
now to us, we're getting
into a time where--

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and I referred to this earlier--
there's this mass amnesia.

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:58.940 align:middle line:84%
We're desperately seeking
clues as to our past.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And people like you and others
are finding these clues now

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that have been laid down
there for us to see,

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:06.057 align:middle line:84%
hiding in plain
sight for all of us.

00:53:06.057 --> 00:53:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Hiding in plain site.

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
this systemic fear

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.139 align:middle line:84%
of annihilation, of mass
annihilation, as a people.

00:53:13.139 --> 00:53:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Where
does that come from?

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And now people are going
through-- we talked off camera.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Psychics are beginning
to look into phenomena.

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:26.870 align:middle line:84%
The work of Dolores Cannon
and many, many other people

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.390 align:middle line:90%
have those in regressions.

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Dolores regressed
me back to the time

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:33.430 align:middle line:90%
of the destruction of Atlantis.

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:34.760 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't where
I wanted to go.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.801 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going
somewhere relatively modern

00:53:36.801 --> 00:53:37.920 align:middle line:90%
but ended up there.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, this horrid feeling
that we were losing everything

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and that we were going to
have to start over again.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
fascinating experience,

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's still a little
depressing to me.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.170 align:middle line:84%
That energy is so alive,
I get teared up a lot

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:55.227 align:middle line:90%
if I even think about it.

00:53:55.227 --> 00:53:56.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
getting teared up,

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:58.940 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know
why they're teared up.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
clues, where we are,

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and where we are
in that cycle now.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Why now?

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.570 align:middle line:90%
We're remembering now.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: If we look at
the hard scientific record,

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:12.010 align:middle line:84%
what we see is we go back a
couple hundred thousand years.

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:16.016 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that the climate
of the planet has oscillated.

00:54:16.016 --> 00:54:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And there have
been periods where

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:20.030 align:middle line:84%
the glaciers have grown
enormously and then

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.480 align:middle line:90%
rapidly shrunk away.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you can picture glaciers
growing, simultaneously

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.290 align:middle line:84%
sea levels dropping,
and as sea level drops,

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:30.680 align:middle line:84%
coastlines migrate, in some
cases hundreds of miles.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So while you're simultaneously
losing enormous swathes of land

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to the ice, you're
gaining new land

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:42.250 align:middle line:84%
as the continental shelves
are being exposed, OK?

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
surviving these events

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:49.220 align:middle line:84%
are probably, obviously,
vacating the areas

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.290 align:middle line:84%
where the ice is
amassing and migrating

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:56.320 align:middle line:84%
into these newly exposed
lands as sea level drops.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And supposedly a
lot of that happened around

00:54:58.570 --> 00:54:59.580 align:middle line:90%
the time of Atlantis.

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.150 align:middle line:90%
People went off to the Yucatan.

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:02.820 align:middle line:90%
They went to a lot of areas.

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:05.403 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Remember what I was
saying about meltwater pulse 1a

00:55:05.403 --> 00:55:06.220 align:middle line:90%
and 1b?

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.420 align:middle line:84%
That first meltwater
pulse clearly

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.070 align:middle line:84%
could have
destabilized the region

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:14.010 align:middle line:84%
along the mid-Atlantic
Ridge, causing sea level

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:20.300 align:middle line:84%
to rise, maybe 25% of its total
rise during that time, right?

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.020 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you might
find that a culture,

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.890 align:middle line:84%
a maritime culture-- and I
don't go into necessarily

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:31.520 align:middle line:84%
like crystal technologies
or flying machines,

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.130 align:middle line:90%
only because you don't need to.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that that
couldn't have existed.

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:39.265 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, but yeah,
we've talked a lot about it

00:55:39.265 --> 00:55:40.848 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of interviews,
but let's talk

00:55:40.848 --> 00:55:43.230 align:middle line:84%
about what you see when
you don't even go that fat.

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well,
what you could have

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:47.930 align:middle line:84%
seen-- I think of a modern
historical model that

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:51.080 align:middle line:84%
might have provided
an analogy from which

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.210 align:middle line:84%
we could start thinking
would be the Phoenicians.

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:56.760 align:middle line:84%
They were a very
sophisticated culture.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.180 align:middle line:84%
They had advanced
navigational skills.

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:00.680 align:middle line:90%
They were seafaring.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And what does Plato describe?

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.750 align:middle line:84%
If we go to what
Plato describes,

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:08.210 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly what he
describes, a very wealthy,

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:09.015 align:middle line:90%
seafaring culture.

00:56:09.015 --> 00:56:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Advanced culture.

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Advanced
culture that was carrying

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:12.790 align:middle line:90%
on trade, that had colonies.

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Civilization, culture.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes, OK.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, with those
changes in climate

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:23.260 align:middle line:84%
that began to occur at
the end of the ice age,

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that could have caused
enormous disruption

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to a civilization that could
have existed for 10,000 years

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:34.260 align:middle line:84%
or more on that location,
on the geographical spot

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.640 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the Earth.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
how Plato describes it.

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.750 align:middle line:84%
It had been a very
benevolent culture,

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:45.310 align:middle line:84%
very wise and not materialistic,
and then something shifted.

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just
intercultural contact

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:53.550 align:middle line:84%
with other, they
became imperialistic.

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And they went on a
campaign of conquest.

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And this led to this great
war between the Atlanteans

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and the Proto-Athenians,
who were

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.310 align:middle line:84%
the predecessors of the
Athenians of Plato's day,

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:08.910 align:middle line:90%
or at least of Solon's day.

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And there was this gigantic war,
and then the Proto-Athenians

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.150 align:middle line:84%
were able to mobilize
all of the groups

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:18.460 align:middle line:90%
within the pillars of Heracles.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And they fought
off the Atlanteans,

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.800 align:middle line:84%
drove them out back outside
the pillars of Heracles,

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and right after that was when
the event happened that caused

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:31.060 align:middle line:90%
their disappearance.

00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting, because if you

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:34.680 align:middle line:84%
go into other circle,
they'll say, well,

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.630 align:middle line:84%
it was because of the
selfish, greedy nature

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of the human beings at
that time and technology

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.330 align:middle line:84%
that they had access
to at that time.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But what you're saying is that
you don't need to go that far.

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: No, you don't
need to go that far.

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that that
wasn't an element of it.

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:50.480 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just saying--

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It may have been.

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I look back
on that one destruction--

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:54.830 align:middle line:90%
there were three destructions.

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:57.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the earlier
destructions, I believe,

00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:00.070 align:middle line:84%
you were looking at very
sophisticated technology,

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:04.090 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't being used
in a usurious, negative way

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:04.730 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It was used for
agriculture and such.

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:10.102 align:middle line:84%
But it was employed when the
Earth became destabilized.

00:58:10.102 --> 00:58:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: See,
what you're getting

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.350 align:middle line:84%
at there is very
important, because if we

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:19.580 align:middle line:84%
go to like the Greek myth of
the great flood, Deucalion

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and Pyrrha-- being sort
of a kabbalist myself,

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.130 align:middle line:84%
I always look at names
and words and what

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:29.050 align:middle line:90%
they can teach us, right?

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Deucalion basically
means two lions, right?

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Pyrrha means fire.

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Suggests-- hm, lions brings
up, invokes the idea of Leo.

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Fire, again-- well
these could be hints.

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we find these things
scattered all throughout.

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:50.280 align:middle line:84%
When the flood came, the
arc that Deucalion built

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:54.610 align:middle line:84%
rode on the flood waters for
nine days and nights, right?

00:58:54.610 --> 00:59:00.130 align:middle line:84%
When we go to the myth of the
birth of Apollo and Artemis,

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:06.000 align:middle line:84%
the mother Leto was
impregnated by Zeus, right?

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.760 align:middle line:84%
She labored for nine
days and nine nights.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.460 align:middle line:84%
You see, you find
these kinds of things.

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.030 align:middle line:90%
We were in the last discussion--

00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:14.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Allegorically they
keep repeating these numbers

00:59:14.715 --> 00:59:15.430 align:middle line:90%
and cycles, including nine.

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: There's
that number nine again.

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:17.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nine, yeah.

00:59:17.515 --> 00:59:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, nine, right?

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.062 align:middle line:84%
Well again, if you go
nine days and nine nights,

00:59:23.062 --> 00:59:24.520 align:middle line:84%
if you do the
numbers on there, you

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:27.840 align:middle line:84%
discover that it's
12,960, right?

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.070 align:middle line:84%
That number comes up, which is
that half-precessional cycle

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:34.430 align:middle line:90%
again, see?

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
it's proven, but it

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:40.890 align:middle line:84%
could be that these numbers
were deliberately encoded

00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:42.430 align:middle line:90%
to carry information forward.

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, we only
have a minute or so left.

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.569 align:middle line:90%
So where we now?

00:59:46.569 --> 00:59:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Oh, boy.

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I thought we were just
getting warmed up.

00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:49.706 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, we were.

00:59:49.706 --> 00:59:50.270 align:middle line:90%
This is fun.

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:51.574 align:middle line:90%
But you have to come back.

00:59:51.574 --> 00:59:52.990 align:middle line:84%
You have to do a
lot more of this.

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:55.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've been fascinated.

00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about, because
people are wondering, OK,

00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that's all cool, so
all the signs are there

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:02.959 align:middle line:84%
hiding in plain sight, where
are we now in that cycle?

01:00:02.959 --> 01:00:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Several
things-- I'll talk fast.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Several things are
converging here.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.680 align:middle line:84%
One, we're coming to
a new appreciation,

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.950 align:middle line:84%
recognition of the
importance of ancient myth,

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:13.760 align:middle line:84%
legend, epic stories,
and so forth,

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.330 align:middle line:84%
realizing that
these are vehicles

01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:18.600 align:middle line:84%
for transmitting profound
scientific information.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.900 align:middle line:90%
That's happening on one hand.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.980 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, geologists
are looking at the Earth

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and realizing slowly
that the Earth itself

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:33.160 align:middle line:84%
carries the imprint of cosmic
events in the form of craters

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.155 align:middle line:90%
and astroblemes.

01:00:34.155 --> 01:00:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We never even
got to comets and all that.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Didn't even
get to that, no, we didn't

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we didn't.

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:38.313 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

01:00:38.313 --> 01:00:40.724 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what you have to say
is so rich, and we're OK.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Then
on the other hand,

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
astronomers are looking
into the near-Earth space

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:47.100 align:middle line:90%
and discovering, guess what?

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.110 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone.

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, near-Earth
space is densely

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
populated with all
kinds of stuff,

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's flying by
us all the time.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
We just didn't have the
technological eyes to see it.

01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But now we're seeing that every
month, there are close calls.

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You remember what happened on
February 15, 2014, Chelyabinsk,

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Siberia?

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.760 align:middle line:90%
An object suddenly came in.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally at the same time,
the closest documented asteroid

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
flyby was happening, two
separate events but right

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:16.285 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

01:01:16.285 --> 01:01:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Are these coincidences?

01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Now to me, that was like
a little warning shot.

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Tungusta, 1908, which
we didn't talk about,

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
which needs to be talked about
because we've only just begun

01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:30.400 align:middle line:84%
to extract the mysteries
that have been conveyed

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
to the human species
by that event

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and what that had
to teach us and how

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that is consistent with
ancient traditions that

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
have come to us
through Mithraism,

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.120 align:middle line:84%
through the Mayan traditions,
through Zoroastrianism

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.210 align:middle line:90%
and what they understood.

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And why were our
ancient ancestors

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
so obsessed with the
heavens and the events

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:52.920 align:middle line:90%
in the celestial domain?

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.727 align:middle line:84%
And that would be a topic that
we should pick up on another--

01:01:55.727 --> 01:01:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:00.180 align:middle line:90%
We'll go-- yes, we will.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Just a final thought
right now for us.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.790 align:middle line:84%
People are still
waiting for the big one.

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:06.110 align:middle line:90%
What's the timing?

01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Looking roughly
within these cycles,

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:10.940 align:middle line:90%
where are we in these cycles?

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: I would say
we have enough time.

01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To do what, bake
brownies or do a few more

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.480 align:middle line:90%
generations or many more?

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: We've got-- see,
we have to get into this.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we
human species ultimately

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.304 align:middle line:84%
came from the cosmos and to
the cosmos we must return.

01:02:28.304 --> 01:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm with
you on a lot of that.

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And part of
our return to the cosmos

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
is that we create-- what we
do is we are in a position

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
now, which has perhaps
never happened before,

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
where we can be the
protectors of this planet.

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Because we're realizing
that this planet

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
now is vulnerable to a much
larger scale of phenomena.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think of all the
species on this planet,

01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I think the whatever
the wisdom of nature,

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
however you want to
think of it, whether it's

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
God or divine purpose or
just the wisdom of nature,

01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:10.260 align:middle line:84%
we evolved because
we have foresight,

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and we can piece together
these, connect the dots.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have within our hands
the power to break the cycle.

01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But only if we
become aware of it

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and only if we grow
spiritually and psychologically

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and realize that-- just
like in the book of Matthew

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
when one of the
disciples asked Jesus,

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
we can end with,

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
he said, how are we going
to know when the end of days

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:38.160 align:middle line:90%
is at hand?

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, as it
was in the days of Noah

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:43.255 align:middle line:84%
when the people were eating
and drinking and marrying

01:03:43.255 --> 01:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and giving in
marriage until the day

01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
that Noah entered the
Ark and the great flood

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
came and swept them
all away, so will it

01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
be again in the days of the
coming of the Son of Man.

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:56.540 align:middle line:10%
This is metaphorical, but what
he's saying there, I think,

01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.930 align:middle line:10%
is that if we get so
obsessed and so concerned

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:04.500 align:middle line:10%
with the trivia of day-to-day
life and forget the great plan,

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.582 align:middle line:10%
just as the Hopi Indians
said, now we open ourselves

01:04:08.582 --> 01:04:09.290 align:middle line:10%
to vulnerability.

01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:10.873 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
beautiful, going back

01:04:10.873 --> 01:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
to the Hopi legend for
these times, I think,

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:14.837 align:middle line:90%
is a very important clue.

01:04:14.837 --> 01:04:16.009 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

01:04:16.009 --> 01:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So everyone
can look that one up.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Remembering
the plan the creator,

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.660 align:middle line:90%
in the words of the Hopis.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:23.760 align:middle line:90%
On that, thank you.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.510 align:middle line:90%
We'll definitely do this again.

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
What a fascinating
ride with you.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I just loved it.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I got to sit and
listen most the time.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.525 align:middle line:90%
I could just, oh, really?

01:04:32.525 --> 01:04:33.720 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.207 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:04:35.207 --> 01:04:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Thanks for having me.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To look more
deeply into Randall's work,

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.960 align:middle line:10%
you can see one of
his many lectures

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.310 align:middle line:10%
on YouTube, as well as
going to his website,

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:43.840 align:middle line:10%
sacredgeometryinternational.com.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
