>>REGINA MEREDITH: According
to my guest, Andrew Collins,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:10%
there was a race of people who
predated all modern humans--

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:10%
the Denisovans or
Denis-oh-vans, depending

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:10%
on how you pronounce it.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:84%
They lived in southern Turkey
all the way through Siberia

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and dated back 300,000
to 400,000 years ago.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Andrew is going to
share his perspective

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:84%
on how these little-known
people made very

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:90%
little-known contributions.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We really don't understand
who these people are,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's an absolutely
fascinating story.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all, I
want to welcome you.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.254 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for coming to
London to be with us.

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW COLLINS: Thank you.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
just start out.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.079 align:middle line:90%
Who were they?

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Give us their background.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.578 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well,
we never even knew

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that they existed
until the year 2012

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
when some bones that were found
in a cave in southern Siberia

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:84%
were examined, and their DNA
tested, the genome extracted,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and we found that they
weren't us at all.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:10%
And what I mean by that
is, modern humans--

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:10%
Homo sapiens-- and they
weren't Neanderthals,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:10%
who are the precursors of modern
humans, certainly in Europe

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:10%
and parts of Asia.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:10%
They were a completely
unknown human population

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:10%
that existed down to
around 40,000 years ago.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the latest estimates.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And we certainly know
that they lived in a cave

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
in the southern Siberian
country of the Altai,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains there,
known as the Denisova cave.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:10%
It's actually named
after a hermit called

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:10%
Denis that actually
lived in that cave,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:10%
I think, in the 18th century.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:10%
But excavations have
been taking place there

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:10%
over several
decades, and they've

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:10%
come across about 22 layers
of human activity there.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:10%
But in one of them,
which was layer 11,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:10%
they found these particular
fossil remains, these bones--

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:10%
teeth--

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:10%
and this is what we now
know is the Denisovan

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:10%
layer because this is
where all of the activity

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:10%
is taking place,
and this is where

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:10%
we know that they existed.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:10%
And although we've
actually only got

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:10%
four pieces of fossil remains,
which is actually one finger

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:10%
bone and three teeth,
that can tell us a hell

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.701 align:middle line:10%
of a lot about these people.

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:10%
It can tell us, for
instance, that they're

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:10%
incredibly large because all
of the items found so far

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:10%
are of extreme size.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:10%
But more importantly,
the extraction

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.340 align:middle line:10%
of the genome in 2012
tells us so much more

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.830 align:middle line:10%
about who they were,
when they lived,

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:10%
their relationships to
ourselves and to Neanderthals,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:10%
and how far they
reached in the old world

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:10%
and into the new world.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
a large percentage

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:84%
of modern human
populations also carry

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
the genes of the Denisovans,
just in the same way

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that many people in
the Western world

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
have the genes of Neanderthals,
many people in the eastern part

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
of the world, and
in the Americas,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.220 align:middle line:90%
contain the Denisovan genes.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is quite significant
because all these genes

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
have given us
something important,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it be the ability
to exist at high altitudes--

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
this requires a particular
gene, and it's there

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
amongst the Sherpas and
Tibetans of the Himalayas--

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:84%
or indeed, the Inuit peoples
of Canada and Greenland,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:84%
they have genes relating
to bulking up so that they

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:90%
can exist in extreme cold.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Both of these genes were
given to us by the Denisovans.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what I mean by that is
that we interbred with them

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:84%
when they were still around,
probably between around 55

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:90%
and 45,000 years ago.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that interbreeding,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.680 align:middle line:84%
these genes were passed
on to human populations,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and that allowed us to subsist
and to thrive in areas that we

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.252 align:middle line:90%
couldn't previously have done.

00:04:30.252 --> 00:04:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just find this
absolutely fascinating,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:84%
the origins of this species, and
some of the problematic areas,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.374 align:middle line:84%
like you take the people
that were built to bulk up

00:04:40.374 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and then you add
McDonald's to it,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and then we're in trouble
now, in modern times, right?

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But outside of those
little glitches,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I had
been told years-- many,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, and this was
more through mystical source--

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
is that we have a
misunderstanding about

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
the, quote, "evolution
of our species"--

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:84%
that there were many, many, many
different iterations of what

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
are humans along the
way, and we've just yet

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:90%
to discover them.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's so exciting
about what you're working on,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and others right now, is this
is one of those new species.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about this notion
of the size, the size factor,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and that some of the
people in our indigenous

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.244 align:middle line:84%
regions of the world today
still carry those features.

00:05:21.244 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, all the
way around the world,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:90%
we have stories of giants.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And these
can be anything

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:90%
from 7 feet up to 12 feet.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would think that
many of these stories

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:84%
are exaggerations,
that we probably

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:84%
are talking about the
memory of human individuals,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
groups, even populations that
existed around the world that

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.540 align:middle line:84%
were of increased
size, let's say,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
both in width and
also in height.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But the trouble is,
is that up until now,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
we've had this idea of almost
like a fairy story book

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
view of giants, like
"Jack and the Beanstalk"

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:84%
or something like this,
and we haven't really

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:90%
taken it seriously.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:10%
But everywhere
around the world--

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:10%
particularly in North America--

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:10%
there are many hundreds,
if not thousands,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.230 align:middle line:10%
of examples of giant bones
being found, particularly

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:10%
in things like Native
American mounds associated

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:10%
with a culture
known as the Adena,

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:10%
who existed during
the first millennia BC

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:10%
in many parts of
the United States.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:10%
And it would seem as
if there, elites--

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:10%
the elite group in charge of
the different clans and tribes--

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:10%
were very often of
increased size--

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:10%
7 to 7.5 feet tall.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're now looking at these
as possibly the descendants

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Denisovans, what we'd
call the Denisovan hybrids.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And these are remembered
in various different Native

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.010 align:middle line:84%
American traditions
under a number of names,

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
the most popular of which would
seem to be the Thunder People.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
They had the ability to call
upon lightning, and thunder,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and rain, and they were
said to wear feather cloaks,

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and they were said
to be shape-shifters,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and that the Native American
peoples were dead scared

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:10%
They were incredibly scared of
them because of their height,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:10%
and their abilities, and
their magical powers.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And these stories
are particularly

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:84%
strong amongst the
Algonquin-speaking peoples

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Lakes and
St. Lawrence River areas.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And they called
them the Animikii,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
which is a word very
similar to the Anunnaki.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's probably
even the same root

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.255 align:middle line:84%
of some of the
components of that word.

00:07:50.255 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And these were the Thunder
People, the thunder men,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:84%
the thunder birds, because
that's ultimately the way

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
that they've been remembered
in Native American tradition,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:90%
as the thunder bird--

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:84%
these giant birds that could
shape shift into human form,

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
could even mate with humans
and produce families.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, these were
not normal birds.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think these are
an abstract memory

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:84%
of shamans and shamanic
groups of these individuals,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
who we would now
see and identify

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.810 align:middle line:84%
with Denisovan hybrids
who probably existed

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:84%
in North America from as
much as 45,000 years ago down

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
almost to the point
of historical contact

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:90%
in the 16th, 17th century.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.959 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is interesting.

00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
When you say hybrids, what
are you talking about?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Hybridization between what and
what, to create these beings?

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: The hybridization
is between our own ancestors--

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that's modern humans,
Homo sapiens--

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:90%
and Denisovans themselves.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And the way that
this happened initially

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
was, when we came out
of Africa in waves

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:84%
from around 200,000
years ago down

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:84%
to anything of around
40,000 years ago,

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:90%
we were coming out of Africa.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
We would going either
westward into Europe

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:84%
or we were going eastwards
through Southwest Asia

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:90%
into Central Asia.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem as if we
encountered the Denisovans

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:90%
along a line.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.360 align:middle line:84%
They didn't seem to
be any further west

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:90%
than a certain point.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:10%
It's what I call
the Denisovan line,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.728 align:middle line:10%
and it runs from the Arctic
north-- where, obviously,

00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:10%
there wouldn't have been
an awful lot of activity,

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:10%
human or otherwise--

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:10%
down through the Altai
mountains of Siberia,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.280 align:middle line:10%
down through Central Asia,
and the Pamir mountains

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:10%
of Afghanistan, then through
the Indus Valley of Pakistan,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:10%
down to the coast of Pakistan
in the area of Karachi.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:10%
This is a line of activity.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And it seems as if, as we
were passing that line,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
going every eastwards, we
encountered the Denisovans,

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
we mated with them, and
we continued on, taking

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
their genes, their DNA,
with us-- their ancestry--

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.270 align:middle line:84%
as we went further into
East Asia, Southeast Asia,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Melanesia, Australia, and
eventually, obviously,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:90%
across into North America.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, the
Denisovans died off

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
around 40,000 years
ago but we still

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:90%
continued our course eastwards.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But now we'd had much less, if
not any, Denisovan DNA with us,

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:84%
so that almost
whitewashed a lot of what

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
had gone in advance of us,
which meant that there were

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:84%
only isolated areas
that now retained really

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:90%
high levels of Denisovan DNA.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And we know that, through
many people's work,

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:84%
we understand now
that humanity has

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
had fairly sophisticated
art work for at least

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.770 align:middle line:84%
the last 40,000 years, but
not all tribes demonstrated

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
this level of sophistication
in their rendering of art,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.470 align:middle line:84%
But that one of the
key features in art,

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and this certainly
goes into Egyptology,

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
is that the rulers are often
proportionately out of size

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the people.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And I personally don't believe
that that was just symbolic.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I think they were capturing
something beyond symbolism.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
the Egyptian part of the story

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit, but they would
have passed on-- these thunder

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:90%
bird people--

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
would have passed on this
knowledge in their abilities

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:84%
with those that they
encountered and mated

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.878 align:middle line:84%
with as well because
they had to be

00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
of a very advanced
level of knowledge

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to be able to master the
forces in such-- the weather

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And all the way
around the world,

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
we have stories of the
gods, the forerunners of us

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:84%
as mere mortals, whether they
are the watchers, the Nephilim,

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki of
Mesopotamia tradition.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Quite literally, all
of these forerunners

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
were of increased
size, generally.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was from them that we
get the knowledge and wisdom

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
of civilization, all
the rudiments that

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.430 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to evolve
into what we are today.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that this is
a memory of the hybridization

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:84%
dissection between ourselves,
and the Denisovans,

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and to a degree also,
the Neanderthals,

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
because virtually everybody
in the Western world--

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
everybody that came
out of Africa--

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.380 align:middle line:84%
encountered also
the Neanderthals.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:90%
We mated with them.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have a small amount of
DNA of Neanderthals as well.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:90%
It's around 2%, generally.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But within the
Denisovan populations,

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:84%
the modern peoples that
contain Denisovan DNA,

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:90%
it's up to 5% to 6%.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in
Melanesia and Australia,

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
amongst the original
people there,

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
they have this high
amount of Denisovan DNA.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, if they had
their DNA done through Ancestry,

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:84%
or whatever one of these
DNA companies are--

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
23andMe-- what
would it come up as?

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: It could
easily come up as--

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Would it say that?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.521 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
they're labeling it as now?

00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: With 23andMe,
and Ancestry.com,

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and similar sites like
this, what they will do

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:84%
is they will tell you
your human ancestry,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:84%
what part of the world
that you come from,

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:84%
but they will also
tell you whether you

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
have got what level of
Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I've had people write
to me and say, look,

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:90%
I found I've got Denisovan DNA.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And I just say to
them, tell me also

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.184 align:middle line:90%
what your human ancestry is?

00:13:41.184 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, I was
brought up in Melanesia.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, there you go.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that the
populations of Melanesia

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:84%
have high levels
of Denisovan DNA.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But what's more important is the
impact of this Denisovan DNA.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:90%
What does it actually mean?

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.760 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean to the human?

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
How does it express itself
in a human being now?

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, it can
come out, for instance,

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:84%
among the Inuit, as
previously mentioned,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:84%
that they've got a gene that
allows them-- in fact, two--

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
that allows them to exist in
extremely cold conditions.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It allows them to
bulk up and exist

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.780 align:middle line:84%
where most other people
could not possibly

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.080 align:middle line:90%
subsist for any length of time.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
The Sherpas, Tibetans, have
this high-altitude gene.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:84%
That's also been passed
on from Denisovans.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
resistances to diseases

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that have been passed onto the
Han Chinese people of China.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
That also came from
the Denisovans.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But when we start finding
out that the Denisovans had

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:84%
a gene-- or maybe even more
than one-- related to autism,

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:84%
then it starts becoming
really, really interesting.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.765 align:middle line:84%
Because our views of autism
are obviously quite biased--

00:15:00.765 --> 00:15:02.144 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:02.144 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --through
what we understand.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.610 align:middle line:84%
We're only now, for the first
time, beginning to see autism

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:84%
as a particularly important
type of human thinking,

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
that although different
to other people,

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:84%
has its own special qualities
and its own importance.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, along
that line, perhaps

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:84%
telepathic communication was
more prevalent in that time.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't have the need to
have to settle in, articulate,

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
slow down, that it was
more instantaneous types

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.865 align:middle line:90%
of transference of information.

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: It's
extremely likely.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Just this week, a paper
has been published

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
talking about autism
and its effects

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:84%
upon, not just early forms of
communication between humans,

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
but also our ability to
be creative within art,

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.916 align:middle line:84%
within technology, to
develop [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's kind of
non-linear thinking,

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
putting pieces together
in an interesting way.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: It is.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But it all came
through isolation--

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:84%
isolation at the time
of the last ice age.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that these same
genes relate to the Denisovans,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.137 align:middle line:84%
and they also would appear,
by virtue of the other genes

00:16:14.137 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:84%
that we know that they've
got, to have lived

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
in isolation and
at high altitudes

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and in extremely cold climates.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So this autistic
gene that they had

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:90%
could start explaining why--

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is where it
starts to get incredibly

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
interesting-- why as early as
60,000 to 70,000 years ago,

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:84%
they were creating the
most beautiful jewelry

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:90%
that you can imagine.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Why they may well have
been riding horses.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:10%
Why they created the earliest
bone needles in the world so

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:10%
they were wearing
tailored clothing.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Why they were making
musical instruments--

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
the earliest instruments
anywhere in the world.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.696 align:middle line:84%
And that might well have
given them an understanding

00:16:57.696 --> 00:16:59.160 align:middle line:90%
of sound acoustics.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And also why they may well
have taken an interest

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:84%
in the sun, and the
moon, and Eclipse cycles

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
to generate incredible
sequences of numbers that

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
have been passed down to various
cultures around the world,

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
with key numbers that clearly
come from some primeval source,

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:23.420 align:middle line:84%
numbers like 54, 108, 432,
which crop up again and again

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:84%
in different cultures
from Southeast Asia,

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
to Mesopotamia, to Northern
Europe, to Egypt, India,

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.140 align:middle line:90%
as time cycles and cyclic time.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Many of my colleagues have
been looking for the source

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:90%
of these numbers.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Now we have an answer.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.050 align:middle line:84%
They came from the
Denisovans, who

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
had this incredible autistic
or savant-like mindset that

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.390 align:middle line:84%
allowed them to remember
number sequences in a way which

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.230 align:middle line:84%
we have just not really
had the need to do

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
in our own modern
human existence.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just,
as you said, it's

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
not isolated to one or
two areas of the world.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:10%
The presence of
these larger rulers,

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:10%
for example, or leaders
in a given area,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:10%
it reminds me of one of the
examples in Richard Dewhurst's

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:10%
book having to do with a royal
couple that was buried in,

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:10%
I believe it was Ohio.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:10%
The remains of which
were, again, they

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:10%
were 8 feet tall, 9 feet tall,
but they were in an embrace.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:84%
They were buried in an
embrace, the royal couple.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And she was drenched in
strings of beautiful pearls

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:90%
all over her entire body.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And they did beautiful
brassworks and jewelry and such

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:90%
then too.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course dating is
always the big problem.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
But part of the
issue in finding more

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.504 align:middle line:84%
of these interesting remains
in the United States is--

00:18:52.504 --> 00:18:53.670 align:middle line:90%
and this is just part of it.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:10%
Part of it is land owned by
the government, part of it

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:10%
is land also owned by
Native American tribes.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:10%
And oftentimes, the tribes
don't want their own history

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.350 align:middle line:10%
being disturbed by digging
into the remains of people

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:10%
that predated them.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:10%
And we're far more sophisticated
in their day, going deeper,

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:10%
deeper we go, the more
sophisticated the cultures,

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:10%
it seems.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Well, absolutely.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And it is actually quite a
political issue, of course.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And it's one
which we have to tread very

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:90%
carefully in the 21st century.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I have to be
very careful with virtually

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
every word that I use
in any of my books.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter is
that thousands of giant bones

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:84%
have been found in
many different mounds.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.050 align:middle line:84%
They've all gone today,
every single one of them.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
They were all repatriated
with the NAGPRA agreement

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the 1980s,
beginning of the 1990s.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.364 align:middle line:84%
They were all given back to
Native American tribes, who

00:19:56.364 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
essentially could do what
they want with them, which

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:90%
was presumably re-bury them.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Which is ironic and very
sad, because it was just

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.710 align:middle line:84%
a matter of a couple of
years after that time

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:84%
that genetic anthropology
really started

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
coming into its own
right, so we were not

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:84%
able to genetically test for
the DNA of any giant bone, which

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
is a terrible
situation, and it's one

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.349 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking to try and
rectify at this very time.

00:20:27.349 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's important.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Because
until we find a bone,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
we cannot test them to find out
whether they may be linked with

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Denisovans or not.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.923 align:middle line:84%
My money would be on
the fact that the are.

00:20:38.923 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And the giant bones
that are found

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:84%
are not simply that of people
with gigantism, which is

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:90%
obviously a genetic disorder.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we
can say that is

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
because the recorded
percentage of giant skeletons

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
found in many different
mounds, particularly

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:84%
in Ohio and West Virginia,
is something like 17%--

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and that's much, much
higher than the percentage

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
of any human population who
might produce gigantism, which

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:84%
is something that we see,
for instance, in basketball

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:90%
players.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: We see many
guys that are 7 feet tall

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
or taller, who use their
height for that purpose.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Those guys are
experiencing-- or suffered

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.780 align:middle line:84%
is probably not the right
word-- but have gigantism.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're so tall.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:84%
That's nothing to do with
the Denisovans and any genes

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.742 align:middle line:84%
that they might have passed
on to their descendants.

00:21:36.742 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, is
it possible then

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that the people rose in stature,
they recorded that stature,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
because of their size
in ancient times too?

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: It's possible.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But we just simply
don't know enough.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.526 align:middle line:84%
It's important to remember
that we didn't even

00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:51.424 align:middle line:84%
know the Denisovans
existed until 2012.

00:21:51.424 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I'm surprised

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:84%
it comes up in genetic testing,
that they've actually given it

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:90%
a name.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:10%
Let's move on in the
story to Gobekli Tepe

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:10%
because this is where you
feel some of their knowledge

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:10%
was continuing to
express itself.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe is arguably
the most important

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
archaeological site in
the world at this time--

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uncovered, absolutely.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: It was first
uncovered in the mid-1990s

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:10%
by a German archaeologist named
Professor Klaus Schmidt, who's

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.980 align:middle line:10%
sadly no longer with
us, and he recognized

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:10%
the importance of the site.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:10%
And what they found were a
series of stone enclosures

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:10%
with standing stones that
would T-shaped in appearance,

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:10%
that were in this form because
they were abstract humans,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.040 align:middle line:10%
that the T-shape
termination was actually

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.610 align:middle line:10%
the head of the
individuals, the bodies.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Many of the stones had arms in
relief coming around the side,

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.205 align:middle line:84%
ending in these long,
spindly fingers at the front.

00:22:52.205 --> 00:22:53.829 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it
was very interesting.

00:22:53.829 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: They were set like
in the spokes of a wheel,

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:10%
pointing towards the center of
these enclosures, where there

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.650 align:middle line:10%
were two massive,
great monoliths, also

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.040 align:middle line:10%
with T-shaped terminations
that were also

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.320 align:middle line:10%
anthropomorphic in appearance.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And many of the sounds are
carved with beautiful animals.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing
is that the earliest

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:84%
of these enclosures is
11,500 years in age.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And what's significant is
that the most sophisticated,

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
the largest, and the most
intriguing of these enclosures

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:90%
are the oldest.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And although building
continued at Gobekli Tepe

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
for around 1,500
years, the enclosures

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:84%
got smaller and
smaller, more and more

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
simpler, their orientation
got less and less,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
until it almost looked
like they were just

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:90%
going through the motions.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And then they just stopped,
buried what was left,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and cleared off to some other
part of the ancient world.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But what we know about
these incredible enclosures

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
at Gobekli Tepe is that
they're astronomically aligned.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:10%
They're aligned to a bright star
in the constellation of Cygnus,

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:10%
the cosmic bird also known
as the Northern Cross, which

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.285 align:middle line:10%
was situated on the Milky Way,
where the Milky Way splits

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:10%
in two and forms a point in
the center of the heavens that

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:10%
was always seen as an entrance
and exit to the sky world--

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.076 align:middle line:10%
the land of the dead,
or the afterlife as you

00:24:25.076 --> 00:24:25.991 align:middle line:10%
might want to call it.

00:24:25.991 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you talking
about the holes of the souls?

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:90%
The soul holes?

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.846 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:31.846 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:84%
What you're
referring to here is,

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe, directly in
line with the orientation

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
of the central pillars,
is this stone--

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:90%
we call it a porthole stone.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:84%
It's got a little hole in it,
not big enough for anybody

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to get through, that would allow
somebody standing in the middle

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.120 align:middle line:84%
of the enclosure, between
the two huge megaliths which

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
stand almost like a star
gate towards the cosmos

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:84%
south, that you would be able
to look through this hole--

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
whether this was actual or
symbolic, we don't know--

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.450 align:middle line:84%
towards the setting of
the bright star Deneb

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.310 align:middle line:84%
in the constellation
of Cygnus, also

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.080 align:middle line:90%
known as the Northern Cross.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.060 align:middle line:90%
And this was purposeful.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Quite clearly, what
the shamans that

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:84%
were using these
structures were doing

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
was projecting in their
minds, most likely

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
in altered states of
consciousness or trance states,

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:84%
into the other world
that they perceived

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.720 align:middle line:84%
as existing in the direction
of the constellation of Cygnus.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:10%
Cygnus is a bird, and
it's no coincidence

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.580 align:middle line:10%
that the human soul was seen
to take the form of a bird

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:10%
to travel from the physical
world into the other world.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
universal principle.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:90%
It's in the ancient world.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.390 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Americas.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a universal idea.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:90%
The type of bird changes.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.410 align:middle line:84%
At Gobekli Tepe the soul
bird was the vulture.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
In North America, for instance,
it's the eagle, the hawk.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:10%
And in other parts
of Eurasia, it's

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:10%
the swan or goose who
are important symbols,

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:10%
not only of the soul, but
the Cygnus constellation.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.060 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to this, the
enclosures at Gobekli Tepe

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:84%
are all perfectly constructed
to maximize sound acoustics.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:26.480 align:middle line:84%
They have 4:3 ratio in a perfect
ellipse that is unquestionably

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:84%
done with the idea
that there was

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:90%
some purpose in using sound--

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the human voice
or musical instruments--

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:84%
to increase, not
just tones but what's

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.930 align:middle line:90%
known as musical intervals--

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:84%
the perfect fourth,
perfect fifth--

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
to create the perfect
note, the perfect sound,

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
to induce altered
states of consciousness.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And we find these
same proportions

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.040 align:middle line:84%
4:3 or 3:2, which relate to
the perfect fourth or perfect

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:84%
fifth, in megalithic or
Neolithic constructions

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:90%
all the way around the world.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's also there,
certainly in symbolic form,

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:84%
on the pyramid field at
Giza where, obviously, we

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:90%
find the Great Pyramid.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
all of these ideas

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
are a legacy that have
come from the Denisovans.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
We can trace a route from
Gobekli Tepe, 11,500 BC,

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:84%
back through the
Russian steppes,

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:84%
through the Ural mountains
that divide Europe with Asia,

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
into southern Siberia, and
the Altai mountains where,

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.530 align:middle line:84%
of course, the Denisovans
were found right the way

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:90%
through to 40,000 BC.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And their successors,
their hybrid descendants,

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:84%
continued their legacy
after this time,

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.680 align:middle line:84%
spreading into different
parts of the ancient world.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, through
this technology that had,

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:84%
they had invented
through the acoustics,

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:84%
were there any
other measurements--

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:84%
earth energy measurements
or anything else that

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:84%
had been done at Gobekli
Tepe besides the acoustic

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.550 align:middle line:84%
measurements to show that this
is very energy-saturated area?

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Not officially, no.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.826 align:middle line:90%
Not officially.

00:28:13.826 --> 00:28:17.120 align:middle line:84%
You obviously need
to remember that it's

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:90%
an archaeological site.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It's still under
excavation at the moment.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Access to the general
public is limited

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:90%
to certain areas that are open.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And it has just
reopened, by the way,

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.420 align:middle line:84%
almost like a Turkish
Stonehenge, by the way,

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.730 align:middle line:90%
and it looks good.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.652 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
there soon again.

00:28:36.652 --> 00:28:39.235 align:middle line:84%
So, no is the answer as far as
any official work is concerned.

00:28:39.235 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I was just wondering.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.508 align:middle line:90%
At least you have the--

00:28:40.508 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: But it's an
incredibly energetic place.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: It's at the tail
end of a mountain range known

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:10%
as the Anti-Taurus
Mountains, and these

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:10%
are notorious for strange
light and UFO sightings.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:10%
This is something I've
noted in one of my books.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:10%
And it could well be that
the placement of Gobekli Tepe

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.237 align:middle line:10%
was due to the fact of
strange phenomena occurring

00:29:05.237 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:10%
in that particular region.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:06.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I was getting to.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, that's
probably correct.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So with these
saturated frequencies,

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.880 align:middle line:84%
everything set up
the way it was there,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.540 align:middle line:84%
it said they could also
travel through these portals

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to the realm of the dead, to
be able to meet with beings

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.690 align:middle line:90%
in other dimensions.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think our audience
finds multi-dimensionality

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.890 align:middle line:84%
particularly fascinating,
so let's talk about it

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:28.835 align:middle line:90%
on that level.

00:29:28.835 --> 00:29:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we don't
know exactly what

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
was going on at Gobekli
Tepe but I would think

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:90%
it goes something like this--

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:84%
you've got the
shamans and probably

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:90%
initiates doing their thing.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:90%
They've probably got dances.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.640 align:middle line:84%
They're using sound-- both the
human voice and instruments

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're achieving a certain
state, a certain moment,

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.640 align:middle line:84%
that's going to allow them
to project themselves out

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:84%
from the physical plane into
an otherworldly environment.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.060 align:middle line:90%
So what are they doing then?

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Where are they going?

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I suspect
that they believe

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.600 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
either into the heavens,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.710 align:middle line:84%
into the sky world
itself, or generally

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:19.280 align:middle line:84%
many of these shamanic cultures
believed in an underworld

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:84%
as well, which they refer
to as the beneath world.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And they could project
themselves into any of these,

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.310 align:middle line:84%
depending on whatever
duties that they were doing.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:35.834 align:middle line:84%
And of course, once they're
in these environments, which

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.250 align:middle line:84%
from our point of view you
say, well, where do they exist?

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're around
us all the time.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:90%
They're generally invisible.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It's believed that the spirits,
cosmic beings, ancestors,

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:52.265 align:middle line:84%
celestial angels or whatever,
exist within these realms,

00:30:52.265 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:90%
and that they're all accessible.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And these people would
have projected themselves

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.690 align:middle line:84%
into an environment
where I could communicate

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.030 align:middle line:90%
with them on a one to one.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, I believe that these
spirit forms, these entities,

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.060 align:middle line:90%
probably did exist.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.690 align:middle line:90%
They may well be cosmic beings.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:84%
They could well relate
to extraterrestrials.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:84%
They could well relate to
other dimensional entities.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.440 align:middle line:90%
They could well be out of time.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It may well be that
they're speaking

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:84%
to somebody in the future
or even in the past.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Because quite clearly,
on a subatomic level,

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:84%
when you start using
what we refer to today

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.890 align:middle line:90%
as quantum entanglement--

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:84%
which is probably the solution
for things like telepathy

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.490 align:middle line:90%
and even precognition--

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:90%
that there is no time.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Time does not exist.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So that once you're
in those realms,

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.380 align:middle line:84%
the sky's the limit,
quite literally.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.416 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you can
communicate with whoever.

00:31:53.416 --> 00:31:55.290 align:middle line:84%
You could even be
communicating with yourself

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.910 align:middle line:90%
in some future situation.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:00.084 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And of course, we
can't determine exactly what

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:84%
they were doing but
it was giving them

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.690 align:middle line:84%
knowledge and wisdom that was
able to be translated back

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:90%
into the tribal, the clan.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.640 align:middle line:84%
They were then able to use
this for their benefit,

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:84%
maybe to increase their
knowledge of technology,

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.020 align:middle line:90%
of sound.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.260 align:middle line:84%
They could have been using
it for healing, of course,

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:84%
or their understanding
of what they do next.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Because during the
time of Gobekli Tepe,

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
we have the
Neolithic revolution.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.130 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
have the introduction

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:35.070 align:middle line:84%
of many firsts for humanity like
agriculture, animal husbandry,

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:84%
the first metal work, the
first alcohol, the first beer

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and wine all occurs in--
not just at this time,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.830 align:middle line:84%
but in the very area
of Gobekli Tepe.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, there's this
huge leap forward going on,

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and I would link all of
this as the next step

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:84%
from something that began
with the Denisovans as early

00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:01.110 align:middle line:84%
as 45,000 years ago,
back in southern Siberia.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:02.622 align:middle line:90%
There's a direct link.

00:33:02.622 --> 00:33:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But of course, then we'd
have to ask ourselves, well,

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:90%
what happens next?

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And yesterday-- this
is just kind of flowing

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.310 align:middle line:90%
in as we're talking--

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I just met with Manjir
Samanta-Laughton for lunch,

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking about the
notion of black holes and time

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and how they have
a breath to them

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:90%
of expansion and contraction.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And during the
periods of, I believe,

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:84%
during the contraction,
she was saying

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:84%
where all of the
dimensional veils

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:84%
are much closer
and more compressed

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.160 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors were able
to quite easily access and see

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.890 align:middle line:84%
into these gods,
or these demons,

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.360 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
wish to call them--

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:90%
entities from other realms.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.940 align:middle line:84%
It was not as difficult
as it is for us now.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And that we're just kind
of moving back into that.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:53.022 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense that back
then, if that theory is true--

00:33:53.022 --> 00:33:54.480 align:middle line:84%
well, obviously,
they were anyway--

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.240 align:middle line:84%
but if that theory is true,
that it was an easier task

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.850 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move
between dimensions.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, as I
said, the Denisovans--

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:90%
let's take it back to them.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.734 align:middle line:84%
What if they were
shape-shifters?

00:34:05.734 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:84%
They're moving between
dimensions anyway.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.159 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: They are.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:08.959 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:11.670 align:middle line:84%
We have to differentiate,
when we say shape-shifting,

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.020 align:middle line:90%
of what that actually means.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:13.939 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:13.939 --> 00:34:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And from
my point of view,

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I see this as a purely shamanic
thing, that people would adopt

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:84%
the form of a particular
animal or bird

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make
that transition

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.100 align:middle line:90%
from this world to the next.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.409 align:middle line:10%
For instance, if
it's a bird, they

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.875 align:middle line:10%
would wear cloaks of feathers.

00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:35.250 align:middle line:10%
They would wear
around their neck

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:38.800 align:middle line:10%
probably the talons of birds.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.980 align:middle line:84%
They may even have the whole
bird on the top of their head.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Some Native American
tribes did this.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well,
look at Egyptology.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:45.485 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:34:45.485 --> 00:34:46.460 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, of course.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:10%
And that, therefore, then--

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.344 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We're
going there next.

00:34:49.344 --> 00:34:51.900 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: --comes
down to ancient Egypt.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.659 align:middle line:10%
And when they therefore
adopt that form,

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:10%
they believe
wholeheartedly that they

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.620 align:middle line:10%
are becoming those animals.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:84%
They will actually see
the world through the eyes

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.750 align:middle line:84%
of that animal, whether
it be a bird or a wolf.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.340 align:middle line:90%
They could run like the wolf.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, we might do
this in meditations.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.850 align:middle line:84%
We might accept that we can
see through the eyes of a wolf.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But for them, they
became the wolf.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.460 align:middle line:84%
People would look at
a wolf out in the wild

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and identify that with
a particular shaman.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.770 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, oh look,
there's such and such shaman

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.810 align:middle line:90%
on his run for the night.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.850 align:middle line:90%
It was that type of connection.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:35.050 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
was fully believed, 100%.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's something we find
quite difficult to relate

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.505 align:middle line:90%
to today in some ways.

00:35:39.505 --> 00:35:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
true because those

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:84%
were understanding the nature
of reality at an atomic level.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.670 align:middle line:84%
This was a mastery over
the material world.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And because of their
belief, their 100% belief,

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.930 align:middle line:84%
they were able to do it a lot
better than we could do it

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:52.550 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.988 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And I would
think there are actually

00:35:54.988 --> 00:35:59.160 align:middle line:84%
very few human societies
existing today that

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.670 align:middle line:90%
have that 100% belief.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.930 align:middle line:84%
There probably are in the more
remote parts of, let's say,

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Africa, or South America,
or Indonesia, or something

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.650 align:middle line:84%
like that, but it
is something that

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.225 align:middle line:84%
is becoming more and
more difficult to find.

00:36:13.225 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And belief is key because
the material world

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:19.620 align:middle line:84%
follows the mind and the energy
that's created with that.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.705 align:middle line:90%
So with that, let's travel down.

00:36:21.705 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:84%
You flirted with
it a moment ago.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.714 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Egypt.

00:36:24.714 --> 00:36:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
actually, we can't

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.435 align:middle line:84%
go to Egypt without touching
on Atlantis at some point.

00:36:29.435 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Well, why not.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's go there.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: OK.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, look-- which
actually brings us back

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.330 align:middle line:90%
to some fundamental questions.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Because what is civilization?

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Where did we come
from originally?

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And up to now, I
think there have

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.300 align:middle line:90%
been two metaphysical answers.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.500 align:middle line:84%
One is that civilization
came from some kind of mother

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.700 align:middle line:84%
civilization that
existed in Atlantis.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And the other being that,
maybe we were seeded by aliens.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you have that
view, that's fine.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.370 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely fine.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
problem with that

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.700 align:middle line:84%
is that it then creates a
dead end because although we

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.710 align:middle line:84%
might be able to locate
Atlantis in a certain part

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.510 align:middle line:90%
of the world--

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.375 align:middle line:84%
I favor the area of the
Caribbean and the Bahamas--

00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:24.610 align:middle line:84%
we haven't found any
Atlantis civilization.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.790 align:middle line:84%
We have not been able to
find any particular city

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:84%
with "Welcome to Atlantis"
written on it yet.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And so it's almost
like a dead end in some ways.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:84%
We can say, well, look, the
philosopher Plato told us

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:45.820 align:middle line:84%
in 350 BC that Greek and
Egyptian civilization came

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:84%
from Atlantis but
that's one man's word.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
psychics, like Edgar Cayce--

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.740 align:middle line:84%
the sleeping prophet, the
great American psychic--

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:00.690 align:middle line:84%
he also spoke about
Atlantis and how

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Egypt benefited from the sinking
of Atlantis around 10,500 BC.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But that's about as
far as we can go.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And as far as aliens are
concerned, until we actually

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:15.270 align:middle line:84%
confirm that aliens exist
and have first contact,

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.500 align:middle line:84%
that also becomes a
very difficult route

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.940 align:middle line:84%
to take without anatomical
or archaeological evidence.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But now we have a third
option with the Denisovans.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Now there becomes
the possibility

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.570 align:middle line:84%
that the Denisovans actually
gifted us civilization,

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that they were more intelligent
than some of our earliest

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.900 align:middle line:90%
ancestors.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And that when we first
encountered them, when we first

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.690 align:middle line:84%
interbred with
them, their legacy

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:84%
was handed to us, which is
why we advanced very quickly

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.310 align:middle line:84%
from about 45,000 years
ago, which coincides

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:56.080 align:middle line:84%
with the start of what's known
as the upper Paleolithic age.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us
back to Gobekli Tepe.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Did the knowledge
of the Denisovans

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.060 align:middle line:90%
benefit us at Gobekli Tepe?

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.477 align:middle line:90%
I think the answer is yes.

00:39:04.477 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But obviously many other parts
of the world as well, but let's

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.740 align:middle line:90%
focus on Gobekli Tepe.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we can
show is that there's

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:15.749 align:middle line:84%
a direct line of transmission
from Gobekli Tepe into Egypt.

00:39:15.749 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
part of the problem

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.930 align:middle line:84%
is we're not able
to properly date

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.300 align:middle line:84%
these civilizations,
especially Egypt.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.640 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it through
the hermetic view,

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.366 align:middle line:84%
they would say that the Great
Pyramid is 85,000 years old.

00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch-- although,
I shouldn't tattle on him

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:34.510 align:middle line:84%
in private-- said
to people that just

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.570 align:middle line:84%
looking at the pyramid of
Giza, the first time he saw it,

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.450 align:middle line:84%
he would have guessed it
to be 100,000 years old.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So now, if we start looking
at timelines out of Egypt

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.160 align:middle line:84%
alone that extend vastly
beyond what we understand,

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and if Atlantis did
exist, these very well

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
could have been
concurrent societies

00:39:54.490 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:84%
with these Denisovans traveling,
taking knowledge, taking

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.562 align:middle line:84%
architecture, practices,
and so forth, right?

00:40:02.562 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: It could be.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to be careful,
though, as far

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:10.660 align:middle line:84%
as putting dates on
monuments without any kind

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.330 align:middle line:90%
of archaeological evidence.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.625 align:middle line:84%
There is a case, obviously,
for the Great Sphinx

00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:22.180 align:middle line:84%
at Giza being older than what
conventional archeology tells

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.620 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.635 align:middle line:90%
However, in my opinion--

00:40:25.635 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little bit of a
traditionalist in the sense--

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.926 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I understand.

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I pushed you a
bit but that's OK.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I believe that the
Great Pyramid and its neighbors

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:38.560 align:middle line:84%
were constructed probably
around 2,600 to 2,500 BC.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And this makes a lot of sense
of the astronomical alignments

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.330 align:middle line:84%
of that site, which have been
associated both with Cygnus,

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.680 align:middle line:84%
which is found in
connection with Gobekli

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Tepe and various other
parts of the world--

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.703 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And also Sirius.

00:40:51.703 --> 00:40:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --and, of course,
Orion as well, particularly.

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And these relate
quite specifically

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.570 align:middle line:90%
to 2,500, 2,600 BC.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Other people could take them
back much earlier, but as far

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:10.780 align:middle line:84%
as archaeo-astronomy
is concerned,

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:90%
it fits well for there.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying
that there was not

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.230 align:middle line:84%
activity going on
on the plateau prior

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:20.260 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
that there was.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I think that there were
monuments on the plateau,

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.910 align:middle line:84%
even before the time
of Gobekli Tepe,

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.950 align:middle line:84%
or certainly
contemporary with them.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.625 align:middle line:84%
How far we can push
them back really

00:41:29.625 --> 00:41:30.750 align:middle line:90%
is a matter of speculation.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:32.708 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't even
know with Gobekli Tepe.

00:41:32.708 --> 00:41:35.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know how far their
origins have extended, right?

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, we
can be pretty certain

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.570 align:middle line:90%
that it began around 9,500 BC.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is
that the oldest of the stone

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.530 align:middle line:84%
enclosures there are
on the bedrock itself.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.840 align:middle line:90%
They were built on the bedrock.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And when the earliest
enclosures had done their thing,

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.190 align:middle line:84%
they were covered
over and new ones

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:01.580 align:middle line:84%
were built either next to
them or on top of them.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.160 align:middle line:84%
They just covered them
over, built one on top,

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and Gobekli Tepe is like
a layer cake of activity

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:12.140 align:middle line:84%
with the youngest activity
at the top, near the surface,

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.610 align:middle line:90%
and the oldest at the bottom.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've reached the bedrock,
and the bedrock at the moment

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:19.076 align:middle line:90%
tells us 9,500 BC.

00:42:19.076 --> 00:42:20.450 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say
there might not

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.790 align:middle line:84%
be one or two structures
older than that

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.660 align:middle line:84%
but this also makes
sense of what was going

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.070 align:middle line:90%
on in the world at this time.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the world was recovering
from a massive cataclysm that

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.530 align:middle line:90%
had devastated--

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you talking
in terms of deluge?

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Deluge,
fires, a blackout

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of the sun and the
moon and stars,

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and lots of other
terrible things

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:90%
that had begun around 10,800 BC.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:54.830 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of a 1,200-year
period that climatologists

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:56.535 align:middle line:90%
refer to as the Younger Dryas.

00:42:56.535 --> 00:42:57.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:57.335 --> 00:42:59.335 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And this seems
to have been triggered

00:42:59.335 --> 00:43:03.220 align:middle line:84%
by a comet impact, mostly
effecting North America

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.170 align:middle line:84%
but also affecting
Europe, Southwest Asia,

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and leaving behind a
thick layer of black ash

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that has been found all
the way around the world.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.080 align:middle line:90%
So we know that it existed.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.210 align:middle line:84%
We know that it was
cosmic in origin.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And we know that by the time the
Gobekli Tepe was constructed,

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.760 align:middle line:84%
probably the people were still
in fear of these cataclysms

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.500 align:middle line:84%
occurring every time a
comet appeared in the sky.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of the answers for what
was going on at Gobekli Tepe

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:40.880 align:middle line:84%
is that it was constructed to
allow the shamans easy access

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.450 align:middle line:84%
into the sky world through
altered states of consciousness

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:47.180 align:middle line:84%
so that they could deal with
the supernatural forces,

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.120 align:middle line:84%
or more correctly,
creatures that they saw

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.170 align:middle line:90%
as responsible for cataclysms.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Generally, these were canine
in origin, like foxes, wolves,

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:58.534 align:middle line:90%
dogs, things like that.

00:43:58.534 --> 00:43:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And coyotes.

00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Coyotes.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Exactly These were
seen as tricksters that

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:90%
could bring about cataclysm.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.201 align:middle line:84%
And it was only the shamans
that could deal with them.

00:44:07.201 --> 00:44:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the shamans
would deal with them,

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.130 align:middle line:84%
come back to the local tribe
and say, look, don't worry.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.870 align:middle line:90%
We sorted it all out for you.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:19.580 align:middle line:84%
You won't be bothered by
these intruders into our sky.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.437 align:middle line:84%
You can all sleep peacefully
for the next few years

00:44:22.437 --> 00:44:23.520 align:middle line:90%
until another one appears.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At least
next 1,000 years.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.440 align:middle line:10%
And so, as we look
to the stars and we

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:10%
look to these feathered
beings as the average citizen

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:34.702 align:middle line:10%
of the day to start bringing the
answers to us from the portals

00:44:34.702 --> 00:44:37.160 align:middle line:10%
they're going through, certainly
one of the most well known

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:10%
has been to us now, Horus.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this takes us into
Egypt, this particular being,

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:50.044 align:middle line:84%
and begins taking us to an
answer to some of the mysteries

00:44:50.044 --> 00:44:51.210 align:middle line:90%
we've been looking for here.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.043 align:middle line:84%
So let's just take off
on Horus for a moment

00:44:53.043 --> 00:44:55.640 align:middle line:84%
before we wrap it up and
go back to the stars,

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and the origins of the
species, and these bird beings,

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.910 align:middle line:90%
and Cygnus.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:06.990 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: Horus actually
derives from a mythical being

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:12.960 align:middle line:10%
who was said to be a falcon in
the form of a man, basically,

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.680 align:middle line:10%
that was said to have
come down from heaven

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.470 align:middle line:10%
at the beginning
of time to start

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:20.780 align:middle line:10%
the first day, essentially.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And he had around him a
group of other birds--

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:28.050 align:middle line:84%
falcons-- which shows
that these were shamans,

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and that they founded the
first temple in Egypt.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.890 align:middle line:84%
This is recorded in the
so-called building texts

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:84%
of a temple at [NON-ENGLISH]
in southern Egypt that shows

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.030 align:middle line:84%
everything-- from the beginning
of the world to the creation

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.860 align:middle line:90%
of the first temples in Egypt.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:50.430 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, Horus actually
is a representation of this sky

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:52.240 align:middle line:10%
being, this cosmic being.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.360 align:middle line:10%
Where's he said to come from?

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.370 align:middle line:10%
The extreme north
in the direction

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.050 align:middle line:10%
of the Cygnus constellation.

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:02.810 align:middle line:84%
He was known as An or Anu,
the same root as Anunnaki.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:05.370 align:middle line:10%
And I find this incredible
that it could well

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:09.640 align:middle line:10%
be that the origins
of civilization itself

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.420 align:middle line:10%
don't only come
from the Denisovans

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.640 align:middle line:10%
but also that they
may well actually

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.575 align:middle line:10%
come from the cosmos itself.

00:46:16.575 --> 00:46:18.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And Cygnus is key.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.030 align:middle line:10%
This great, great galaxy.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.900 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: Cygnus
is unquestionably

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.805 align:middle line:10%
one of the most important
constellations of the night

00:46:24.805 --> 00:46:25.605 align:middle line:10%
sky.

00:46:25.605 --> 00:46:27.800 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Any final
comment before we wrap up?

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: No,
other than the fact

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:33.200 align:middle line:84%
that you can read all this
in "The Cygnus Key," which

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.980 align:middle line:90%
is the book on this.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.317 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to seeing
you and speaking again.

00:46:38.317 --> 00:46:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining us here, Andrew.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.461 align:middle line:90%
