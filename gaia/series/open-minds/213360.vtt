00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:17.830 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Unless one
is truly blessed with having

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:10%
learned at all, these times of
Pluto transiting into Aquarius

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:10%
have taken many
of us to the mat.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:84%
This includes many who have
done some of the hard work

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:84%
already, like Matías De Stefano
and myself for that matter.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:84%
While on a recent tour
of British sacred sites,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Matías and his group encountered
ancient Merlin-like beings

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:84%
who initiated them along
the way into the world

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:90%
we're moving into.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
It's good to see
you again, Matías.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MATIAS DE STEFANO: Nice.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So first of all,
tell us why you all decided--

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:90%
because Gaia went with you.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
You had a camera
crew and documented

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:84%
all of this, why you went to
Britain and these sacred sites

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:90%
What was the motivation?

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:10%
>> DE STEFANO: Well
for me, of course,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.900 align:middle line:10%
I did many trips alone
through Great Britain,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:10%
and I loved the island and
the sacred places that are out

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I feel very connected
to the place.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the first
time that I went there,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:84%
it was from of a message
that I received in Tibet.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I was in Tibet and in the
middle of the mountains,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
after seeing Shiva and all these
things, Merlin appeared to me

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and said, I wait for you in
seven days in a specific place.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:84%
He told me where to go,
and I wait for you there.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So seven days after
Tibet I went there,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and I started a path of 14
days through all the island.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And I knew since that moment,
that is a very amazing place

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
to actually bring
people to be initiated

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
in what the importance of
that island is in the world,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
not just for a
personal perception.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people were asking
me, when are we going there?

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.233 align:middle line:10%
Can you take us there?

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:10%
Can you take us there?

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:10%
And I usually
don't plan anything

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:10%
unless there is a
message that says there's

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:10%
a need for you to go there.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was following the
idea of the tree of life

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.605 align:middle line:84%
with the golden apples, which
is a very ancient story.

00:02:20.605 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're going
to have to explain that story

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.582 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Of course, yeah.

00:02:24.582 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
When I said, OK, where
can I find these apples,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:90%
these golden apples?

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the message
was in the land of apples,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's Apollonia,
apple-onia, which is Avalon.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So Avalon, the name Avalon
means the land of apples.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's true
when you go to Britain,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
they have many, many,
many varieties of apples.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So I said,
OK, there's a mission there

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.170 align:middle line:84%
of collecting these
apples for some reason.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know still.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know why
at that moment.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:10%
And of course,
hearing Gaia, Jason,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:10%
of course said, could you
go with you and film it?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, of course.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.757 align:middle line:10%
But you have to run behind.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What do you mean run?

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:10%
Because--

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:10%
>> DE STEFANO: Because it's all
outside, and it's all rainy,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:10%
and muddy, and cold.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So I said, we
will never know what is going

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we change directions
in the middle of the way.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of
an adventure too.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so now let's go
back to the story of the apples.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
According to the Greeks,
what are these apples about?

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Well, of course,
the word apple actually was not

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
meant to mean an apple
exactly but it was meant to be

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:90%
the description of any fruit.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So apple was a word in Europe to
define any tree that has fruits.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it describes
the tree of life.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why then when the
Semitic tradition started

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the tree of life,
they call it the apple tree

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and all the thing of Eve biting
the apple and stuff like that.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's not an apple,
it's a fruit, any kind of fruit.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:84%
So the tradition
says that the world

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.640 align:middle line:84%
was born in this tree
that has many apples,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:90%
and these fruits are golden.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:90%
They shine.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:90%
They're golden.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And they are being guarded
by a giant or a dragon, which

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.060 align:middle line:90%
is a guardian.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
For some of the Norse
tradition is a giant.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Some call it Mimir.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the south,
it was a dragon.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
The Mediterranean traditions,
they call it a dragon.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And if someone wants to
read more about the story,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
they call it the
Garden of Hesperides.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the 12
tasks that Hercules

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
had to accomplish in order
to gain his place in Olympus.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So the hero needed to
accomplish all these 12

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:90%
missions, and the 12 tasks.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was to
steal the golden apples

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
of the tree of the
Garden of Hesperides,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:90%
which is in the Canary Islands.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what they call
the Garden of Hesperides.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:90%
So they said there is a dragon.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And dragon actually
for the Greek word

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
is not a dragon as
we imagine today.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:84%
A dragon is actually a
draken or dracon, that

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:90%
means the one that observes.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's a guardian,
actually, someone

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.675 align:middle line:90%
that is taking care of a tree.

00:05:47.675 --> 00:05:48.475 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And in British lore, the
symbol of Wales, for example,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:90%
the Red Dragon.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The dragon runs
throughout British lore

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.585 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their
guardian through the ages.

00:06:00.585 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Their protector
through the ages.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.082 align:middle line:84%
So now here you are in
the land of the dragons.

00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Pursuing
the golden apples.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.157 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so now
you all get together.

00:06:11.157 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
How many people were in
this group to begin with--

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.040 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: 45
people, I think.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A pretty big group.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:90%
45.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so tell us
where you started in Britain.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So the
idea of being 45 people is

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:31.590 align:middle line:84%
because in the Atlantean
alphabet, there are 45 letters.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So this 45 letters
represent the sounds

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
of each one of the
apples, like the fruits

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of creation of this
tree, which actually

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
the tree, the
dragon, the observer

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:84%
represents the
Kundalini in the world.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And the apples
represent the nodes

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, which are
the portals through where

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:90%
the information comes through.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So in the story says that
humanity stole the apples

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.050 align:middle line:90%
and put them somewhere.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So from the Atlantic Ocean,
they were in England, Scotland.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose of
this group of 45

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:84%
was each one of us resounding
with one letter having

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:84%
one apple, activating one
of these informations.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
We needed to go to the
actual apples of stone,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the stone circles,
all along the island.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So through walking there, we
would activate some information

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
related to what the
apple means until we

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:90%
deliver all the apples back.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So each experience
was to give you another pixel

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.267 align:middle line:90%
of this larger picture?

00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:42.225 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:90%
You know family constellations?

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.898 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So basically,
when you have a trauma

00:07:49.898 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
or a problem that you want to
solve and you go to a therapist

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
that does this family
constellations,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
they locate objects or people to
represent things so you can move

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
around and reactivate it and
understand it in a different

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.440 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that when we
do this kind of trips,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:84%
we are doing a
family constellation

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:84%
but related to
mythology and geography.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, OK, we are doing
here the family constellation

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
of Hercules and
the golden apples,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and the family constellation
of where that happened,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:90%
which is in the North of Europe.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if a region
represents a part of yourself.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that makes sense.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Also when you look
at just the lore,

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:84%
we'll say lore
history of Atlantis,

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and the way it ultimately
broke down or aspects of it

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:84%
were destroyed from
the North to the South,

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:84%
the my understanding
from my studies

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.750 align:middle line:84%
also has been that knowledge,
the higher knowledge that

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:84%
ultimately became the druidic
knowledge actually came

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:84%
from Atlantis and
was transported over

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
before that portion
of Atlantis was sunk.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:90%
It went to Britain.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the first places

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.897 align:middle line:84%
that the people emigrated
to with the knowledge.

00:09:07.897 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of the first
priests and priestess

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.480 align:middle line:84%
that decided not to
create a civilization

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:84%
outside but a
civilization within.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So instead of building
great temples,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:84%
they created circles
where they could actually

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.150 align:middle line:84%
connect with that
knowledge through the stars

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
as they see the stars moving
around and not just building

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:90%
a civilization as Atlantis was.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.257 align:middle line:84%
It's like if today
our civilization--

00:09:39.257 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --as an
Indigenous natural.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:42.813 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:09:42.813 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like if today
civilizations fall apart

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and there are some
people that say,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:84%
let's create a different new
civilization, that was Egypt.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
people that say, no, let's

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
go back to the mountains and
reconnect with the stones

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.557 align:middle line:90%
like we used to do before.

00:09:57.557 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:90%
So that was England.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That was Britain,
absolutely, the British Isles.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, thank you for
setting that up for us.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
The show is called actually A
Journey of Remembering, right?

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yes.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So people can be
looking out for that.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:90%
So now let's begin.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Where did you start?

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Which geographical
location did you start in?

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk-- go through
to the first appearance

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.088 align:middle line:90%
of the first Merlin character.

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah, of course.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you take a look
into the British Isles,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of imagine or
see the shape of a woman.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And it has a crown,
which is in Scotland.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's sitting on its throne.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So with imagination,
you can perceive that

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.540 align:middle line:84%
on the territory,
which helps you

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to locate the chakras
of the territory

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
where the Kundalini
moves in the islands.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they start in the
south by La Manche Channel.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So the root chakra is around
that area, is around that part.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if we go to the
very beginning of the energy,

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
you have to go to a
place called Land's End.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't go there
because that region

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:84%
was for another purpose that
was not related to the apples.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
These apples in the
story, as for the planet,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:84%
are nodes for the tree are
fruits, for us is chakras,

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
or in our biological
body they are glands.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So these glands are
located in a line

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:84%
or in a zigzag shape
along the path.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So we needed to start where the
energy of the dragon starts,

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:90%
which is the south.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why first
we went to Avalon

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:84%
to ask permission to show
where we were going to do.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was, of
course, Glastonbury.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:10%
And I did something for
the 45 people, which was we

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:10%
gave them apples,
an apple to each.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:10%
And they were supposed to
take care of the apples

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:10%
during the entire trip.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:10%
So this is like your soul,
your information, your wisdom.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:10%
So you have to take care of
it as if it is within you.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:10%
But imagine that
you got it outside,

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:10%
and now it has the
shape of an apple,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:10%
and you have to take care of it.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So we started the
trip there in order

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
to prepare ourselves to
understand what the apple means,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
what the fruit means,
why this island is

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:90%
called the land of the apples.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And we started to introduce
the idea of our path, which

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:84%
was, there is an
information that

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.730 align:middle line:84%
is related to the entire
planet that is encrypted

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:90%
in the stories of this island.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So the mythology, the legends
that are in this island

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:84%
will tell us what to
do, how to work with it,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:90%
with the information.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have to pay
attention to everything

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that the druids or the
Merlins will tell us

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.060 align:middle line:84%
so we understand what
is the story that we

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:90%
are trying to talk about here.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the first step was
to prepare each one of us

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:90%
on that story.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.187 align:middle line:84%
And what was amazing
at that day was that--

00:13:34.187 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
in Glastonbury or--

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: This
is Glastonbury.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: We
went to the abbey.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:84%
We walked around, and I felt
someone calling me to a place

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that I've never been
in the abbey, which

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
was right on the
other side of the park

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:84%
where there is all
this apple trees.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's full of apple
trees and a lake

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:84%
that you can see the reflection
of the Tor, the tower that

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:90%
is in the heel of Glastonbury.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And in that place,
in the apple trees,

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
I started to receive the
first channeling of Merlin.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And for this, we
need an introduction

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.500 align:middle line:84%
of who Merlin is,
because sometimes we

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
think that Merlin is a person,
specifically called Merlin.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.960 align:middle line:90%
But actually it's not.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Actually, every high priest
druid was called Merlin.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.520 align:middle line:90%
It was not only one Merlin.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's like saying the Pope.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:84%
You have many names,
but the Pope is a title.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:90%
So Merlin is a title too.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the
name of a person.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Merlin actually is
the name of a bird,

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:54.240 align:middle line:84%
merle, this black bird that
lives in that region of Europe.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So usually
South England and North France.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Merlin is the
French name for that, merle,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:90%
which is this little bird.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when
a Druid achieved

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:84%
the highest level
of acknowledgment

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.067 align:middle line:90%
of reality, magic--

00:15:20.067 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mastery, wisdom

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO:
--mastery, wisdom.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:90%
They were called a new Merlin.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's not the
Merlin from Disney movies.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Or
the King Arthur.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
But even though every
Merlin has something

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
to say about that
story, of course.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first encounter
with Merlin, who basically

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:84%
made us see the reflection
of ourselves in the lake

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and started to tell
the story of the lady

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.647 align:middle line:90%
in the lake and the sword.

00:15:51.647 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you
share that with us?

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Because most people
are familiar with that.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah, of course,
because it's a very common

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful legend.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.243 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:15:59.243 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the lady is the
feminine aspect of creation.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And the sword is actually the
water, the limit of the water.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So it says that it has two sides
like the blade of the sword.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So in one is your reflection
from what you perceive yourself

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And the other side of the
sword is the reflection

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:84%
of who you are
meant to be or what

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
is your goal in this
life, your true self.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
We basically walk through
the edge of this sword,

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:84%
seeing if we fall into our
essence or into our personality.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So our constant
task is to find how

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
we can gain the inner power,
to use our personality in order

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish our mission as
essence, as the being that we

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
are, and not choose
only one side.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
We have to be in the center
in this little reflection

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:90%
of the lake.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
And the apples are
like all these chakras

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:90%
that the sword crossed through.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:84%
The story says that was the very
origin of the myth of the sword.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.550 align:middle line:90%
And then it became a stone.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
It became trapped
in the reality.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:84%
So now we are stuck
in this reality.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And unless you don't actually
locate all the golden apples

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.400 align:middle line:84%
where they belong in the right
position of your inner tree,

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
you cannot take the sword,
which is actually transforming

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.993 align:middle line:84%
yourself from a normal
fruit into gold,

00:17:41.993 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:90%
which is the philosophy of--

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --from your
perceived reality.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.538 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:17:45.538 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the inner
philosopher's stone.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So is the sword is in the
stone, which is a lead stone.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
the inner power

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
enough to put all
the apples, which

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:84%
is the chakras, the
emotions, the energy

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:84%
align inside yourself,
in that moment,

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
you can take the sword,
gain your inner power back,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.670 align:middle line:84%
which is not to fight,
but is to rule yourself.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:90%
And the lead turns into gold.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So the golden apples
appear in that moment

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:84%
when they reflect all the
colors of the rainbow.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So
what makes, again,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:84%
all these portals of the rainbow
in this territory are told that

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.060 align:middle line:84%
the goal at the
end of the rainbow.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that was happening
at that particular lake near

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:90%
the Tor?

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.653 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:18:36.653 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so you were all
together and you were studying

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
your reflection while this
story was being rendered?

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: They were
all sitting around the lake

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.988 align:middle line:84%
reflecting each
other with the apple.

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that was
your starting point?

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.197 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO:
That was the start.

00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To understand your
perceived reality and the actual

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
mass of the reality
of what you are.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And you were going to
do this integration that

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.018 align:middle line:84%
becomes wisdom, which allows you
to pull the sword out of your--

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: And become
the king or queen of your own

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
reality, yes which is
the last point of it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's the starting point.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: That's
the starting point.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about then
where you went from there,

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.283 align:middle line:84%
because Stonehenge is
pretty far south, too.

00:19:16.283 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah,
it's very close to.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like 45 minutes.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So was Stonehenge
your next stop,

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:84%
or was there something
else in between?

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: We
went first to Avebury.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So Avebury
is the feminine side.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And Stonehenge is
the masculine side.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Both together create
this helix of energy

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and the infinite
movement of energy that

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:90%
ignites the power of creation.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So these two places
are very important

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:90%
for that transformation.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:10%
So what we did in Avebury was
to connect with the mother cell,

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:10%
because when you go to Avebury,
you can see it's a huge circle.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.945 align:middle line:84%
It has even a small
village in the middle.

00:20:05.945 --> 00:20:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
I've been there.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.420 align:middle line:90%
So you have a big circle.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
very large circle.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.673 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Very large.

00:20:11.673 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you have two tiny
circles in the center that are

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.960 align:middle line:84%
broken, so you cannot really
relate that there are two

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But when you see them,
it's is like a cell that

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:90%
is about to divide in two.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's like vesica piscis
or mitosis, meiosis,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:90%
the process of creating a baby.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So that represents the
mother cell, creating life.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So we went there in order to
ask permission to the trees,

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.305 align:middle line:84%
to the holy trees
that are there,

00:20:43.305 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:84%
the guardians of the cell, and
to basically become ourselves

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:90%
the babies of that island.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the seeds of
what we have come here to sow.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in the past
wasn't Avebury used as a kind

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.662 align:middle line:84%
of a ritualistic
site for procreation?

00:21:03.662 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because a lot of
people go there and sit-in it.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.267 align:middle line:84%
You start seeing, experiencing
these rituals of the past.

00:21:10.267 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:16.770 align:middle line:84%
What I remember of that place
from very ancient times,

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
it was that men used to stay
in the outer circle and women

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:90%
in the inner circle.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And it would be ceremonies
for days, drumming, dancing,

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.680 align:middle line:90%
celebrating.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about giving to
the Earth to receive fertility.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: So it was--

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I assume all
of you were having your own

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
experiences within there too
and tapping into the past

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.748 align:middle line:84%
and the visions and
memories, right?

00:21:44.748 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah, of course.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So in every step, I
used to tell the people

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:84%
the story that I remember about
the place or the stories that

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
happened to me discovering
the place in this life.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So they have an idea
of why are we there,

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:84%
what are we doing
there, and then

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I basically guide a
meditation or an activation

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
where we could actually engage
with the land and the territory.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, always
asking permission first.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, that was the--

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that was where
the seed of life begins there.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.993 align:middle line:84%
So then you go to Stonehenge
and you did a sunrise ceremony?

00:22:29.993 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:10%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah, we did a
sunrise ceremony splitting--

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.895 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Talk about
that, what happened there.

00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:10%
>> DE STEFANO:
--into two groups.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the groups was
outside Stonehenge holding

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:84%
as the other half of
the group was inside,

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:90%
and then we switched places.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
When the inner group went
outside and the outer one

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.672 align:middle line:90%
came in.

00:22:48.672 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what was the
experience there after the very

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.600 align:middle line:90%
feminine experience of that?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: The feminine
experience was about

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:84%
understanding why we were
there and that we were creating

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:90%
something new.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So it was like the receiving
point of this, of these seeds

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:90%
that we are going to sow.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing because I
was looking for the right place

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:84%
to do the ceremony in
Avebury, and I sat on a place

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:84%
on one of the stones, and
I was talking to the stone.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, it's here.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly a
random person comes

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
through walking with a
pendulum, and he stops right

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:84%
in front of me, turns to me and
said, you are in the right spot.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There's your sign.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.077 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: You're
in the right spot.

00:23:39.077 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Here there is a line that
crosses from here to Scotland.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.705 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
that's why I'm here.

00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.622 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Thank you.

00:23:45.622 --> 00:23:47.110 align:middle line:90%
So it was like, OK, goodbye.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
confirmation in that moment.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And in Stonehenge,
what we did was

00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:84%
to, as we received the
seeds, now what we had to do

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:84%
was to transform the perception
that we had of our own seeds

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.370 align:middle line:84%
of what are we
doing in this trip.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So the masculine side
is all the patterns.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:84%
As the mother is
the matrix, which

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
is the connectivity
of everything,

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
the father side is the pattern.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And the pattern is
basically we are doing this

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:90%
because we want to go there.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So usually you live
your lives according

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:84%
to patterns that have been
designed by biology, designed

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
by culture, by your
tradition, by your family,

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and you keep following
those patterns.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of that ceremony
was to face the pattern,

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand why you
decided to come here, what

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:84%
is your intention with
this trip, with this path,

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and transform that
in 180 degrees.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So everyone had to
switch positions in order

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
to see themselves in a
completely different way,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.650 align:middle line:84%
releasing the idea of the
expectation of that pattern.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So they could actually
receive the seeds

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.630 align:middle line:90%
with a free pattern that--

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can give
birth to a new result.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: To a new result.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.667 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so this was
kind of a root chakra ceremony,

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:90%
as I understand?

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.848 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly, yeah.

00:25:22.848 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:84%
That was the root chakra,
the polarity of the chakra.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So did a Merlin as a
character show up at that point

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.960 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.793 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:25:31.793 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:90%
And he was very tough.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that--

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: I don't
remember exactly.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and what
your experience was,

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
because I know some people
were kind of activated,

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.273 align:middle line:84%
some were agitated,
people were reacting.

00:25:40.273 --> 00:25:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah,
some of them were crying.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were--

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
because he started to say
very deep, dark things

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:90%
of their souls.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:84%
He started to say,
going to the point

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.640 align:middle line:90%
of where the pattern started.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:90%
And that usually is a trauma.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So as he was walking
around, he used

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
to whisper things in
the ears of the people

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to the pattern
that they were holding onto.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And that was basically
one of the things

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.987 align:middle line:84%
that moved many people
because it was like--

00:26:15.987 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Acknowledge
the trauma right out.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.737 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:26:18.737 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Acknowledge this.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:90%
This is your pattern.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.710 align:middle line:90%
You have been designed for this.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:90%
So face it.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to change it?

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to change
the perception of it?

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very
tough talk about,

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:84%
can you see that
you are actually not

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:84%
willing to change that
because otherwise you

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:84%
don't exist anymore as
you think who you are.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
your identity, yeah.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO:
It's your identity.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Your trauma is your identity.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you want a new life, face
it and make of it a tool and not

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:90%
your essence.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:90%
So it was very, very tough.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did that
affect you as well?

00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Did you--

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.325 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah,
of course, of course.

00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.408 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
get too personal,

00:27:02.408 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:90%
but what did it bring up in you?

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO:
Well, for example,

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:15.230 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that I had
as a pattern is that because I

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a father in my
life, I tried to be the father

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:24.870 align:middle line:84%
of many, trying to replace
that role that I didn't have.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So instead of looking for
that, what I started to do

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:90%
is to try to--

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.745 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Become a father.

00:27:31.745 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: --become
a father to guide people,

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%
to teach people to,
this kind of things.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So he was taking me to
the trauma of saying,

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing?

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.400 align:middle line:84%
You are trying to
replace someone?

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:90%
You are trying to do something.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very
tough for me to say,

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I know that your pattern took
you to be in the center, but is

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.428 align:middle line:90%
that your right place?

00:27:57.428 --> 00:27:58.470 align:middle line:90%
So you actually want to--

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it brought up the
wound of not having a father.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
So it was like taking me to
rethink the way in which I

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:90%
do things in life.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Interesting because
it really the Merlin as figures

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:18.410 align:middle line:84%
are types of fathers that you're
connecting with and working with

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.690 align:middle line:84%
as you help guide
others as well.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So they almost provide a
father-like figure for you

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:24.930 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Totally.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:90%
They are like that.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And they were
basically-- were saying,

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:36.700 align:middle line:84%
we are teaching you this
in order for you to become,

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.110 align:middle line:84%
in reality, what you are
supposed to be as a figure.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But before that,
you have to face

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:84%
from where are you doing that,
from which trauma, are you

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.780 align:middle line:90%
doing that.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So you can use
it as a tool and not as a way

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
of escaping or as a way of
controlling just because you

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:00.793 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have it.

00:29:00.793 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the things
that we do in our lives--

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a deep lesson.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.043 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the things
that we do in our lives,

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:11.500 align:middle line:84%
we think that they are
good, but because we

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:18.480 align:middle line:84%
had a trauma that is pushing us
to do the good according to what

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.318 align:middle line:90%
for us was bad but--

00:29:21.318 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's almost
an overcompensation.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So we say, I don't know, I
will give a lot of freedom

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to my children because I didn't
have freedom when I was a child.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And then it turns back
to you with children--

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Throughout
history, generationally,

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:90%
this is how we do it.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So we go into the other
side and the other spectrum.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, and each person had
their own flavor of that.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Of course.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes what I say to the
people I don't remember.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:90%
I can understand that.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:84%
But that's why I asked what
your own experience was

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.527 align:middle line:90%
because that you would know.

00:29:58.527 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Oh yeah,
I went through my own.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when I
finish with the people,

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:13.780 align:middle line:84%
they take me aside or on
a side, and they tell me

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:90%
what I have to do.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to
think about this.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Now you do that.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes-- there
was, I think in this trip,

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:84%
there were some situations in
which I was saying something

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:90%
It was not me.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a Merlin explaining
something to the people.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he
turned back to me

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.150 align:middle line:84%
in that moment and I out loud
said something that hurt me--

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to say, and you have to
pay attention about this,

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.417 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, I'm not exempt.

00:30:46.417 --> 00:30:47.750 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was the father here.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.530 align:middle line:90%
So we're having so much fun.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to have to-- we'll
skip through a couple of these.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.423 align:middle line:84%
But you went to
the druid's temple.

00:30:56.423 --> 00:30:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Where is the druid's temple?

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the people there
thought this was so incredibly

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.190 align:middle line:90%
authentic.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.158 align:middle line:84%
And you did a druidic
ceremony there.

00:31:03.158 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: This
place is amazing.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Where is it?

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.722 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: But
it's not that old.

00:31:06.722 --> 00:31:10.660 align:middle line:84%
It's from the late 18th century,
the beginning of the 19th

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:16.300 align:middle line:84%
century, when the high society
of England started to have this

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.470 align:middle line:84%
renaissance of the
druids' traditions.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So many of them used to gather
to do the druid ceremonies

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.260 align:middle line:90%
And there was one--

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.800 align:middle line:84%
someone that had a lot of money
from that region, I don't who

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.380 align:middle line:90%
he was because it's all--

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:42.730 align:middle line:84%
apparently nobody exactly knows
what is the story of the place.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So apparently this person
that had a lot of money

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and was kind of the
ruler of that territory,

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:84%
he build this temple, which
is the only temple that

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:84%
exists in England related to
the druids, at least today.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:03.720 align:middle line:90%
I have to go there next time.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.235 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: And
it looks like--

00:32:05.235 --> 00:32:06.610 align:middle line:84%
it's in the middle
of the forest.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to take a
walk in the forest.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is it
open to the public.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Can anyone go?

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.865 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: It's
always open at any time.

00:32:11.865 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, that's good.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going there next time.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:14.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: It's
always open at any time,

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.698 align:middle line:84%
but there is barely any sign
that tells you where it is.

00:32:18.698 --> 00:32:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, like a
lot of places in Britain.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I've been so lost
trying to find.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah,
it's very difficult.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They'll have a
sign that points this way

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and the next one
points that way.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly, yeah.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I have been having troubles
with the bus driver

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.470 align:middle line:84%
because I was
telling him this way.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:37.468 align:middle line:84%
You can only get
there to this place.

00:32:37.468 --> 00:32:39.010 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, the GPS
told me this way.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:42.020 align:middle line:84%
No, believe me, I've
been here many times.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I was guiding
the bus drivers.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, trying to
find the Emrys Castle in Wales,

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:84%
which was supposedly
a Merlin's castle.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:90%
It was like that.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.040 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.150 align:middle line:84%
We ended up totally
lost up with some goats.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.480 align:middle line:90%
It's getting dark.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:90%
I never did find it.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Impossible.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah, I sometimes
slept in the middle of nowhere--

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I understand.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: --in the trunk
of the car because of that.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so now
you got into the temple,

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and tell us a little bit about
the experience and why everyone

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.850 align:middle line:90%
thought this feels so real.

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Well, this place,
the druid's temple for me,

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:24.730 align:middle line:84%
represents-- and Brimham rocks
represents the plexus of the--

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.570 align:middle line:90%
England.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's the moment in which the
lower frequencies or the lower

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.335 align:middle line:84%
chakras ends in order to
recognize the inner power,

00:33:34.335 --> 00:33:35.960 align:middle line:90%
oh I am.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you go to the
upper chakras, to the heart.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
happens there then?

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.590 align:middle line:84%
The Druid that showed up or the
Merlin that showed up there,

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.420 align:middle line:84%
what was their
message to you all?

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So his message
basically was related to how do

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:84%
you recognize the inner
power that you have.

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember it.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It was a long time
ago for me, so I don't

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.120 align:middle line:90%
remember what he said exactly.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But I do remember that it was a
ceremony that he held in order

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.679 align:middle line:84%
to weave the net, to
put the apples together

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and saying to remember is to put
the members together, remember.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:25.989 align:middle line:84%
So you have come here to
remember things that have

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.600 align:middle line:90%
been broken in human history.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:34.420 align:middle line:84%
You have come here to bring
back this net to the core.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So you have to face the core
so we could weave the net.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:43.389 align:middle line:84%
And as I was saying
that, he literally,

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:48.889 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that I
am still like, why did I do it,

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:84%
it was not me, but he put
his hand inside the grass

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and under the middle stone that
is there, which represented

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:02.050 align:middle line:84%
the core of the planet, as
we were all around, singing

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and holding with apples.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.918 align:middle line:84%
He put it there and took all
the spiders with his hand.

00:35:08.918 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All this what?

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.365 align:middle line:90%
>> DISTEFANO: Spiders.

00:35:10.365 --> 00:35:11.425 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, spiders.

00:35:11.425 --> 00:35:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah,
which I don't like much.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I don't like spiders.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.663 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Me neither.

00:35:15.663 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But he was very confident
because it was not his body,

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:90%
maybe.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Here's your body.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:21.370 align:middle line:90%
You take--

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.787 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: I took all the
spiders that were down there

00:35:23.787 --> 00:35:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and put them on the
top of the stone.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So they all started
to walk around within.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'd been running.

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So it was
like talking to the spiders,

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and the spiders were going the
direction that he was talking

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.600 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was a magical moment
where everyone started to sing,

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:84%
to connect, to weave their own
net to the center of the planet.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said all of
this that has been spread

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and all the differences
that each one of you have,

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:10.230 align:middle line:84%
they all represent the different
options of only one thing.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you remember them,
you recognize that you're not

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.100 align:middle line:90%
different beings.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.270 align:middle line:84%
You are only one observing
different options.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So bring that vision
back to the center,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.110 align:middle line:90%
so we can weave this back.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And it was like--

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:33.820 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of it was all
these apples or the fruits

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:39.190 align:middle line:84%
or the nodes of the planet
have been activating

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.550 align:middle line:84%
different cultures, different
religions, different traditions,

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and different points of view,
like the nodes that are in China

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.830 align:middle line:84%
are different from the nodes
that are in South America

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and the
Pacific against Africa.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So all the different nodes have
evolved in a different way,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.270 align:middle line:84%
forgetting that they are a part
of only one thing, that they all

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:03.790 align:middle line:84%
belong to the
center of the earth.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So the temple became like
the womb of the planet earth.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And we were there doing
the ceremony to say,

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:84%
transcend your
differences because you

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.560 align:middle line:90%
are going to the heart now.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.620 align:middle line:90%
So we have to weave this.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.627 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's the spider
energy, that creativity.

00:37:20.627 --> 00:37:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
things that happened there.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.043 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
talk about one more.

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:28.460 align:middle line:84%
People are going to have to
watch the series because we're

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.460 align:middle line:84%
not going to get
through all this.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: And I don't
remember every thing.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're
having too much--

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:31.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're having too much fun.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.608 align:middle line:84%
One of your favorite places
was called the Ring of Brodgar.

00:37:35.608 --> 00:37:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah, it's
the last place we went.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Where is that?

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Ring of Brodgar
is one of the last stone circles

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:90%
that is in the Orkney islands.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Orkney islands?

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Orkney islands
in the north of Scotland.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.410 align:middle line:84%
This stone circle
is very particular

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.780 align:middle line:90%
because it looks like a crown.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And you can see the crown.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And in the center,
there are these plants

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:84%
that are always like
in a reddish color.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's red, burgundy color.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.647 align:middle line:90%
And they're only there.

00:38:09.647 --> 00:38:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this was the crown
you were originally referring

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:84%
to when you were looking
at the British Isles.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So
that's the crown chakra.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.150 align:middle line:84%
The Orkney islands are the
crown chakra of Great Britain.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.155 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It seems everyone has
magical things to say about it--

00:38:24.155 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Oh really.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --in general, yes.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:26.705 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Well,
yeah, it's the crown.

00:38:26.705 --> 00:38:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very special.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: It's the portal.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what did
Merlin take you through once you

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.460 align:middle line:90%
got to the crown.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Now we've missed a
bunch of chakras,

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and people have to watch the
series to see the rest of it.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.385 align:middle line:84%
But here we are
at the crown now.

00:38:37.385 --> 00:38:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Many things.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We'll just finish
it off with the crown.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.573 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:38:41.573 --> 00:38:45.530 align:middle line:90%
So that stone circle--

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.122 align:middle line:84%
so the beauty of it is
everything is green.

00:38:48.122 --> 00:38:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly when
you arrive there,

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:54.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a red circle of plants
that grow naturally there.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the stone circle
that looks like a crown.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
middle, you have again,

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:84%
all this red with a cross of
paths that goes to the center.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And the place--
well, what we did

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:13.790 align:middle line:90%
there was to deliver the apples.

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So it was like, OK, the
crown of the planet,

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
which is the crown
of mother earth,

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.680 align:middle line:84%
actually represents the
magnetic North Pole.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a crown
of all the colors

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:29.110 align:middle line:84%
that creates the northern lights
and then the magnetic field.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So this magnetic field that you
can see because of the ions that

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.130 align:middle line:84%
comes from the sun, and
you see all the colors,

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.900 align:middle line:90%
that represent the crown.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And the apples represent
the wisdom, the information

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:84%
that has been growing
inside the planet

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and then goes to humanity.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's when the
person enlightens

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:55.070 align:middle line:84%
itself is the halo that
you can see in the person

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.790 align:middle line:90%
when it ignites.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can call yourself
king or queen in that moment

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.610 align:middle line:84%
because people represent
that with the crown.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But actually it's
the magnetic field

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that we all have
in order to exist.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:90%
So what we did there was to--

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.560 align:middle line:84%
we put together the two
sides, the personality side

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and the essence
side of each apple.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So we repaired or remembered
all the different options.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And once we were
in the crown, we

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:36.240 align:middle line:84%
offered that as a spread
of wisdom for the land.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it was each
person's discovery really

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and mending those
aspects of themselves,

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:84%
bringing them together
that they would offer.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
pretty profound.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:46.563 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:40:46.563 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
an inner process

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:50.550 align:middle line:84%
to work for a
bigger process when

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't know the
story of the other person,

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.770 align:middle line:84%
you are taking
your own part on it

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:57.580 align:middle line:90%
and you get something from that.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: So we were
basically using our own personal

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:05.370 align:middle line:84%
path in order to help
in a collective path.

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're out of time,
but I would like to know before

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.090 align:middle line:84%
we go, what was for you most the
moment that you treasured most

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:90%
on a personal level?

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Well, I think
that was the last moment when we

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.670 align:middle line:90%
put all the apples together.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:24.670 align:middle line:84%
It was freezing,
the coldest weather

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.220 align:middle line:90%
that we had in the entire trip.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's cold up there.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: It was very cold.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:34.210 align:middle line:84%
It was windy and
almost snowy because it

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.890 align:middle line:90%
was ice hitting your skin.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment when we
all put it together, actually

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:47.500 align:middle line:84%
it was the sunrise, which
was my birthday also.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment, the
message that we received

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:59.760 align:middle line:10%
that the Merlin was saying
gave meaning to everything

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.400 align:middle line:10%
that we had been doing,
not only in that trip,

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.460 align:middle line:10%
but in the research
of all the stories.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.770 align:middle line:84%
All the stories
that we have told

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:12.750 align:middle line:84%
are just describing a
natural process of the Earth.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And you are the neurons
telling those stories

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.770 align:middle line:90%
and living those stories.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.500 align:middle line:10%
So follow all those
stories and you

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.220 align:middle line:10%
will recognize how you
are connected to something

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:29.850 align:middle line:10%
that is deeper, that is
not just a story that

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.830 align:middle line:10%
is describing Earth.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:33.900 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That really
settled in that moment.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:39.365 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah, for me,
it was very, oh yeah, this is--

00:42:39.365 --> 00:42:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We did it.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.073 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:42:41.073 --> 00:42:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think people
are going to have

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.993 align:middle line:84%
fun looking at what happened at
the chakras in between as well.

00:42:47.993 --> 00:42:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO: And how I
get weird because I usually

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.250 align:middle line:90%
don't feel that.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.077 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:42:52.077 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The weird part.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DE STEFANO:
I've been followed.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.618 align:middle line:84%
So we get to see
Matias at his weirdest.

00:42:57.618 --> 00:42:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Of course.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:42:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.675 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
sharing all that with us.

00:43:01.675 --> 00:43:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And we look forward
to seeing the series.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>> DE STEFANO: Thank you.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Again, Matias.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.220 align:middle line:90%
His new series is on Gaia.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.730 align:middle line:84%
It's called The Journey to
Remembering now, featuring

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:09.610 align:middle line:90%
season 2.

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:11.640 align:middle line:84%
You can also watch my
previous conversation

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.090 align:middle line:84%
with Matias in the
Open Mind archives.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:90%
