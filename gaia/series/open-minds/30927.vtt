>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The Knight Templar

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
remain, after 900 years,
a mysterious and elusive

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.540 align:middle line:90%
brotherhood.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:10%
They're credited with the
creation of modern day banking

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:10%
but equally with the
protection of a holy bloodline

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:10%
with an undisclosed secret,
which every knight swore

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:10%
to protect with their life--
and of course, the grail.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:10%
In truth, this group of warrior
monks has complex roots.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Their behavior
resembles those who

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
are steeped in the
mysteries traditions

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and secret spiritual doctrines
common to esoteric cults

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:90%
of Europe and the Middle East.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:10%
Author Freddy Silva now
shows that their story

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:10%
is far broader in scope
than we had thought.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:90%
And he's with us here today.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to be talking
to someone, finally,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:84%
about this story because
it's actually quite relevant.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:84%
People think of this
as something relegated

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:84%
to times 1,000 years
ago when, in fact, some

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
might say it's alive
and well today.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Yes, it is.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.111 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the Templars along
with other esoteric groups

00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:10%
because there were two groups.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:10%
There was an exterior
component of the Templars

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:10%
who did mundane things.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:10%
They did the fighting.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.487 align:middle line:84%
They did the fetching water
and all that kind of thing.

00:01:21.487 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you had the
inner brotherhood

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
who were very much a spiritual
brotherhood who were following

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.050 align:middle line:84%
traditions of esoteric
groups, gnostic societies.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.470 align:middle line:10%
And these people, as far
back as the Egyptians,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:10%
they're basically following
the aims of every single person

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:10%
on the planet, even today, which
is the aspiration of the soul.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:10%
What it means to be alive.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:10%
What it means to understand
the nature of the universe

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.612 align:middle line:10%
and what it is that
you're doing here.

00:01:46.612 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were following
these traditions.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.278 align:middle line:84%
You could actually say
that all of these people

00:01:50.278 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:84%
were following a
sort of a covenant

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:90%
that everyone aspires to.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the thing
that we ultimately aspire to

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
is self empowerment,
which can be

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
a very bad thing
in some circles.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can be a bad thing.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's still the thing
that everyone watching

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.681 align:middle line:84%
this interview right now is
looking for in their own lives.

00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
we're here for.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.330 align:middle line:84%
That is the human journey,
which has been kept away

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.320 align:middle line:84%
from the people for
a very long time.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And when we get a little
further into the conversation,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to talk about that
aspect of why you think

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:84%
it is it has been throughout
the ages pushed down

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.407 align:middle line:84%
and away from the people at
large to know the great secrets

00:02:27.407 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:90%
and mysteries.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
the mystery here

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:90%
is how did you end up in this?

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:90%
This is a scholarly work.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
One could spend weeks
studying this book.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I couldn't.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I could only get so far
in a short amount of time.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And thank God
you're able to help

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:90%
clarify some things for me.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I'll send
you the CliffsNotes.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
I could've appreciated it.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a lot to take in.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.872 align:middle line:84%
But how did you get involved
with something of this nature?

00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people know you
for your work in crop circles.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was-- Actually,
ironically, it was with my work

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.869 align:middle line:84%
with crop circles and also
with sacred science that

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
helped me to actually
understand the deeper

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:90%
mysteries of the Templars.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Hadn't I done that
work before, I

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.090 align:middle line:84%
would have written an
ordinary Templar book.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So in hindsight, it actually
helped me quite a lot.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And how it really
started was really I--

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm Portuguese by birth, as
you can tell by my accent.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So I want to find out
what was the connection

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:84%
between the Templars
and my country's history

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
because people do know that
the Templars were involved

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Some know more than others.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, it's just a
sort of intangible story.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.345 align:middle line:84%
And I began to probe into very
ancient texts about connections

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:84%
with the Templars,
when were they there,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
what were they doing, where
were they doing it and how.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
the whole story

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
takes on this huge sort of
complex circumstance were

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I began to realize what it
was that they were doing

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:84%
in Portugal and why
they went there.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.941 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
native land really plays

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.315 align:middle line:90%
central to the theme-- Portugal.

00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which that's
not a part of the story

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:90%
I had ever heard before.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.708 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: No, and
neither has anybody else

00:03:58.708 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:90%
until I put it into a book.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of
this stuff is either

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
in old manuscripts, which
aren't even written on paper.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
They're written on
animal skin by monks

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
who did nothing
except write a lot.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And the other part of the story
is that a lot of these texts

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:90%
are forgotten.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
They've been hidden away in
monasteries and libraries.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be kind
of persistent to find out

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:90%
the source of this information.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And once I figured
that out and located

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:84%
the source of these
manuscripts, there's

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:90%
a different story that came out.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
connections began

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
to open in terms of
their relationship

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:90%
to esoteric societies.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
What they were
doing, for example,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
with the lineages of Mary
Magdalene and John the Baptist.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And both of their feast
days are the feast days

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
of the independence of Portugal
as a country and its setting

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:90%
up as a nation state.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.014 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's highly coincidental.

00:04:49.014 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, or not.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They also built a lot
of churches there dedicated

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:84%
to Mary Magdalene
and John the Baptist.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a
disproportionate amount.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
story began to roll

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.575 align:middle line:84%
into this more
esoteric component.

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:02.158 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
not what we know.

00:05:02.158 --> 00:05:03.611 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the average
person that's

00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
heard or read anything about
it is thinking of it more

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:84%
in terms of Jerusalem and
of a band of warrior knights

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:84%
that were protecting pilgrims
on their way to the holy site.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that for a minute.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Is there any truth in that?

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, even Discovery
Channel and other programs

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.777 align:middle line:90%
still put this out there.

00:05:25.777 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it's
kind of unfortunate.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:84%
We tend, in the 20th
century-- actually,

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
no, we're in the 21st
now-- 21st century

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to actually take
things very literally.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:84%
In their day, things were
taken metaphorically and

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:90%
allegorically.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
You got to look at
things as symbols.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:90%
So, the story--

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I put it to you--
the story of nine men

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to patrol a 33
mile route from sea

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to shrine in Jerusalem, which
had to contend with Saracens,

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
bandits, outlaws,
and mountain lions

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:84%
to protect tens of
thousands of pilgrims.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:90%
It's preposterous.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a smokescreen.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And besides, for 40 years
before the Templars were even

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
a glint in the eye
Hugues de Payens,

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
the grandmaster, the
protection of the pilgrims

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
is already established by
the Knight Hospitallers,

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:84%
which people tend to associate
with the Knights Templar.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
They were sister organizations,
but they came first.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:84%
They're known by many
names and these orders

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
seem to, somehow, interse-- in
your book, they do intersect.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
We have the Knights
Hospitallers.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.254 align:middle line:90%
We have the Knight Templar.

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
We have the order
of the knights--

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.586 align:middle line:90%
order of the Templars.

00:06:30.586 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:90%
We have the order of Sion.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.157 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us an
idea of what these--

00:06:36.157 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this is
the right time in our talk

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.930 align:middle line:84%
to do this-- the origins
of each of these groups--

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the commonly known
groups-- so we can see

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
that this story actually
is quite muddled.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's very muddled.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the first six
months of my research, which

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.360 align:middle line:84%
covered 15 years-- that's a
lot of time for research--

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I was spent, basically, taking
apart all of these threads

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.050 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how did they
all come together and become

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.692 align:middle line:90%
so muddled.

00:06:59.692 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
the Knights Hospitaller

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
were already created
by a group of merchants

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
from Italy to
protect the pilgrims

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and set up hospitals
for the poor

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.240 align:middle line:84%
who basically traveled all the
way from the sea to Jerusalem.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were basically
being killed on route

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:84%
or left to fend for themselves
on the side of the road.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
In 1100 when Jerusalem
basically is taken over

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:84%
by Godfrey de Bouillon
and the Crusaders,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
he installs another
group of knights

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:84%
in the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea of
going on the crusade

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.167 align:middle line:84%
was to liberate the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre.

00:07:32.167 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:84%
That was also a bit
of a smoke screen.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Liberate it from?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The Arabs who had
taken over the whole city.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.821 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There had
been Moorish invasions.

00:07:38.821 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.335 align:middle line:84%
Then you have another
group of knights--

00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:84%
just to make the
story even more easy--

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that Godfrey de
Bouillon installs

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
on Mount Sion in
a ruined basilica

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.796 align:middle line:84%
that he rebuilds and
then goes and lives

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
in outside the protective
walls of Jerusalem, which

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:90%
is a bad idea for king to do.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So he installs these 12
monks and also 12 knights.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And they became known
as the order of Sion.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you have Hugues
de Payens, who

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
shows up in 1104,
four years later.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And then he starts another
group of what I call the proto

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Templars because the Templars
really only date from 1118,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:90%
officially speaking.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He ends up in the
Church of Holy Sepulchre,

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:84%
basically, living there
with another group

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
of disparate knights who's
trying to recruit people.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
confusion really begins.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.888 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre-- this

00:08:28.888 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
has to be going back then to
the bloodline of Mary and Jesus.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre, I assume--

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Was very important
in the whole proceedings.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes because, I
mean, the remains of Jesus

00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:84%
are thought to be in
the Church of the Holy

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.257 align:middle line:84%
Sepulchre in the old city
of Jerusalem still, right?

00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.465 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Even though
the Indians will

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:84%
say that that's not the
case, maybe somewhere

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:90%
in southern India.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
might be a good time

00:08:56.748 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:84%
to just establish
a little bit of why

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
that was so important--
that location.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think it was more
of a symbol that was actually--

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
if you take the story back
another 40 years to about 1060,

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
you have a group of monks
that shows up mysteriously

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
from Sicily in the
middle of what was then

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.955 align:middle line:84%
a French kingdom called
Champagne and also what would,

00:09:17.955 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:90%
today, we would call Belgium.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
They show up in this
little town called Orval.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
called Peter the Hermit.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful fellow.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful characters.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very great character.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Walter the Penniless.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.551 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Walter the
Penniless, my favorite.

00:09:30.551 --> 00:09:32.135 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they
basically were nobles

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
who'd renounced all of their
worldly possessions to go.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to have a more
mystical experience of God.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
They felt that the
Catholic church, which

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
was very dominant at the
time, had lost the plot.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
They had basically created
this false impression

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
live it differently.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So Peter the Hermit
and his monks

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:84%
show up at Orval where a very
young Godfrey de Bouillon was

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:84%
living, still had
no idea that he's

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:84%
going to be king of
Jerusalem one day.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
tutored him in the ways

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of the order of Sion, and
they called it by that name.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And their idea and they
said quite clearly--

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and this is a stated aim of
that order from the period--

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
that their idea was
to reestablish and put

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:84%
on the throne a holy
blood line that dated back

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
to the Merovingian
kings of central Europe,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:84%
that date all the way
back to King David,

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and all the way back to
Troy-- the House of Troy.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.245 align:middle line:84%
So the King David
bloodline, of course,

00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:84%
is the bloodline that eventually
ends up with John the Baptist,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.817 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene and,
of course, Jesus.

00:10:32.817 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what
about the bloodline

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:90%
of Godfrey de Bouillon?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He was a
Merovingian, as well.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's
where the order of Sion

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Merovingian
suddenly connect.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:10%
And Godfrey de
Bouillon, basically,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:10%
is set up or helped to
become one of the trusted

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle line:10%
leaders of the expedition
of the First Crusade

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:10%
to go and liberate the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.306 align:middle line:10%
from the Arabs.

00:10:54.306 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So an
interesting thing

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.888 align:middle line:84%
when we're looking at, sort
of, the moral and ethical

00:10:57.888 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
background here is a lot of
people think of the Templars

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
as the ones who started
the banking industry who

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
were the protectorates
and, ultimately, thieves

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:84%
of massive amounts of treasure
and gold and so forth.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And then here we
hear the other part,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:84%
which is these were
ascetics who were highly

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
ordered toward
maintaining the secrets

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and living by very strict,
very highly moral doctrines.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.411 align:middle line:90%
Who were they?

00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the victors
always rewrite

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:90%
the history in their own words.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
victors were the pope

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.002 align:middle line:84%
and Phillip the
fourth of France.

00:11:29.002 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the impression
that we're left with.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:90%
These people were greedy.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
They were, basically, doing
all kinds of abominable things.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they did get
greedy in the end

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.926 align:middle line:84%
because as any large
organization that grows out

00:11:39.926 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:84%
of control, it
eventually becomes

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:84%
corrupt somewhere
along the line.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:90%
But that was very much later on.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.840 align:middle line:84%
The beginning stages
of the Templar order

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:90%
is very different.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a
spiritual brotherhood,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:84%
which is composed
of two sections.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The people that did the mundane
stuff, the outer brotherhood.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.975 align:middle line:84%
And out of those
people, there were

00:11:56.975 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:84%
a few that were
chosen as people who

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
seem to be responsible enough to
know a deeper secret knowledge.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were indoctrinated
into an inner brotherhood.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is all documented, and
particularly so in Portugal,

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:84%
where they would
then be observed

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:84%
for over the course of a year
to see if they could actually

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
carry these mysteries with them
and never divulge the secrets.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:10%
Every person that joined the
inner Templar brotherhood

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:10%
swore, on pain of death, never
to divulge these secrets.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:10%
And most of them died taking
the secrets to the grave.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:10%
So some of the knights
that were actually

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.065 align:middle line:10%
helped by the holy
inquisition, they

00:12:33.065 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:10%
suggested that the secret
was spiritual in nature.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And even the King of France was
not privy to that information.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And should he be privy,
he would be killed, too.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're dealing with people
who are following a very

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
ancient doctrine of mystical
interpretation and experience

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
We could call it a shamanic
experience, if you like.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at where the
Templars got the information

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.792 align:middle line:84%
from and how they
behaved, for example, when

00:12:56.792 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle line:90%
they were in Jerusalem.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.584 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly did a lot
of digging in their years

00:13:00.584 --> 00:13:01.125 align:middle line:90%
in Jerusalem.

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: I mean,
never in the years

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.750 align:middle line:10%
in Temple Mount did
they ever once leave

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.861 align:middle line:10%
Temple Mount to actually
go and help out pilgrims,

00:13:07.861 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:10%
but they did a lot of digging.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lot of digging.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And this has
been proved, as well.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And in the two years after
they arrived, one of them

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
is a document that is going
back to what was then Belgium,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
or would have been later
Belgium, with some scrolls.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.471 align:middle line:84%
And these scrolls were
found on the Temple Mount.

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
they were discovered

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.011 align:middle line:84%
to have been written by
the Essene community that

00:13:28.011 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
had lived on Mount
Sion and Temple Mount.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And these people, if
you follow their story,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
clearly show that they
wore the same white mantles

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:90%
as the Knights Templar.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
They followed the same ascetic
behavior as the Templars.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.110 align:middle line:84%
They also ritually bathed
as in the tradition

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:90%
of John the Baptist.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And they also followed the same
initiation rites of something

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.901 align:middle line:84%
that they called the
raising from the dead.

00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars
did the same thing.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing sinister
about it, by the way.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So if you
look at the Templars'

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
behavior and the
behavior of the Essenes

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and other esoteric
groups at that period,

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
it's quite clear that
the inner brotherhood was

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:05.985 align:middle line:90%
doing something very different.

00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is bringing
something very, very ancient

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
speaking about that,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about
the Temple Mount.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Temple Mount supposedly
has within it, or did

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.650 align:middle line:84%
have within it at one
point, the Ben Ben,

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.855 align:middle line:84%
which was the very top stone
of the great pyramid, right?

00:14:20.855 --> 00:14:23.145 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's one
of the claims, yes.

00:14:23.145 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that's
not a coincidence,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I assume, that that's
there and all these orders

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:90%
have sprung up around it.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.845 align:middle line:84%
That was a very
important artifact.

00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, very much so.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.127 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to the
concept of sacred space.

00:14:34.127 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Every sacred
site on the face

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, and
particularly the older ones--

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
where the pyramids
of Giza are built,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem, the foundation
for Stonehenge,

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and so forth--
all of these sites

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.672 align:middle line:84%
are proven to exist at the
crossroad of what they call

00:14:51.672 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
the Earth telluric
energy currents.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
includes the Temple Mount?

00:14:54.235 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you can
see these areas

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
as big junction
boxes for the Earth's

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
frequencies and rhythms.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.724 align:middle line:84%
This has been
proved beyond doubt.

00:15:05.724 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite clear as to
whether the Templars were

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.723 align:middle line:84%
following this tradition
wherever they built

00:15:09.723 --> 00:15:12.170 align:middle line:84%
their temples, as well,
also at the intersecting

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
lines of these
telluric currents.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why we fight
so much about them

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and why they're so special.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Baghdad also happens to
be on a similar site.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:90%
We fight about that, as well.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes, after
a while, when people

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:84%
lose the plot and
all of this stuff

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:84%
becomes superstition
or mumbo jumbo,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
we begin to fight over these
spaces for military reasons

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:90%
or for financial reasons.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we are today.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:84%
We've lost that
spiritual connection

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:90%
with these ancient sacred sites.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.386 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even
back then, they

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:84%
were losing it
because they were also

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with the
court-- the Papal Court.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
They were also
interfacing with royalty.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
the papacy was interfacing

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
with the origins of
the knight Templar.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we need to
start going into some

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.882 align:middle line:84%
of the actual players, including
one of the most famous, Hugues.

00:16:03.882 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yes.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so how
does the church--

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
how did the Roman Catholic
Church interface with

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.544 align:middle line:84%
or what did it have to do with
the origins of the Templars?

00:16:15.544 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, when I was doing
the research for the book,

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
surprised to find out

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
that the church
was, pretty much,

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:90%
oblivious to what was going on.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
They thought that all the
knights that Pope Urban had

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
sent on crusade to
the Jerusalem were

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
fighting for good
old mother church.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
the characters involved

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:84%
in the Templar mystery were
actually using it as an excuse

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
to go to Jerusalem to set
up a completely different

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:84%
situation-- part of
which, of course--

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.439 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unbeknownst
to the church.

00:16:40.439 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Unbeknownst to them.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And the order that was set
up in Jerusalem, of course,

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:84%
became the order of
Sion, which becomes

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
a major player and
a major contributor

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:90%
to the Templar movement.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The church is completely
oblivious to this.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.590 align:middle line:84%
They thought that
they basically went

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:84%
there to establish the supreme
role of the Catholic Church

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem, which
to a degree they did.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Crusaders were for.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
But the Crusaders are
not Templars, you see.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.516 align:middle line:90%
That's another point.

00:17:04.516 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's another
confused point, yes.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.367 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And of course,
back in those days,

00:17:09.367 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:90%
the popes didn't last very long.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:84%
So depending on who was
actually in the seat

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
also guided and determined
how much of the Templar story

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
got out and how much of
it was kept underground.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So by the time we
get to about, say

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.690 align:middle line:84%
1136, one of the main
benefactors of the Templars

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
who was an incredible man
called Bernard of Clairvaux--

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
the leader of the Cistercian
monks-- to whom they pledged

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.835 align:middle line:84%
allegiance, by the
way; not to the pope;

00:17:33.835 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
to the Cistercian
order-- in '36,

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
he maneuvers to
have a Cistercian

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:90%
monk to become the pope.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So during his tenure, which
I think took some 15 years--

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Powerful man.

00:17:48.035 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh!

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
When he gets into the seat
of the pope in the Vatican

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
in 1139, suddenly the
first thing he does

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is he issues one of the greatest
papal bulls in history, which

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
basically makes the Templars
an international organization

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:90%
bound to nobody but the pope.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
But since the pope
is a Cistercian,

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.760 align:middle line:84%
the Templars may as well have
been obliging the Cistercians

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So during his tenure,
they had complete reign

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever they wanted
and, of course, they did.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, let's
start taking the story--

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.474 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, let's
go to Hugues de Payens.

00:18:22.474 --> 00:18:23.474 align:middle line:90%
How do you say his name?

00:18:23.474 --> 00:18:23.861 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Hugues de Payens.

00:18:23.861 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Payens.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:90%
Hugues de Payens.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to Hugues--
because that's

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:84%
the name that most people see
in relationship to the Templar.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.947 align:middle line:84%
If they start looking it up, his
name comes up almost right off.

00:18:31.947 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Central key figure to the
creation of the Templars.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Hardly anything is
known about him.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.349 align:middle line:90%
Total mystery.

00:18:39.349 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:84%
A number of reasons-- one
of them because so many

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.195 align:middle line:84%
of the documents
have been destroyed.

00:18:43.195 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're left with these
little bits of information

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:90%
that we can draw from.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle line:90%
We know he was a minor noble.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:84%
He lived in the Burgundy area
of what would then become France

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:90%
around the area of the Dijon.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:90%
He renounces his wealth.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
His father was of Middle Eastern
origin, which is incredible.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So he actually had an idea
of what the Arabs were doing,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He had an
affinity for the Arab--

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, very
sophisticated culture

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.890 align:middle line:90%
in the day.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.389 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were
light-years ahead

00:19:12.389 --> 00:19:13.925 align:middle line:90%
of where Europe was at the time.

00:19:13.925 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Europeans
would be considered barbaric

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.370 align:middle line:90%
by their standards.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And he spent some time
in the Middle East.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:84%
He shows up in 1104 in
Jerusalem just after it's

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.647 align:middle line:84%
been reconquered, befriends
the new king of Jerusalem,

00:19:28.647 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:84%
meets a whole bunch of people
from his part of the world

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
in France there,
and that's where

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
the seeds of all of
these ideas of creating

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:84%
a new temple Jerusalem,
a kingdom of conscience,

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in Europe as far
away from Rome as could be had.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
that seed comes in.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:84%
He becomes the
first person really

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, instead of
just liberating Jerusalem,

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.120 align:middle line:84%
why don't we create a
kingdom of conscience

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.345 align:middle line:84%
based on the ideal
of what Jerusalem is.

00:19:52.345 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he really sounds
like he's bringing in-- now

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:84%
we're going beyond
ethics and morals.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.927 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
genuine esoteric science.

00:20:00.927 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.426 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lineage
of esoteric science,

00:20:03.426 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:84%
which is coming through
the Arabic world, which

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.845 align:middle line:84%
has its roots in Egypt and
perhaps even beyond then,

00:20:08.845 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're
talking about, in the day,

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
the Arab culture was what
was essentially lending

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to the planet great
architecture, mathematics,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:90%
geometry, poetry, astronomy.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So Hugues is the one
that was the carrier

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.572 align:middle line:84%
of that part of the story
early on-- the seed of that.

00:20:31.572 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, he got it.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you put him together
with Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.600 align:middle line:84%
the two basically had exactly
the same idea, as well.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
Bernard a little bit.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.232 align:middle line:84%
Where he came from,
what's up with Bernard?

00:20:43.232 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, fascinating guy.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He is.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I plowed through
500 of his available letters.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.702 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all,
how did that happen?

00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I live in
Maine in winter.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of time in
your hands in Maine in winter.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.841 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah but still.

00:20:56.841 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:84%
How did they end up, A,
in Maine or near Maine?

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And were these also
written on animal skins

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:02.980 align:middle line:90%
or were these on parchments?

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: No, they've
all been published.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:90%
It's no secret.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They've
all been published.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I just
wanted to know,

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.758 align:middle line:84%
I think you can tell
a lot about a person

00:21:08.758 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
by the private correspondence
that they share with people.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So I figured I should go
for this incredible exercise

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:84%
to get under the skin
of this guy who's

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:84%
so prominent in
the Templar story.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he doesn't
get much attention.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:84%
He is seen as the abbot
of the Cistercian monks.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:90%
A great-- how should I say?

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.900 align:middle line:84%
He basically reformed the
Catholic church in his own way

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
because he's so
influential in the way

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
that popes and bishops
would see the world

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and respected their
office by showing

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:90%
how badly they were behaving.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.384 align:middle line:90%
So he was a huge figurehead.

00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So once you start looking
at Bernard Clairvaux

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and looking at what he
was actually thinking,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.396 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
someone who really wanted

00:21:48.396 --> 00:21:50.900 align:middle line:84%
to practice the original
Christian values, which

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:90%
precede Christianity.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're more like
Essene or Mandaean or even

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Zoroastrian values.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
These are things
which are concurrent

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:84%
in every esoteric culture going
way back into the Egyptians.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was love
of brotherhood, generosity,

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:90%
charity, and tell a few more.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Equality.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:08.281 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Equality.

00:22:08.281 --> 00:22:09.937 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They viewed
women as equal.

00:22:09.937 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The Cistercians
worked alongside the poor

00:22:13.545 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:90%
in the fields.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:84%
They taught them how
to read and write.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:84%
They offered hospitals so
when the poor got sick,

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
they would treat them.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:84%
They would give them land
so they could till it.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.750 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they gave
them self empowerment.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.333 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: In 12th century Europe,
that's a very dangerous thing

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.537 align:middle line:84%
because the order of the
day didn't want that self

00:22:32.537 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
empowerment to come into
play because the Catholic

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:84%
church assumed that it
had the rightful claim,

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.300 align:middle line:84%
being God's representative here
Earth, to self empowerment.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.300 align:middle line:84%
You had to go through an
intermediary, a bishop,

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:84%
or a priest, tell
them your problems,

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, well, 15
Hail Marys, and now you're OK.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these ascetic
monks were saying no?

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they and the
Templars cut around that.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we
have found something

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:84%
of such incredible spiritual
belief, an incredible doctrine

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.510 align:middle line:84%
written in these scrolls
what we found on the Temple

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Mount, which go back
thousands of years.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to practice this.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's a spiritual philosophy.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And if adhere to these
principles and you

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
could be honorable
enough to follow them,

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:84%
you are going to have a
kind of shamanic journey.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
To cut a very long
story short, you

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.780 align:middle line:84%
will experience a mystical
revelation of God.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And that knowledge will
bring you enlightenment.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And through that enlightenment,
self empowerment.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:90%
That's bad news for the church.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
it set the Templars up

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:84%
against the Catholic
Church in the first place.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the
history of Europe at the time

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and consequently
since, all the sects

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.180 align:middle line:84%
that were associated with
the Templars-- Cathars,

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Bogomils, everybody-- they
were all decimated by Rome

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
because they were following
exactly the same doctrine.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, they also
held Mary Magdalene

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:84%
as being the carrier
of this bloodline

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and the secret traditions
of the Merovingian kings.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So you see where these
trails are beginning

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:84%
to have undercurrents throughout
all the esoteric groups.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.793 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I'm
looking for reading your book.

00:24:02.793 --> 00:24:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to find these
early connecting points in it.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is, to me, one of
the primary connecting points

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:84%
right there that you
were just talking about

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:84%
is this whole notion of the
self empowerment of the masses.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's go into the
Portuguese part of the story

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:84%
because most people are not
associating sacred places

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and knight Templar
with Portugal.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it appears that,
perhaps, the most sacred space

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.291 align:middle line:84%
of all for the Templars
may have been in Portugal.

00:24:32.291 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I think it was.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now I'm
going to let you just

00:24:34.915 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:84%
tell this story because only
you know to weave this together.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:90%
It's so complex.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's
incredibly complex.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It requires almost a
mathematical precision

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.800 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
whole thing, which

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
is why I wrote the
whole book like a play,

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
in short little bits
to help you through it.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you can just
stick through it,

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:90%
it's very enlightening.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.561 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It all
comes together, yes.

00:24:58.561 --> 00:25:00.992 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I had no idea,
too, that this country that I

00:25:00.992 --> 00:25:02.575 align:middle line:84%
was born in held
such a big secret.

00:25:02.575 --> 00:25:04.200 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you
got to ask yourself

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:84%
is why do a group of
knights go all the way

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:84%
from central Europe, all
the way through Jerusalem,

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.577 align:middle line:84%
end up 2,000 miles away creating
Europe's first nation state.

00:25:13.577 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, why?

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.727 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That was-- it
just didn't compute.

00:25:16.727 --> 00:25:17.810 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't get further away
from Rome in Europe in that day

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:90%
than going to Western Europe.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And back then, it was
basically a tiny little county

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:90%
called Portucale.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:90%
It was named after a seaport.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And the story begins when a
young knight from Burgundy--

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Henry of Burgundy-- goes over
to help the count of Spain

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
get rid of a lot of people
from the Arab world who

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:90%
had taken over his kingdom.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.580 align:middle line:90%
He is given a plot of land.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:84%
He then goes on to
pilgrimage to Jerusalem

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.460 align:middle line:84%
where he meets Hugues de Payens
and the King of Jerusalem.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.345 align:middle line:84%
He goes to Portugal,
brings back the cloak

00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of Mary Magdalene
and other relics.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.117 align:middle line:90%
So obviously he was trusted.

00:25:58.117 --> 00:26:00.033 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he would
be because they're all

00:26:00.033 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
coming from the same
point in France,

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:07.164 align:middle line:84%
or what would become France
but it didn't exist back then.

00:26:07.164 --> 00:26:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Then-- and this
is where the story

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:84%
becomes very exciting-- he
also took with him a young lad

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
from Portugal all
the way to Jerusalem,

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Pedro Arnaldo,
who then ingratiates himself

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:84%
to the King of Jerusalem
and Hugues de Payens.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And a few years later, he shows
up joining a group of monks

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:84%
in the basilica of Mount Sion
that the King of Jerusalem

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:29.910 align:middle line:90%
has set up.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have this man who travels
with the count of Portucale

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
to Jerusalem, becomes
the abbot and the head

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:84%
of the head of
the order of Sion.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And in 1116, I found a charter
written on animal skin.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:84%
A charter where he and Hugues
de Payens are the cosignatories.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And they express, and I
quote, that "Great relations

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.110 align:middle line:84%
are established between
our two orders."

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is 1116.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.020 align:middle line:90%
The Templars don't exist.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So what organization
was Hugues de Payens

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
already the head of
two years before he

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be the head
of the Knights Templar?

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Big mystery.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, this eventually goes
on another nine years.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And in 1125, another
significant charter

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.764 align:middle line:84%
pops up where the two same
people, Prior Arnaldo, as he

00:27:19.764 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:84%
became known, and
Hugues de Payens, again,

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:84%
sign another
charter again saying

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:84%
that their two orders
are in total agreement

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.239 align:middle line:84%
and they are forming
a friendship.

00:27:29.239 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:84%
This is still three years before
the Templars become official

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.450 align:middle line:90%
in the eyes of the pope.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after that
charter was written,

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Hugues de Payens is
documented in Portugal

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:90%
by the Cistercian monks.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And I can almost quote
this from memory.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Hugues de Payens issues
orders to five Templar knights

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to sail from
Jerusalem to Portucale

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.870 align:middle line:90%
to establish a Portuguese crown.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
this Prior Arnaldo,

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
who not only now is the
head of the order of Sion,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:90%
he is also a Templar procurator.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:84%
He has the power to buy
property in Portucale

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.075 align:middle line:84%
and establish a home for the
temple in that territory.

00:28:07.075 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us a little
bit about the order of Sion.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And does this have anything
to do with Dan Brown's books

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.729 align:middle line:84%
that people are familiar
with, "The Priory de Sion,"

00:28:15.729 --> 00:28:16.270 align:middle line:90%
and all that?

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes?

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So tells us a little
bit about them.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.790 align:middle line:84%
What was their purpose
and their charter?

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.522 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's very interesting.

00:28:22.522 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And I have to
basically give credit

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.580 align:middle line:84%
to the writers of "Holy Blood
and Holy Grail" for this

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:84%
because they did
all the legwork,

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.594 align:middle line:84%
which eventually Dan Brown
extracts the information from.

00:28:31.594 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So Baigent
and Leigh, who

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.360 align:middle line:84%
looked at the information
behind the order of Sion,

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:84%
they actually found written
documentation in France, which

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
survives to this day that
proves that this order existed,

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:90%
de facto.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So when the debunking comes
around on the Discovery Channel

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and other places
we won't mention

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:90%
that this whole thing was--

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was mythological.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --made by two
Frenchman as a joke is nonsense

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:84%
because they're actually
established even

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:90%
by the French police in 1956.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So if they're established
by the French police

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:84%
as the Priory of Sion in 1956,
clearly that organization

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:90%
is real.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:84%
The two orders-- the Priory
of Sion and the order of Sion

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.820 align:middle line:84%
basically exchanged
names around about 1180.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
There was an actual
ceremony where

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
they decided to part ways
with the Knights Templar

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.475 align:middle line:84%
because they felt that
the origins of the Templar

00:29:19.475 --> 00:29:20.640 align:middle line:90%
had been betrayed.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:84%
The corruption had
begin to set in.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.960 align:middle line:84%
It was growing in leaps and
bounds, how could it not?

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The checks and balances
weren't coming into place.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back to the
origins of the order of Sion,

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:84%
a group of monks--
ascetics-- who

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.480 align:middle line:84%
want to basically replace
the bloodline of Europe

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.730 align:middle line:84%
back on the throne, which was
lost when the Merovingians lost

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the plot somewhere,
mostly at the connivance

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:90%
of certain people in Rome.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Their stated aim was to put
back the Merovingian bloodline

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.306 align:middle line:84%
on the throne of Jerusalem,
which of course they succeeded

00:29:51.306 --> 00:29:52.680 align:middle line:84%
when they put
Godfrey of Bouillon

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:84%
as the first king of
Jerusalem, and now Merovingian.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And the other stated aim
was that, basically, they

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:84%
wanted to establish a kingdom
of conscience, as well.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:84%
A rightful kingdom where
the real properties

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Baptist, Mary
Magdalene, the Essenes, all

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:84%
of these spiritual sects
could be held together

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
with great esteem and practiced,
literally, not as the Catholic

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Church had begun to do.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.150 align:middle line:84%
They had basically
thwarted and distorted

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.300 align:middle line:84%
the teachings of Jesus
and all of those people.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they were
spiritually in alignment

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.250 align:middle line:84%
then with the new
growing Templars?

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Totally.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So now we have the
head of the order of Sion

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
as a Templar in
Portucale establishing

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.370 align:middle line:84%
ties, close relationships
in that part

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:40.430 align:middle line:84%
of the world in this little
county, no bigger than, say,

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.070 align:middle line:90%
maybe Greater New York.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.530 align:middle line:10%
And slowly, quietly,
they began acquiring

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.630 align:middle line:10%
major little properties
around this city called Braga.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the oldest
cities in Europe.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.720 align:middle line:10%
It's older than
London, Paris, Rome.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.840 align:middle line:10%
Settled by the Trojans from
which the Merovingian bloodline

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:10%
comes from, ironically.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, without
even blinking,

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:84%
the Templars have amassed
more property in Portucale

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:84%
faster than any other
place in Europe.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.704 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were gifted
a great deal of it though.

00:31:08.704 --> 00:31:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It was not as
though they took it.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.661 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And if there were really nine
knights, as the myth goes,

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.637 align:middle line:84%
I could safely say that it
wasn't the threat of violence

00:31:17.637 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
that motivated people to
hand over their property.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.930 align:middle line:84%
They must have been offering
something of tremendous value

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:84%
beyond-- something that
was so inconceivable to us

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.590 align:middle line:84%
that people just
said, yes, please.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Take my
land because you're

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:84%
giving me something
so incredible.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so I'm
getting a clue here.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So might we be looking at
the promise of salvation

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.304 align:middle line:90%
on some level?

00:31:34.304 --> 00:31:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: There you go.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
like for the reason

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that people bequeath
all of their goods

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.240 align:middle line:90%
to the church-- some.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.595 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:31:41.595 --> 00:31:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars were offering
something that the Catholic

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:90%
church wasn't.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were-- And
did it-- And if you

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.646 align:middle line:84%
look at the deeds in
Portugal-- and I've

00:31:48.646 --> 00:31:50.410 align:middle line:84%
read a lot of these
deeds of sale--

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
they would do it for
the good of their soul

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.866 align:middle line:84%
and for the-- to come
into the joys of paradise.

00:31:55.866 --> 00:31:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Now that suggests a
highly spiritual principle

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.690 align:middle line:90%
is at work here.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:01.480 align:middle line:90%
And it really was.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the Templars that were
tortured mentioned that, too.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.750 align:middle line:84%
They said that it
was a spiritual gift.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:90%
It was a spiritual treasure.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And this treasure allowed you
to have a mystical experience

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.100 align:middle line:84%
of God that opened up the
universe for what it is.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you connected
with that experience,

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.910 align:middle line:90%
you finally were liberated.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are all very
spiritual concepts here.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now,
this was happening

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.495 align:middle line:84%
during times that
were considered

00:32:24.495 --> 00:32:27.260 align:middle line:84%
the Dark Ages and
barbaric at large.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But again, this
was-- it sounds to me

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.686 align:middle line:84%
like they were
getting a large buy-in

00:32:32.686 --> 00:32:35.962 align:middle line:84%
by at least a certain segment
of the populations of Europe.

00:32:35.962 --> 00:32:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Totally.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:37.690 align:middle line:90%
They were loved for it.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Totally loved for it.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the properties
that they were being given

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
were-- they were rising
exponentially by the month.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.810 align:middle line:90%
It was ridiculous.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is the
beginning of where we begin

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.299 align:middle line:84%
looking at the accumulation
of the treasure--

00:32:50.299 --> 00:32:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of the
knight Templar.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll get into that
in a little bit later.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, there
were two parts.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that
segues quite nicely

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.280 align:middle line:84%
because there were two
parts to this treasure.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, one was to do with gold.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And yes, the Templars
did find a hoard

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:84%
of gold buried
under Templar Mound.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.700 align:middle line:84%
We know this because
the Copper scrolls that

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:84%
were found buried in this
cave in Qumran in 1947

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.970 align:middle line:84%
revealed that the Essenes had
buried their treasure ahead

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:17.790 align:middle line:84%
of the invading Roman
armies that we're

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:90%
taking over Jerusalem.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So they buried this
literal treasure.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And they told them
exactly where to go.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.020 align:middle line:90%
They gave exact specifications.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars
already knew where

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:30.100 align:middle line:90%
to dig under Templar Mound.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But there was another
unspecified treasure

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that was discussed in
the scrolls, as well,

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.926 align:middle line:84%
and it dealt with
specific spiritual values.

00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the behavior

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.370 align:middle line:84%
of the inner brotherhood
of the Templars,

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:42.950 align:middle line:84%
now the two come
together because when

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.000 align:middle line:84%
you look at how John the
Baptist was doing his practices,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.510 align:middle line:84%
when you look at how the
Essenes were doing there

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.970 align:middle line:84%
practices and the Mandaeans and
all of these spiritual groups

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.232 align:middle line:90%
around at the time.

00:33:53.232 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were doing
exactly the same thing.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:56.980 align:middle line:84%
They even wore the
same white habits,

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and had the ritual
cleansing every morning-

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.510 align:middle line:90%
the ritual of baptism.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So we can now begin to see
that the Templars stumbled

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.942 align:middle line:90%
upon this spiritual treasure.

00:34:05.942 --> 00:34:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And that treasure had to do
with this whole concept of what

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.850 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes and
even the Nazarenes

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
talked about as being
the rising of the dead.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:18.248 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Fascinating
subject because I thought

00:34:18.248 --> 00:34:20.164 align:middle line:84%
is this to do with the
resurrection of Christ,

00:34:20.164 --> 00:34:21.820 align:middle line:84%
the crucifixion,
and all this stuff

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.570 align:middle line:84%
because so many people have
pondered about the fact

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that, perhaps, it
was never meant

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:90%
to be a literal interpretation.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Gnostic
Gospels that were also

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.590 align:middle line:84%
uncovered in Qumran and
in Egypt clearly show

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:37.920 align:middle line:84%
that the church was very
specific about not allowing

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.050 align:middle line:84%
these gospels to be part
of the official canon.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the gospel of Phillip
specifically says, and I quote,

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:48.020 align:middle line:84%
"Anyone who believes in the
crucifixion as a real event

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.357 align:middle line:84%
is a fool because
these things weren't

00:34:50.357 --> 00:34:51.690 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be taken literally."

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:52.996 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or allegorical.

00:34:52.996 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're
all allegorical.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:55.036 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:55.036 --> 00:34:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the
rising the dead was

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.300 align:middle line:90%
to do with initiation ceremony.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.520 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes regarded
ordinary people--

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, anyone who
was in a human form

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:90%
was basically a vessel,

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:84%
a physical vessel made of
bone and physical matter

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:13.520 align:middle line:90%
where the soul was entrapped.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And the soul, basically, had
no connection to its source.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:84%
These people were
considered dead.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, the people who were allowed
inside their organization

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and who was deemed
to be worthy enough

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.670 align:middle line:84%
to receive the information
that was secret,

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.090 align:middle line:84%
they were taught over
a period of one year.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:90%
They were observed.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.530 align:middle line:84%
They were looked at and said,
well, these people-- maybe

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.210 align:middle line:90%
they've got it.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:84%
They can be trusted
with the information.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.893 align:middle line:84%
They're not going go out
and sell it to the Romans

00:35:35.893 --> 00:35:37.362 align:middle line:90%
or to anybody else.

00:35:37.362 --> 00:35:39.153 align:middle line:84%
Now we're bringing them
into the mysteries.

00:35:39.153 --> 00:35:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And over the course of
at least three years,

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.940 align:middle line:84%
they were indoctrinated
into the mysteries

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and the secrets
of the mysteries.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And their final
initiation ceremony,

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.120 align:middle line:84%
which was like a
graduation ceremony,

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.080 align:middle line:90%
was to have a ritual grave.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.370 align:middle line:84%
The initiate was taken into an
underground secret chamber, put

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
into a ritual grave
overnight, and in the morning,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the priests would
come out, lead the person out

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.310 align:middle line:84%
into the sunlight to be
greeted by the morning sun.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.902 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, that
person was considered to be--

00:36:07.902 --> 00:36:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reborn.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --risen from the dead.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Resurrected.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Resurrected.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the Essenes
would describe themselves

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:90%
as the followers of the way.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.640 align:middle line:84%
That phrase comes up
in 2000 BC in Egypt

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.120 align:middle line:84%
where the same
people were elected

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.470 align:middle line:84%
into the inner secrets
of the Egyptian pharaoh.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were risen
from a figurative grave,

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:84%
taken out first
thing in the morning,

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.900 align:middle line:84%
given the blessing of the Sun or
the Sirius, the star of wisdom,

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and they said the
initiate would cry out,

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.060 align:middle line:90%
"I have found the way."

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.600 align:middle line:84%
This is how we know that
the Templars were following

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.190 align:middle line:84%
this tradition because they
did exactly the same thing.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so I have
a little theory on this.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, good.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
theory and that

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.130 align:middle line:84%
is that, yes, the ways have
been obviously, mysteriously,

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:55.187 align:middle line:84%
and secretly preserved
throughout history.

00:36:55.187 --> 00:36:56.895 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
different suppositions

00:36:56.895 --> 00:37:00.300 align:middle line:84%
as to how that knowledge
was exactly preserved.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.780 align:middle line:90%
We do have fragments of it.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But also, I began wondering
about the notion of people

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.860 align:middle line:84%
who had been in these positions
of knowledge reincarnating

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.050 align:middle line:84%
back in within the
same traditions

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and bloodlines
throughout history

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and so then developing
or taking advantage

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.540 align:middle line:84%
of whatever name or guise
it was under at that time.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:24.270 align:middle line:10%
And so we might be also seeing
a very, very long lineage

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:26.520 align:middle line:10%
of the same souls
continuing to incarnate

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:10%
to preserve these
knowledges-- these practices

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.649 align:middle line:10%
and this knowledge, as well.

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:33.065 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: All things
being equal, I

00:37:33.065 --> 00:37:34.454 align:middle line:10%
would say that
was very feasible.

00:37:34.454 --> 00:37:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
now we're-- now,

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.078 align:middle line:84%
if you want to take it
forward, we'd even be going up

00:37:38.078 --> 00:37:39.560 align:middle line:90%
into the Masons.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.645 align:middle line:84%
Then we start looking at the
rituals that they go through.

00:37:42.645 --> 00:37:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Including their
third degree ritual,

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.512 align:middle line:84%
which is raising the candidate
from a figurative grave.

00:37:47.512 --> 00:37:49.428 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, that's
why I brought it up.

00:37:49.428 --> 00:37:51.625 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: His
blindfold is removed

00:37:51.625 --> 00:37:52.625 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly he can see.

00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:53.474 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:53.474 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well
there's a connection

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:59.150 align:middle line:84%
because the original Freemasons,
especially Scottish Rite

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Freemasonry and especially
the speculative branch

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.120 align:middle line:90%
was all to do the Templars.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And they do admit that
they are basically the--

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Extension, a modern
day version of the Templars.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.392 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, and
depending on who

00:38:11.392 --> 00:38:14.250 align:middle line:84%
was in power in the Vatican, the
Templars would get annihilated.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.980 align:middle line:84%
They survived in Scotland
and Portugal, ironically.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.094 align:middle line:90%
And then another pope comes in.

00:38:19.094 --> 00:38:20.260 align:middle line:90%
He's a bit more enlightened.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.490 align:middle line:90%
You get the Rosicrucians.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.057 align:middle line:84%
And then you get another
pope and they go underground.

00:38:24.057 --> 00:38:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the
Invisible College

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.057 align:middle line:90%
and then you get the Freemasons.

00:38:27.057 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing all
over and over again.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:29.515 align:middle line:90%
The same story.

00:38:29.515 --> 00:38:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you get
the same story also.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:90%
The same reflection of a split.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.842 align:middle line:84%
Corruption versus those
who are service oriented.

00:38:37.842 --> 00:38:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.966 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that really comes

00:38:39.966 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:84%
down to-- really
the individual soul

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and what their own
motive is because you

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.940 align:middle line:90%
can have that infiltrate.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I know as hard as they
tried to make sure

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.610 align:middle line:84%
that those who
came in were pure,

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:54.860 align:middle line:84%
there would still be those
who were not pure of heart.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, totally.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, humans
being what they are,

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.040 align:middle line:84%
you are subjected
to material forces.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.992 align:middle line:84%
And as science now
knows, it's all energy.

00:39:01.992 --> 00:39:03.200 align:middle line:90%
The whole universe is energy.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.920 align:middle line:90%
We're just energy.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:90%
And energy is neutral.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:84%
You can tell it what to
do and it'll say, OK.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a totally obedient
living organism.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.900 align:middle line:10%
And if we look at, for
example, the work that

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.830 align:middle line:10%
was done at Princeton where they
would take a group of people--

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.100 align:middle line:10%
normal people like
us-- into a laboratory.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.530 align:middle line:10%
And they asked these
people to focus

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:10%
on a computerized drumbeat.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And these 22 people would
focus on this computer.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Their singular focus
was with their intent

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to alter a drumbeat
on a computer.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't-- the chances,
of course, of that happening--

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.520 align:middle line:90%
zero.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, they succeeded.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the
power of intent,

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:90%
focused intent to alter matter.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very dangerous.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So intent
is what matters there.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Motive is something
else entirely.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.920 align:middle line:84%
That's more a matter of one's
own ethics and morality.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So here we have people who are
highly capable and skilled who

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.320 align:middle line:84%
are able to infiltrate
organizations or simply break

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.470 align:middle line:84%
off from an
organization and utilize

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.426 align:middle line:84%
those same powers but
in a destructive manner.

00:40:06.426 --> 00:40:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Wolves in sheep's
clothing, which

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:84%
still exists in every
movement to this day.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:10.645 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, totally.

00:40:10.645 --> 00:40:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are subjected
to all kinds of fears.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have pressure put
on- let's take a modern day

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.660 align:middle line:90%
example-- the Senate.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.520 align:middle line:84%
You have good people and
crazy people working there.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.410 align:middle line:90%
That's a common fact.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's easy to
demonize the whole thing.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, there
are good people.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, you can't
apply a brush to everybody.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.572 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's totally individual.

00:40:29.572 --> 00:40:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
people within Senate--

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.160 align:middle line:84%
some would argue a lot of them--
which are totally corruptible.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
special interests

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that infiltrate our political
organizations anywhere

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.690 align:middle line:84%
in the world will put this
energy in front of people.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:43.490 align:middle line:90%
And some will and some won't.

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:44.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it goes.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the lure of
it is not ascetic in nature.

00:40:47.295 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That's true.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.977 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not to go into
politics today, for example.

00:40:50.977 --> 00:40:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Or just
like into the church.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:52.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or into
the church, exactly.

00:40:52.895 --> 00:40:55.199 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Example, there are
people within the church

00:40:55.199 --> 00:40:56.490 align:middle line:90%
that if you go to sacred sites.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And most churches in
Europe, especially

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.700 align:middle line:84%
the Gothic cathedrals which
were put there by the Templars,

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:90%
ironically.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.600 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
do know what they're

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.210 align:middle line:84%
doing, in an esoteric and
early Christian manner that

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.400 align:middle line:84%
was actually consistent with the
teachings of John the Baptist,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.140 align:middle line:84%
which, incidentally, his
gospel was considered

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.580 align:middle line:84%
the treasure-- still is today--
by the Mandaeans in Iraq.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.071 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:41:19.071 --> 00:41:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
know-- have you read?

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Now first of all, I want to
say to anybody watching this

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.430 align:middle line:84%
that Freddie knows how to read
in-- you can read Portuguese

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of Latin
and a little bit of French.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So you were able to read the
original documents yourself.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It helps to scan
through a 600 page document

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.564 align:middle line:84%
and go, if this
means what it says,

00:41:38.564 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write this down,
go through Google Translate,

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.714 align:middle line:84%
and it gives you a rough idea
and you go, I get the point.

00:41:43.714 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I give it to
someone who really knows

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and you go, oh, it
really says that.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It really
does say that.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.975 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
John the Baptist.

00:41:48.975 --> 00:41:50.415 align:middle line:84%
Very few people
are aware of this.

00:41:50.415 --> 00:41:52.623 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: John the Baptist
is an incredible individual

00:41:52.623 --> 00:41:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and I had no idea and
I didn't appreciate him

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:90%
until I was doing this research.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.040 align:middle line:90%
This is a man who lived humbly.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.470 align:middle line:84%
He lived on a diet
of honey and locusts.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:06.460 align:middle line:84%
He lived in a little
cave at a place

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.710 align:middle line:84%
called the Location of the
Crossing, which is basically

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:13.522 align:middle line:84%
a town where Mary Magdalene,
ironically, also lived.

00:42:13.522 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The hills
outside of Jerusalem?

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.457 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Bethany,
and it's called

00:42:18.457 --> 00:42:19.540 align:middle line:90%
the Place of the Crossing.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.140 align:middle line:84%
It was a mound
just like they had

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.030 align:middle line:84%
in most of the places
around the world.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a sacred mound
where four rivers met.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
he did his work.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:30.275 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, he was basically
promulgating ancient traditions

00:42:30.275 --> 00:42:33.540 align:middle line:84%
of veneration of the natural
laws of spirit in the land.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can call him an
extension of the Green Man.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.900 align:middle line:84%
The man that's seen in
more churches than pictures

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.215 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus and Mary put together.

00:42:41.215 --> 00:42:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you see
in the Rosalyn Chapel.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.605 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:42:43.605 --> 00:42:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Green Man.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And John the Baptist,
basically, he

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:51.390 align:middle line:84%
was following in that bloodline
tradition of Egyptian-- sorry,

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.850 align:middle line:84%
of magician builder
priests who were also

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.590 align:middle line:84%
kings of the period who go
all the way back to Troy

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.980 align:middle line:84%
through King David
through Solomon who

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.090 align:middle line:84%
was said to be responsible
for the spiritual-- the higher

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.020 align:middle line:90%
spiritual morals of the land.

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them got it
right, as people do.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:84%
But John the Baptist certainly
was preaching that honesty,

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:16.400 align:middle line:84%
that back to basics of not
getting trapped into material

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.470 align:middle line:84%
forces of the world
but recognizing

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.360 align:middle line:84%
that you are a soul
trapped in a body

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and you come under the influence
of the vices of the world.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to
live a certain way

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:84%
where you don't fall
prey to those vices.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a very simple philosophy.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Basically, don't get caught up
in material wealth and material

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.773 align:middle line:84%
possessions because,
ultimately, they're not

00:43:35.773 --> 00:43:37.180 align:middle line:90%
going to do you much good.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.140 align:middle line:90%
He was a Buddhist, essentially.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So basically, he was
the priest messiah.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:47.090 align:middle line:84%
The power was held
within-- the holy bloodline

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.090 align:middle line:84%
was held by the
priestly messiah, not

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.570 align:middle line:90%
the kingly messiah.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.470 align:middle line:84%
But when he gets
beheaded, , unfortunately,

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:56.300 align:middle line:84%
this person called Jesus
who happens to be a member,

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.920 align:middle line:84%
not a leader, of the
Nazarenes, as they were called,

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:90%
who are also the Essenes.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And some books show that the two
names were often interchanged.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:90%
He was a member of that order.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And he suddenly,
he finds himself

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:09.740 align:middle line:84%
being not just a
kingly messiah, which

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.715 align:middle line:84%
is the vision of the
Merovingian bloodline

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that is shown to
the world, he now

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.750 align:middle line:84%
also has the dilemma of
saying, well, someone's

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.570 align:middle line:84%
got to take over
for this dead guy.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
Essenes are very--

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:84%
reading about their scrolls is
very interesting because they

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.690 align:middle line:84%
talked about Jesus
as being a person who

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:27.887 align:middle line:90%
usurped their secrets.

00:44:27.887 --> 00:44:29.095 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wait a minute.

00:44:29.095 --> 00:44:30.262 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make any sense.

00:44:30.262 --> 00:44:31.844 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'll
just say right here

00:44:31.844 --> 00:44:34.420 align:middle line:84%
for anyone that doesn't know
the British pronunciation of it,

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.419 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about Essenes
in American English.

00:44:36.419 --> 00:44:38.061 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

00:44:38.061 --> 00:44:40.919 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, which leads to
that wonderful about Yes song.

00:44:40.919 --> 00:44:41.835 align:middle line:90%
Essene no good people.

00:44:41.835 --> 00:44:42.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.478 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, go ahead.

00:44:43.478 --> 00:44:44.675 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes, exactly.

00:44:44.675 --> 00:44:48.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll never hear that
song the same way again.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:54.640 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes were very
much into righteousness.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Right action.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were
describing how they

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:84%
felt that Jesus
betrayed their doctrine.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And I could never
quite account for that

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.832 align:middle line:84%
because I thought, OK,
Jesus was a great person.

00:45:04.832 --> 00:45:08.190 align:middle line:84%
An avatar, a man no less,
not a god as the churches

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.155 align:middle line:90%
held him up to be.

00:45:09.155 --> 00:45:11.780 align:middle line:84%
But when they realized what the
Essenes were talking about they

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.550 align:middle line:84%
said, well, he was in such a
hurry to recruit people to get

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:17.590 align:middle line:84%
the Romans out of the land
and establish this new kingdom

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:20.270 align:middle line:84%
of God on the face of the
Earth-- this new Jerusalem--

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:22.930 align:middle line:84%
He was recruiting people
willy nilly without going

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:84%
through the usual
checks and balances

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.390 align:middle line:84%
that the Essenes
would-- the Essenes

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:31.360 align:middle line:84%
were so keen to preserve that
they said, this guy, basically,

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.310 align:middle line:90%
has betrayed our doctrine.

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The real person who
should be following

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.040 align:middle line:84%
in the footsteps
of John the Baptist

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.564 align:middle line:90%
is his brother, James the Just.

00:45:38.564 --> 00:45:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: James.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And in the coded
text that the Essenes left,

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.170 align:middle line:90%
he is described as the teacher.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, James
is killed, as well.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.544 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus inevitably
ends up with both roles.

00:45:51.544 --> 00:45:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the story
goes a little bit astray.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And then, of course, is usurped.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.870 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of a
literal crucifixion

00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.620 align:middle line:84%
is usurped by the
Catholic Church.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.507 align:middle line:84%
It could have so easily
been the other way.

00:46:01.507 --> 00:46:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:05.301 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we go back to the
ancient city of, you say,

00:46:05.301 --> 00:46:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Braga?

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.425 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Braga.

00:46:06.425 --> 00:46:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Braga and this story
of the first nations state.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, this is where it
gets very exciting because now

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:21.180 align:middle line:84%
we have a decided plan by the
members of the order of Sion,

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.230 align:middle line:84%
the Knights Templar,
and also the Cistercians

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.300 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to create this
new kingdom accountable only

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:27.800 align:middle line:90%
to God.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.740 align:middle line:90%
All of Europe is a mess.

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Where you going to go?

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:35.200 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go west because
the Portuguese have never

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.400 align:middle line:84%
really-- well, how do I
describe the Portuguese?

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.800 align:middle line:84%
They are a very unique nation
in that they refuse to govern

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and they will not rule anyone.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Even Julius Caesar had a problem
with the early Portuguese

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.230 align:middle line:84%
because they said these
people are totally autonomous.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:50.860 align:middle line:84%
They'll pay lip
service to authority,

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.330 align:middle line:84%
but they want to
live and let live.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How refreshing!

00:46:55.005 --> 00:46:56.005 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: How refreshing!

00:46:56.005 --> 00:46:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, self empowerment,
respect of others,

00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:59.490 align:middle line:90%
respect of self.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:00.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not difficult.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So the funny thing is, just when
the Templars do become official

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.960 align:middle line:84%
in 1118, Bernard of
Clairvaux himself sends

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.110 align:middle line:84%
a delegation of monks to
the county of Portucale

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to establish the first
Cistercian monastery.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the people who
was leading the group

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.080 align:middle line:84%
also turns out to be one of
the original Templar knights--

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.710 align:middle line:90%
brother Roland.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So now not only do we have
Templar knights in Portugal,

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.610 align:middle line:84%
we have Templar knights who
are also Cistercian monks.

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.900 align:middle line:84%
We also have another monk
who had already been there

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:34.820 align:middle line:84%
for seven years, a guy
called Brother Gondemare, who

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.480 align:middle line:84%
was very mysterious
and was always

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.230 align:middle line:84%
considered to be
Spanish, but it turns out

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.510 align:middle line:84%
he was born in a
town in Portugal.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.130 align:middle line:84%
He was also a Cistercian
monk and a member

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:45.240 align:middle line:84%
of the order of
Sion and recruited

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.760 align:middle line:84%
five years before the
Templars became official

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.590 align:middle line:84%
to buy land in
the city of Braga.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So by 1818 when the Templars
are being sanctified and said,

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.480 align:middle line:84%
here's a brand new
group of knights

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.921 align:middle line:84%
who are going to do these
incredible things in Temple

00:47:58.921 --> 00:47:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Mount.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.225 align:middle line:84%
Well, for seven
years, they've already

00:48:01.225 --> 00:48:03.130 align:middle line:90%
been buying land in Portucale.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.840 align:middle line:84%
They've been forging
diplomatic connections

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.300 align:middle line:84%
with the nobels, most of whom
were from Burgundy anyway.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're all basically
within the family.

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But the real linchpin of the
story is the fact that when

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.395 align:middle line:84%
Bernard of Clairvaux sends a
delegation to Portucale to form

00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:21.290 align:middle line:84%
his monastery, they basically
ask permission from the prince

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:24.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Portuguese who was a
nine-year-old boy by the name

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.610 align:middle line:84%
of Alfonso Henriques,
who turns out--

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:29.235 align:middle line:84%
and I let out that huge
expletive in the library

00:48:29.235 --> 00:48:34.490 align:middle line:84%
of Harvard when I read this-- on
page 500 of this enormous book

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:37.314 align:middle line:84%
written by monks and everybody
turned around because at that

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:38.105 align:middle line:90%
moment I realized--

00:48:38.105 --> 00:48:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You let
out an expletive.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --the penny
had just dropped.

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What?

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He was the nephew
of Bernard of Clairvaux.

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So we now have
family connections, as well.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:47.624 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we're
creating a new bloodline.

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:48.937 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's the same bloodline.

00:48:48.937 --> 00:48:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And if
Bernard of Clairveaut,

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and he was suspected
of being a Merovingian.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.558 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I should
point out at this point

00:48:54.558 --> 00:48:56.220 align:middle line:84%
that the Merovingians
use a talisman.

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.500 align:middle line:84%
It was the bee
and the honeycomb.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And Bernard of Clairvaux adopted
the same symbol, as well.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And of course, one of
the main temple places

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.797 align:middle line:84%
in Portugal to
this very day also

00:49:08.797 --> 00:49:10.380 align:middle line:84%
has that symbol
within its own chapel.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.512 align:middle line:84%
The only one of all the
Templar places in the world.

00:49:13.512 --> 00:49:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can you explain
what that symbol means?

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's
basically they used

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.700 align:middle line:90%
the symbol of the honeycomb.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to
Egyptian principles

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:26.800 align:middle line:84%
because back then this bloodline
extends from the Egyptians,

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.520 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.110 align:middle line:90%
They were called the bees.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:33.170 align:middle line:84%
These pharaohs who are very
highly spiritually trained

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and were right on the line,
they were called the bees.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And they adopted the
symbol of the honeycomb

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:42.300 align:middle line:84%
because it so epitomized
the order of the universe

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.926 align:middle line:90%
on the face of the Earth.

00:49:43.926 --> 00:49:45.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hexagonal, I
mean, even geometrically.

00:49:45.925 --> 00:49:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:48.470 align:middle line:90%
There's an order.

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:51.277 align:middle line:84%
The bee's almost like the sheep,
you can say, in Christianity.

00:49:51.277 --> 00:49:52.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a shepherd
at the center who's

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.770 align:middle line:84%
the queen bee ordering the other
bees to form this hive where

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:00.750 align:middle line:84%
everyone lives totally
codependent on each other

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to create this wonderful
system where everybody

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.311 align:middle line:90%
lives by the same rules.

00:50:04.311 --> 00:50:05.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful symbol.

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it totally
defines what they're about.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.476 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:08.476 --> 00:50:10.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, back to Portugal
now and this young man.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:14.690 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: This young man--
well, this young man,

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:17.320 align:middle line:10%
Alfonso Henriques,
the first-- who

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.660 align:middle line:10%
became the first
king of Portugal.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.000 align:middle line:10%
Interesting fellow.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.910 align:middle line:10%
Not many of the Portuguese
know about this,

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:25.600 align:middle line:10%
but when he was
actually doing all his,

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.130 align:middle line:10%
sort of, fighting to get the
Arabs out of his territory

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:31.540 align:middle line:10%
and also to claim the
land that was owed to him

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.340 align:middle line:10%
by his mother who was
a complete headcase.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was crazy.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.212 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the villain of your
book is really his mother.

00:50:38.212 --> 00:50:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Boy, she was a nut job.

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.893 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: She was totally insane.

00:50:40.893 --> 00:50:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
quite funny in a way.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Eventually he does succeed.

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:50.510 align:middle line:84%
He is given assistance
from the Templar knights

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.290 align:middle line:84%
who had pledged allegiance
even to his father who

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:55.270 align:middle line:90%
had died many years before.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:56.310 align:middle line:90%
And this is all written.

00:50:56.310 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in 1111, his own father
gave property to the Templars

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.300 align:middle line:90%
in the form of a castle.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, just before
he dies, gives them

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.730 align:middle line:84%
even more properties,
signs them over

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to an Archbishop of Braga who
turns out to have a second job.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.960 align:middle line:84%
He's also the grand master of
the Knights Hospitallers, who

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:18.910 align:middle line:84%
then becomes the mentor to
his son when the count dies.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So young Alfonso
has been groomed

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:25.180 align:middle line:84%
by the grand master of
the Knights Hospitaller.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, as legend
goes, he basically

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.330 align:middle line:84%
is crowned a knight on his 16th
birthday, which back then it

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.529 align:middle line:90%
was the coming of age.

00:51:31.529 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And many people have suspected
that the wording that he

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:37.660 align:middle line:84%
used highly suggests he may have
been indoctrinated as a Templar

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:38.770 align:middle line:90%
knight, as well.

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, when he finally gets
the independence of Portugal

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.030 align:middle line:84%
as a nation before it becomes
a nation state later on,

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:48.630 align:middle line:84%
first of all, he got
the independence going.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:49.960 align:middle line:90%
He writes a charter.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.066 align:middle line:84%
And on that charter,
unequivocally, he states--

00:51:53.066 --> 00:51:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and he's addressing
the Knights Templar

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:58.360 align:middle line:84%
on the charter-- "In all your
works and all your deeds,

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.824 align:middle line:84%
I do this because I
am also a brother."

00:52:01.824 --> 00:52:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
Templars address themselves

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.210 align:middle line:90%
to each other as brother.

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Even Hugues de Payens did that.

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And just to make sure that
the connection was not lost,

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:13.830 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge Templar logo also
on that symbol of independence.

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So he was a Templar
knight also all along.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So we can see quite clearly now
that the Templars, the order

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:21.994 align:middle line:84%
of Sion and the Cistercians
basically worked together

00:52:21.994 --> 00:52:23.160 align:middle line:90%
with all of these alliances.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With royalty.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they were the royalty

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, to create this
kingdom of heaven on Earth.

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
Portugal-- at what time

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.766 align:middle line:84%
did it finally gain its
nation state status?

00:52:32.766 --> 00:52:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It took some time.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.900 align:middle line:84%
From 1129 when it
gained its independence,

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:39.630 align:middle line:84%
finally they had to clear
out all the Arabs out

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:41.190 align:middle line:90%
of their territory.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.907 align:middle line:84%
And the nation state is defined
by a whole nation of people

00:52:44.907 --> 00:52:46.990 align:middle line:84%
who are defined by the
same characteristics, which

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:49.520 align:middle line:84%
meant clearing everybody
right down to Lisbon.

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.241 align:middle line:84%
And that finally
happened, of course,

00:52:52.241 --> 00:52:53.740 align:middle line:84%
on the feast day
of Mary Magdalene--

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:55.959 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --in 1139.

00:52:55.959 --> 00:52:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now this
is a part of history

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:01.120 align:middle line:84%
that's, really, you're helping
rewrite because this has not

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.890 align:middle line:84%
been understood up
until this time.

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's written in little
places in Cistercian manuals

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:09.395 align:middle line:84%
and books and big, big
books written in vellum.

00:53:09.395 --> 00:53:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But not in
the history books.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But not in
the history books

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:13.130 align:middle line:84%
because it's mostly
in Portuguese.

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:14.089 align:middle line:90%
No one's translated it.

00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.754 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:14.754 --> 00:53:16.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I would like to
jump forward a little bit.

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:18.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I think you've done a
beautiful job of laying out

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:22.880 align:middle line:90%
what was at the heart of it.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.657 align:middle line:84%
Again, you have to
read the book to be

00:53:25.657 --> 00:53:27.240 align:middle line:84%
able to put all these
pieces together.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, I think you've
told us a great deal about who

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.350 align:middle line:84%
they are, how they were
clouded with each other, what

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.940 align:middle line:84%
their doctrines were,
where they came from,

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.330 align:middle line:84%
how they intermarried,
and so forth.

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And now we've gotten
to the creation

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.180 align:middle line:90%
of the nation state of Portugal.

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to jump
way forward in history

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and how this was carried forward
into the Masonic times, as

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.070 align:middle line:84%
well, and then the
beginning of America.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ooh.

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only have
a couple minutes left.

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So the laying of the cornerstone
of the foundation of the White

00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:59.180 align:middle line:90%
House.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.795 align:middle line:84%
OK, please just tease
us a little bit.

00:54:01.795 --> 00:54:02.836 align:middle line:90%
People can read the book.

00:54:02.836 --> 00:54:05.326 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:54:05.326 --> 00:54:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If you look at the
main Templar places of-- well,

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.470 align:middle line:84%
the most important
locations for the Templar,

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:15.150 align:middle line:84%
especially after they were
dismissed as an order.

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I say dismissed
lightly because they

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.015 align:middle line:90%
survived in Scotland.

00:54:19.015 --> 00:54:21.265 align:middle line:84%
And the Portuguese held a
great affinity for the Scots

00:54:21.265 --> 00:54:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and quite rightly so because
the Templars basically

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.020 align:middle line:90%
moved to Portugal.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it was one
of history's greatest jokes

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:32.150 align:middle line:84%
when the King of Portugal
writes to the Vatican and says,

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.650 align:middle line:84%
under your orders
and instructions,

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:37.270 align:middle line:84%
we've made sure that the
Templars no longer exist.

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Well basically, he
sends the Templars down

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.550 align:middle line:84%
to the Algarve on
a six year hiatus.

00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:43.580 align:middle line:84%
When they come back,
he changes their name

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.337 align:middle line:84%
to the Order of
Christ, gives them back

00:54:45.337 --> 00:54:47.670 align:middle line:84%
their money and their land,
and they proceeded as usual.

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:48.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Massive
amounts of wealth.

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:48.968 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Huge.

00:54:48.968 --> 00:54:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That did not
disappear, by the way.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:52.084 align:middle line:90%
The never disappeared.

00:54:52.084 --> 00:54:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They get together
with the people who

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.300 align:middle line:84%
had been up in the preceptory
at Templin, Scotland right

00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.040 align:middle line:90%
beside Rosslyn Chapel.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.870 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
the point of origin

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.920 align:middle line:84%
of where this story starts
in Jerusalem and Mount Sion

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and you connect
those dots, there's

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.250 align:middle line:90%
a big triangle across Europe.

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:08.650 align:middle line:90%
A perfect triangle.

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:10.850 align:middle line:84%
You bisect that
triangle and you end

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.080 align:middle line:84%
in Saint Johns in
New Finland, which

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.090 align:middle line:90%
is named for John the Baptist.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.500 align:middle line:84%
You keep extending
that line, you

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.200 align:middle line:84%
end up in Delaware
Bay-- Chesapeake Bay.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you basically
draw a right angle

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and you end up in George
Washington's birthplace--

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:28.740 align:middle line:84%
exactly 122 miles
to Washington, DC,

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:32.890 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly 122 years away
from where the order ended.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:34.414 align:middle line:90%
Are these numbers by accident?

00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are and
not only that the date.

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:39.620 align:middle line:84%
The slaying of the most
prominent of the Templars.

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.442 align:middle line:84%
October 13, which is
still called Black Friday.

00:55:42.442 --> 00:55:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
was the day that they

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:47.730 align:middle line:90%
laid that cornerstone.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:48.987 align:middle line:90%
So it was chosen for a reason.

00:55:48.987 --> 00:55:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So this country was founded
upon those principles.

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:53.392 align:middle line:84%
Now I have one final
question to ask you.

00:55:53.392 --> 00:55:54.600 align:middle line:90%
This was all about the grail.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.260 align:middle line:90%
What is the grail?

00:55:56.260 --> 00:56:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The grail
is so many things.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:03.545 align:middle line:84%
It's been described as a
cup, a womb, a bloodline,

00:56:03.545 --> 00:56:06.587 align:middle line:90%
a gold object, and a salva.

00:56:06.587 --> 00:56:08.920 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the original
story written by Chretien de

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Troyes, he actually
describes a scene

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.430 align:middle line:84%
where the grail is
brought into the room--

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:18.420 align:middle line:84%
a gold object on a silver
platter called a salva.

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly enough, the
Templars' most famous monument

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:84%
in Tomar in Portugal
is called the Charola.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:29.520 align:middle line:84%
In Portuguese, that
literally means a salva,

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.172 align:middle line:84%
which would suggest to
me that the grail itself

00:56:32.172 --> 00:56:33.630 align:middle line:84%
is the building
and it was actually

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.660 align:middle line:84%
deposited in Portugal
which makes us then

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.640 align:middle line:84%
wonder why did they move
2,000 miles from Jerusalem

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.070 align:middle line:84%
to Portucale to
create a nation state?

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:42.826 align:middle line:90%
