>>ROBERT LEE CAMP: Every
ancient civilization,

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:84%
like the Chinese,
the Indians, they all

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.050 align:middle line:84%
claim to have
invented the cards.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said they
came from Atlantis.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.060 align:middle line:84%
These tell your lifetime
karma on the positive

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and the negative and what
you're likely to experience

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.450 align:middle line:90%
during your life.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.440 align:middle line:90%
It has four suits.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.493 align:middle line:90%
We have four seasons.

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:84%
We have red and black,
which is day and night.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But the most magical fact about
cards that most people don't

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:84%
know is you add up
the entire deck,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
it equals exactly the
number of days in the year.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I translated all these
spreads into linear spreads

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.392 align:middle line:84%
that were really easy to read
and wrote a book about it.

00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:84%
If you have a kid
who's a 10 of diamonds,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.083 align:middle line:84%
they'll either get it by being a
good kid or by being a bad kid.

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to
get your attention.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.516 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Who
among us doesn't enjoy

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:10%
a wonderful divination system?

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:10%
From astrology to numerology
to tarot, each of these systems

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:10%
has its value and
beauty in looking deeper

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:10%
into the hidden
influences in our lives.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps, my
very favorite of all

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
is the destiny cards, an ancient
system using a deck of cards.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I first discovered
the cards in the 1980s

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and picked it back up with
Robert Lee Camp's books

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.970 align:middle line:90%
in the early 2000s.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And we are very lucky to
have him here with us today.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Robert.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've got to tell you--

00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:90%
so I lived in Sedona.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Your books were pretty
much in every household.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
It was like the Gideon
Bible in Motel 6.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had the "Destiny"
or "Love Cards" or both.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:10%
And some became pretty
proficient at it.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that struck
me is how is it possible

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
they're that specific and
specifically accurate?

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.195 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, you're going to
help us understand all that.

00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:46.995 align:middle line:90%
So welcome.

00:01:46.995 --> 00:01:47.828 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: I'd love to.

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, first of all,
let's talk about the cards,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
where the system
came from initially,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.957 align:middle line:84%
because most of the people have
never heard of this system--

00:01:56.957 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah, well--

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.205 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --that's ancient.

00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMP: The first
book that was ever

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:10%
made public about this
was in 1894 by a man named

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:10%
Olney Richmond.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:10%
And before that, nobody
had ever heard anything.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:10%
And Olney Richmond said that
every ancient civilization,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:10%
like the Chinese,
the Indians, they all

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:10%
claim to have invented the
cards, which he said tells you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:10%
that it had to be
somebody much-- that was

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.100 align:middle line:10%
much earlier than all of them.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said they came
from Atlantis, which

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:90%
was like 20,000 years ago.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And passed
down through Egypt--

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:30.585 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: And passed down, yes.

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and then
on and went quiet.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:90%
It was really--

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.377 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's-- let me find out.

00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
This was part of underground,
almost priesthood kind

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge that was cloaked
and kept and used by only

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:90%
those with deep knowledge.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I have the
Olney Richmond book.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was like my eyes
are going every direction.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't figure that
out for the life of me.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: He was the World Checker
Champion three years in a row.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was?

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: And he
was an apothecary.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And back then, homeopathic
medicine was very common.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And to be an apothecary, you
had to be a mathematician

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
because they have to do
titrations of essences,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:90%
and it's like all this math.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what he did for a living.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.362 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well that book.

00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, and he--

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I remember he said it was
a very, very big deal when

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
he was told he was to release
this information because it had

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
not been released
to the public before

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:90%
in those thousands of years.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Yeah, he was given
the-- some books and information

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and told that he was going
to take this on and bring it

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.728 align:middle line:90%
to the attention of the world.

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this was
during the Civil War.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.895 align:middle line:84%
And he told the
guy, I'm not even

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:90%
going to live through this war.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And then later, he would share
stories of how bullets would

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:84%
just miss him-- like they'd go
through his hat or his legs--

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:84%
pant legs and just miss him and
how he came through the war.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.277 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:03:48.277 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was destined.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.401 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: And then he
established a temple in Chicago

00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.845 align:middle line:84%
and published a couple
of books out of that.

00:03:55.845 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
then that takes us

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
a little further along
Arne Lein, who-- that's

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.765 align:middle line:90%
the book I had in the '80s.

00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: "What's Your Card?"

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.807 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was one
book, "What's Your Card?"

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:90%
I remember it was gold.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us a little
bit about that distillation

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
before you then came
on to the scene.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.105 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Well, there
was a book before--

00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:84%
between Arne Lein's book
and "The Mystic Test Book."

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I don't
know about that one.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: And it's called "Sacred
Symbols of the Ancients"

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
by Florence Campbell
and Edith Randall.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:90%
So this book has been around.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:90%
It was published in the '40s.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.507 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't tell you anything
about the prediction aspect.

00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But it did tell you a lot
about each of the birth cards.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the book that
turned me on to the system.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:90%
A friend handed it to me.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:90%
And I read it.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was blown away by
how it described my life.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't flattering.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of--

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't have--
you have a hard card?

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And she let me know.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.665 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she's hard on some--

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:49.177 align:middle line:84%
they're hard on
some people's cards.

00:04:49.177 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:90%
And I threw it down.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
this is so negative.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And then two weeks
later, I was out

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:90%
finding one in the bookstore.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
this is so amazing.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.415 align:middle line:90%
I was already doing astrology.

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, how
could this possibly work?

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Because in astrology, you need
the time, the date, the place.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
In this, all you need is
the month and the day.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's eight birthdays
that had my same card.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
How was it possible
that it's accurate?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:90%
But it was.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like magic.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I really don't understand
how to this day.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm just constantly amazed.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why my friends and
I, when something's going on,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I tend to look at it
in hindsight because I

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:90%
don't want to get programmed.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Like this year is a
really difficult year.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to
have been looking.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.835 align:middle line:90%
I normally don't look.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
time, it actually helped.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yes, it's
going to be a tough year.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So pull on your big-girl under
breeches and deal with it.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Flow with it.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
So it can-- even if it's
hard stuff coming up,

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.385 align:middle line:90%
it can prepare you.

00:05:48.385 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Yeah, I mean, knowing
ahead of time that there's

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
a pothole on the road gives
you a chance to prepare for it,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
maybe change the
direction a little bit,

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:90%
change the attitude.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And looking
in hindsight, it's just

00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:90%
validating, like, oh, my god.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.948 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that year was
absolutely amazing.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything happened
for me that year.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.448 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: These kind of
years you're having, they

00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:13.780 align:middle line:84%
usually prelude a year
of a big new beginning.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Personally,
I feel that.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.415 align:middle line:84%
I feel so-- that huge doors
are going to be swinging open.

00:06:18.415 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: It's like
these things had

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to be cleared out to make
room for this new cycle that's

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So not to be afraid
when we look in the book and we

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:90%
see--

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.425 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Nines.

00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --nines.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
We see a whole bunch of
nines, which, in numerology,

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:84%
it's transformation or
death and transformation.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Just letting go.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.155 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Letting go.

00:06:37.155 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: --a nine can mean also--

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.810 align:middle line:84%
it can also mean fulfillment
in some situations

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.670 align:middle line:84%
because nines show
up when people

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:90%
get married who are single--

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.620 align:middle line:84%
nine of hearts-- because now
it's the end of being single.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.038 align:middle line:84%
Or you can-- if a nine
of diamonds comes along,

00:06:50.038 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:84%
you could actually achieve
something that you've wanted

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:90%
for years--

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:90%
for 20 or 30 years.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:90%
You finally achieve it.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And it brings happiness.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's still an ending.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It's an ending of that wanting
of this thing like that.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So what most people
don't realize

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:84%
about the common deck of cards
is how significant it is.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.675 align:middle line:84%
It's the only card
system, you might say,

00:07:10.675 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that perfectly matches the
cycles and the calendar

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:90%
of planet Earth.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lunar cycles.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: It has 13--

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:90%
it has four suits.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:90%
We have four seasons.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.930 align:middle line:90%
It's got 13 cards in each suit.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.530 align:middle line:84%
We have 13 full
moons every year.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:90%
There are seven days in a week.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And seven is the number
right in the center from ace

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:90%
to the king, from 1 to 13.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.140 align:middle line:90%
Seven sits right in the center.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the first of the
spiritual numbers.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:84%
We have red and black,
which is day and night.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
But the most magical fact
about cards that most people

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
don't know is if you take the
number value of every card

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:84%
in the deck-- we call it the
face value, an ace being a 1,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:90%
2, 3 up to--

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:90%
the Jacks are 11.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Queens are 12.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
You add up the entire deck,
it equals exactly the number

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:90%
of days in the year--

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.580 align:middle line:90%
365.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yes.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: And no other
card system does this.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And it shows you that it
was made for planet Earth.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:84%
It was made to be a
symbolic representation

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:90%
of the cycles of the Earth.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, I mean,
in my system of belief,

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I would just-- if
I were just going

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
to be kind of a pop
analyst on this,

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I would think you were one of
the masters in the Atlantean

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's time to reintroduce it.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:84%
You've come in
these times to help

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
people have this
kind of system to be

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
able to make sense
of their lives

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
more easily because
you've made it easy.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah, I saw it.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, everybody
should be able to use this.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.345 align:middle line:84%
It was complicated
when I learned it.

00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
You had to learn how to
read these Grand Solar

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Spreads that go on.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And even I made mistakes
in calculating the cards

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
for each year and
each planetary period.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:90%
So I was already a programmer.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.610 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.027 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
life's been devoted

00:08:51.027 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:84%
to making this simple,
accessible to everyone.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: So I translated
all these spreads

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:84%
into linear spreads that
were really easy to read

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and wrote a book about it
and made it easy to use.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- been
my purpose ever--

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:90%
all along.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here,
we have-- we're

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:90%
going to look at a couple.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
We'll look at the
spiritual spread

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:84%
first and the top cards
in the spiritual spread.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.093 align:middle line:84%
So just tell us what
that means, what's--

00:09:14.093 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
whatever at the
top of that means.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: So these two spreads are
the heart of the entire system.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.905 align:middle line:10%
And if you understood it
completely, you would--

00:09:21.905 --> 00:09:24.995 align:middle line:10%
everything you need
is found in these two,

00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:10%
even though there's
actually 90 of these total.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.900 align:middle line:10%
Because these are-- if
you look at the difference

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:10%
between a spiritual
and a life spread,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.700 align:middle line:10%
you see that the cards have
moved to different locations.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:10%
And it's done by a very specific
process called quadration.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:90%
And I could display that.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.885 align:middle line:90%
But it would take too long.

00:09:41.885 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and a lot
of people don't like math

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.385 align:middle line:84%
and all that, so
let's not do it.

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:48.378 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: So there's-- you
end up quadrating this one.

00:09:48.378 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes the life spread.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And you quadrate that.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes the next.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And each of these also
represents a year of life.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
You find your card
here in this spread.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a specific
method for counting.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
So the life spread is like our
lifetime karma, you might say.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
your natal chart.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Where you are in this
life spread, your position

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.470 align:middle line:84%
in this life spread,
it tells most

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:84%
of the karma you're going to
experience in this lifetime.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I'm looking
at this in front of me.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And here, we see--
across the bottom,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:84%
we see astrological signs
and also down this side.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.665 align:middle line:90%
So now, how does that factor in?

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: So people that know
astrology, this system comes

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
very quickly to
them because there

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
is an astrological
element to this system.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Each of these lines and columns
are governed by a planet.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you find your card,
like you are a six of clubs,

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.527 align:middle line:84%
it's the Saturn column
and the Neptune line.

00:10:41.527 --> 00:10:43.235 align:middle line:10%
And that tells a lot
about your lifetime.

00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, for
example, what would that

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:10%
tell about a six of clubs?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMP: Well, if you
notice, both cards--

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:10%
both sides, six of clubs is in--
in one, it's in a Saturn line.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:10%
In the other, it's
in a Saturn column.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.145 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a strong
affiliation with Saturn--

00:10:58.145 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: So there's Saturn.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which,
if we knew, we'd

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.625 align:middle line:84%
be terrified-- if we
knew that at birth.

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:02.425 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Well, what it means
is that most six of clubs

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:90%
are very hard on themselves.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:90%
They're very Saturn to themself.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
They actually have the
most blessed life spread

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%
of every card.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They have the best
card in Venus for love.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
They have the best card
in Mars and Jupiter

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:90%
for money and success.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they are
hard on themself.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:84%
They demand so much of
themself, you understand?

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To drive to be--
to do the best you can?

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Exactly.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:90%
And they need to be honest.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And they insist on that.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: King Charles
has the six of clubs.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.762 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Oh, there are so many
the famous six-of-clubs people.

00:11:39.762 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:10%
Because six of clubs,
your life spread

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.108 align:middle line:10%
goes from the six of clubs
to the six of spades,

00:11:44.108 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:10%
the queen of hearts,
and up to the 10

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:10%
of clubs to the crown line.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:90%
So all six of clubs think big.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:90%
They're always looking ahead.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:90%
My brother's the six of clubs.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.635 align:middle line:84%
And he goes to me, Robert,
why aren't you famous yet?

00:11:57.635 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You should be.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're becoming famous.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: But he's always
thinking that way.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of six of clubs,
that's how they think.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
a larger vision.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a missionary card.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's about taking
and helping transform.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Well, its
highest role is

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to be a vessel for knowledge
to-- that helps mankind,

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's the John
the Baptist card who

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:90%
brought the knowledge of Jesus.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's the allegory.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that's your
brother and Prince Charles

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and even me and many others.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.755 align:middle line:90%
Now, your card.

00:12:27.755 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMP: Queen of diamonds,
one of the two hardest

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.598 align:middle line:10%
cards in the deck.

00:12:31.598 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Did you
resent your brother

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:10%
for having such an easy life?

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMP: Well, he
was always smiling.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:10%
My brother is always smiling.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:90%
He had a good last lifetime.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:84%
He's another piece
of work, my brother.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't resent him for
it because I was the oldest.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.803 align:middle line:84%
So I got to kick his
butt when I was young.

00:12:53.803 --> 00:12:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you got--
you trumped him that way?

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about your queen of diamonds.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Well, the
queen of diamonds,

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
we get tested on every
single area of life-- money,

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:10.385 align:middle line:84%
relationships,
attitude, uncertainty.

00:13:10.385 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of queen of diamonds
have multiple marriages.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.775 align:middle line:84%
I'm in my fifth
and last marriage.

00:13:14.775 --> 00:13:16.692 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have
a beautiful little son.

00:13:16.692 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And you're happy.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.773 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: I'm the same
birthday as Tom Cruise.

00:13:18.773 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:90%
He's had three.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:84%
He'll probably have four
or five before he's done.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And it takes a long time.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of karma.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of cards that
have a lot of tremendous karma

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:90%
from past lives.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And queen of diamonds
is one of those cards.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:90%
It has a lot of karma.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.415 align:middle line:84%
So we have to get straightened
out about a lot of stuff.

00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't it
interesting, though?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:90%
You saw this card at first.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And this woman was
quite harsh with--

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:90%
about the reality of this card.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking, get
that thing away from me.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you end up embracing
this as your life's work,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.965 align:middle line:84%
even though you feel you didn't
have the greatest advantages

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:90%
through the cards yourself.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Yeah, I recognized
the truth of it.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
That was probably
my only saving grace

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:84%
is I realized, yeah,
it's hard to hear this.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:90%
But this is all absolutely true.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can't deny it.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
That's how my life--
and I was young then.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.405 align:middle line:84%
So I hadn't even seen
the bulk of it yet.

00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:13.195 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so there you go.

00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example of a
couple of different cards

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:90%
and how they show.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So back to looking
at the spread.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So we see the astrological
part, which we talked about.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.057 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
across here these--

00:14:24.057 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:90%
the top cards there.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: There are some
significant positions,

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.883 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Jupiter
is the best planet.

00:14:30.883 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the Jupiter
line or the Jupiter column,

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:84%
you have a lot of
blessings in your life.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:10%
The 10 of diamonds,
being the double Jupiter

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:10%
card, which is always protected,
bad things do happen to them.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.708 align:middle line:84%
But nothing ever
really gets them.

00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And we're talking about--

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like
the lightning will

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:90%
strike the person next to you?

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: That's right.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.198 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about Tom
Brady and RF Kennedy Jr.

00:14:55.198 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, we're going to
get back to him in a bit too.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: So here's
this 10 of diamonds.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
most blessed card.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
interesting because they

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.088 align:middle line:90%
have two outstanding things.

00:15:07.088 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
They have a five of
hearts in Saturn,

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:84%
which means they all will
go through a tremendously

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.073 align:middle line:84%
difficult divorce, if not,
two in their lifetime.

00:15:14.073 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a divorce card.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or even loss of a
spouse or some kind of loss?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: That could happen
that way too, sure.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is that
even though they're blessed,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
they have a hard time
receiving money and prosperity

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:90%
from the universe.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they have
to give to everybody

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and won't let
people give to them.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So Tom Brady was the best
quarterback that ever lived

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and the lowest-paid
quarterback that ever lived.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I didn't
know that because I don't

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:90%
read the sports pages anymore.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:90%
But seriously?

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:90%
He--

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet he's still
in the news every day.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what he
does, wives, girlfriends.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: It also is the
center of the whole deck.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.555 align:middle line:84%
So it wants to be the
center of attention,

00:15:48.555 --> 00:15:49.430 align:middle line:90%
one way or the other.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: I mean, though, if
you have a kid who's a 10

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:84%
of diamonds, they'll either
get it by being a good kid

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.528 align:middle line:84%
or by being a bad
kid, but they're

00:15:56.528 --> 00:15:57.695 align:middle line:90%
going to get your attention.

00:15:57.695 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Tom Brady does get
our attention, no matter what

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:90%
was going on in his life.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: And he's a Leo too.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, Leo is already--

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.708 align:middle line:84%
he's like the quintessential
10 of diamonds of all time.

00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to talk about Robert F.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy a little bit later--

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Sure.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in that.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Sure.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so across
the top, then, these-- you

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:90%
call these the crown cards?

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.273 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: This is
called the crown line.

00:16:16.273 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:10%
So people that live up
there or whose cards

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.275 align:middle line:10%
are up there, these people think
they're better than everybody

00:16:22.275 --> 00:16:23.075 align:middle line:10%
else.

00:16:23.075 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They've
got an attitude.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMP: Well, it's like
all you guys down here,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:10%
all you 49 cards down here,
you're the common folk.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:90%
All the rules that apply to you.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:90%
They don't really apply to us.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.520 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about Johnny Depp.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he's
destined to be--

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:90%
have a very pronounced life?

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah, but I had a--

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I have a best friend
who's that birthday.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And he's-- he was
running for mayor--

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.105 align:middle line:84%
for sheriff, I'm sorry, in
our county, where I live.

00:16:51.105 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But then he passed away
all of a sudden at age 55.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:90%
He just passed.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He didn't meet that--

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: He had a
heart condition.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --potential
for that destiny.

00:16:57.875 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But the potential
is always there.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And that king of
spades is so strong.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:84%
That's the strongest
card in the whole deck.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's completely fixed,
like, their will is--

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be their
way or the highway.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good
or a bad thing,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:90%
depending on how you look at it.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.454 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
doesn't lend to diplomacy?

00:17:16.454 --> 00:17:18.516 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: No, but it
does lend to power.

00:17:18.516 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it does-- yeah,
absolutely lends to power.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: It lends to taking
responsibility for stuff

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and not blaming anybody else
for how things are going.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people are--

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%
as we discovered, three
people on your staff

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.190 align:middle line:84%
have-- here have 10 of
clubs as one of their cards.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're all
about broadcasting,

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.082 align:middle line:84%
getting the word
out about something.

00:17:39.082 --> 00:17:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could it
be more perfect?

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: I mean, so many
10 of clubs are famous.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:84%
It's mind-blowing how many 10
of clubs end up being famous.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:90%
It's so common.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.243 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of them have
these other cards with them.

00:17:51.243 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's a double whammy.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
how that goes.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And at the center is the 10 of
diamonds we just talked about.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And then what about the
cards that are down?

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:10%
Does it matter what's
toward the top or bottom,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:10%
or is it all about this
alignment between these two

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:10%
columns?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.715 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Well, the
direction of these cards,

00:18:08.715 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle line:84%
when you look at it, is
they go from the right side

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:90%
to the left side.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.900 align:middle line:84%
If you notice over here, the
ace of hearts on the spiritual

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:90%
spread.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And it goes that way
instead of the way we read,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:90%
which is from left to right.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So when your-- and
your life spread

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.478 align:middle line:90%
proceeds in front of you.

00:18:21.478 --> 00:18:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So the first card
in your life spread

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
represents the first
13 years of your life.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So in your case, it
was the six of spades

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and then a queen of
hearts the next 13 years.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.842 align:middle line:84%
And then you go up
here for 13, 13, 13.

00:18:32.842 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So you've got-- so
the six of clubs

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:90%
has 39 years in the crown line.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's a long time.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: So because
of that, cards

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
down here-- a lot
of cards down here

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:84%
have the potential to achieve
a lot of notoriety and fame

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:84%
because this is the place of
fame and recognition, up here.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like the 10th
house in astrology.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:90%
It's very similar.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.263 align:middle line:84%
People that have
10th house planets

00:18:53.263 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
always feel like they're
going to be something

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.285 align:middle line:90%
special in their lifetime.

00:18:56.285 --> 00:18:57.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:57.085 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what about that when
you go into the destiny cards,

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:84%
you'll look up your year,
which is the age you are.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
seeing these influences

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
that have an astrological
influence during--

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.900 align:middle line:84%
like a couple of month
breakdowns or so.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.780 align:middle line:90%
How does that go?

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:90%
And what is that showing us?

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.477 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMP: So in the
book, there will

00:19:14.477 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:10%
be two pages in the "Cards
of Your Destiny" book

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:10%
that has your whole life in
little, tiny lines of cards

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:10%
called spreads.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:84%
There's like 17
cards in each spread.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And these cards are divided
up in different ways.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
There are seven periods of
the year, which is another--

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:84%
here's another really amazing
thing about the cards.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.135 align:middle line:84%
There are seven
periods of the year.

00:19:34.135 --> 00:19:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Each one is 52 days long.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:90%
There you have that 52.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And five and two
together is a seven.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's just-- seven is
everywhere in the cards.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.317 align:middle line:84%
So at-- on your birthday,
it begins the new year.

00:19:46.317 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:90%
And you'll have these two cards.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.312 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be in
the Mercury period,

00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:90%
the first period of the year.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.895 align:middle line:84%
And these two
cards will tell you

00:19:52.895 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
what's happening, who
it's happening with,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:84%
what the nature of it
is going to be for you.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
it's showing the card.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So that might be a card of
a key person in your life.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: It could be
somebody in your life.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be an event.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be both
at the same time.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:05.785 align:middle line:90%
So you can--

00:20:05.785 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you'll
see if it's under Saturn

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:90%
or Mercury or Jupiter?

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.265 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: You have a Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,

00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Uranus, and Neptune period.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And each has a distinct
quality, Saturn

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
being the most difficult,
Jupiter and Venus

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:90%
being the most fun, usually.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't plan a trip
during a Saturn period.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a Saturn period.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unless
it's a trip to Earth,

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.603 align:middle line:90%
mine are all Saturn, apparently.

00:20:26.603 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Well, sometimes
you can't avoid it.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But in general,
you would want to--

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:90%
it's good for doctor visits.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It's good for
teaching, for being--

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:90%
and getting taught by somebody.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.849 align:middle line:90%
But it's not good for fun stuff.

00:20:38.849 --> 00:20:39.891 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cabo San Lucas.

00:20:39.891 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, got you.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: But then
you have five cards

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:90%
that influence the entire year.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
most important.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
They're the headliners
of the year,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.730 align:middle line:84%
like the long-range card,
the environment displacement

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:90%
and Pluto and result cards.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And these tell you a general
theme for the whole year,

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:84%
which, in retrospect,
you'll look and see

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:90%
that it's been accurate.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:84%
You won't really get
the message until you

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
get into the year, maybe three
periods, because it's so new,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:90%
the year.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's really cool how
every year on your birthday

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
you have completely
new influences.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And you can see them coming.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to
make a lot of money

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.243 align:middle line:84%
and you saw that you
had a really good money

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
card coming up in a period,
you could plan for that

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.875 align:middle line:84%
and make-- take some
action that would allow

00:21:23.875 --> 00:21:25.125 align:middle line:90%
people to give you more money.

00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe someone comes
along with a suggestion

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:90%
you might otherwise ignore.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.008 align:middle line:90%
And you think, wait a minute.

00:21:30.008 --> 00:21:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Or let's say your
health is a little iffy.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And you see you have a difficult
health card coming in Saturn.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can take
action now to improve

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:84%
your lifestyle and
your health situation

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.892 align:middle line:84%
so that this one will be
minimized ahead of time.

00:21:42.892 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
mean, that's kind

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:90%
of how I interacted with it.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd never before
looked up a year in advance.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I usually look in hindsight.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.367 align:middle line:90%
I want to find my own way.

00:21:52.367 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
But I just happened
to and saw that it

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
was going to be very
difficult. And actually, it's

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:90%
been helpful.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.177 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, let go.

00:21:58.177 --> 00:21:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Just let it flow over you.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.927 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: I did a show
with Marilu Henner.

00:22:00.927 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:90%
And she was a real skeptic.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:90%
She's a two of spades.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:90%
So she's very logical.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.510 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, these cards.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:90%
These cards.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:90%
What is this all about?

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.385 align:middle line:84%
This is before
we're on the show.

00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- well, she
said, well, I looked.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And I had a son last year.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:90%
And I don't see his--

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't see a birth--

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.157 align:middle line:90%
having a child card anywhere.

00:22:22.157 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I go, what's his birthday?

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And she told me.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was her long-range
card for the year.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And she resulted.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: She still did
not want to admit that it

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.340 align:middle line:90%
had made any sense to her.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it does, I do say.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's evident.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.697 align:middle line:84%
You can see that from
the birth of your child.

00:22:36.697 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Look at their card.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.110 align:middle line:84%
You kind of get a
feeling for what

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.108 align:middle line:90%
their soul has come in to do.

00:22:41.108 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Yeah, their challenges,
as well as their gifts.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: I'm thinking of
writing a book about parents

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and children and the cards
because it would really

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:84%
help a lot of parents give their
children a better start in life

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
by understanding their nature
and not fighting with it,

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.950 align:middle line:84%
trying to make
them into something

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.210 align:middle line:90%
that they want them to be.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:00.893 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
would be so useful.

00:23:00.893 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: That's the only
book I have in my mind

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:03.935 align:middle line:90%
that I might write, for me.

00:23:03.935 --> 00:23:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like how--

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:84%
essentially, how
do you engage with

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:90%
and raise a king of spades?

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Or how do you
raise a five of clubs,

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:18.480 align:middle line:84%
which will go against all
norms and not follow the advice

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.152 align:middle line:90%
of their father or anybody--

00:23:20.152 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was my sister.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.325 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: --and resist
authority figures

00:23:23.325 --> 00:23:25.677 align:middle line:84%
and be-- do the craziest
things that anybody else ever--

00:23:25.677 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:90%
would never even think of.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They take chances.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: They do.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:84%
They want to
experience everything.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk about
that for a moment-- resonance

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:84%
In my family, for example,
my parents are deceased now.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
My mother was the
seven of spades--

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean of clubs.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm the six.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.217 align:middle line:90%
My sister is the five.

00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:47.190 align:middle line:90%
My dad's the four.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.165 align:middle line:90%
My son's the two.

00:23:49.165 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:90%
His father's the two.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: You're a triple club.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I'm a triple club.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: All three
of your clubs--

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:90%
your cards are clubs.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.393 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I'm a triple club.

00:23:55.393 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so everyone in
our family are clubs.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And we also got--
we got on well.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.500 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMP: Yeah, but, well,
depending on your karma,

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:10%
you'll either be in a
family where there's harmony

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:10%
or there can be disharmony.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
There can be-- there's all sorts
of karma that gets interwoven

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.150 align:middle line:90%
into families.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many
siblings did you have?

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: One.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have six.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's a lot
of potential for disharmony.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Yeah, two of my siblings
are six of clubs, by the way.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Two of them?

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: I have a sister and a
brother who are six of clubs.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I'm wondering.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.613 align:middle line:84%
There are these resonances
that we draw to us.

00:24:31.613 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: I seem to have some
karma with six of clubs.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just have had a
lot of different connections

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:90%
with six-of-clubs people.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:90%
And I can see it in the cards.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.733 align:middle line:90%
I can see it show up there.

00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But you'll have
that in your life.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:84%
You'll have certain people
that you run into a lot of.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, you had
a lot of 10 of diamonds?

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I have a
ton of four of diamonds.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Four of diamonds.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love them.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:52.605 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah, well--

00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Easy relationship.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:90%
I love four of diamonds.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.755 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Well, depending
on their birthday,

00:24:56.755 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
you got a lot of
connections with them.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.850 align:middle line:84%
You're in the same
row down here.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:90%
You're in the bottom row.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but what
about this notion of families?

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Is it unusual for families
to come in in a similar suit

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:90%
or the preponderance of them?

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: It's a
little bit unusual

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.920 align:middle line:90%
if they're all the same suit.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it is.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.117 align:middle line:90%
That's unique.

00:25:15.117 --> 00:25:17.325 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen families that
all have the same number.

00:25:17.325 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK,
let's talk about that.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about that family
and what the number was.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: I had a family that
all-- they were all nines.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:23.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:25:23.595 --> 00:25:25.065 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Yeah, they
were all nines.

00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, I can't
fathom how that would flow.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Well, being a
nine is considered--

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.622 align:middle line:84%
it's a tough life
unless you're spiritual.

00:25:33.622 --> 00:25:34.830 align:middle line:90%
A lot of spiritual teachers--

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are nine.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: --are nines.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Eckhart Tolle's a
nine of diamonds.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Einstein was a nine of diamonds.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And so there is--

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
in the life of a nine,
you have to let go.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So it can either be a life of
complaining about how much you

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:90%
lose all the time.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be a lifetime of
merging with the infinite

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.475 align:middle line:90%
and becoming awake.

00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did that family
contend with the nines?

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.189 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Well, they were--

00:26:03.189 --> 00:26:05.064 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Somewhere
between awake and asleep?

00:26:05.064 --> 00:26:06.397 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: They were kind of weird.

00:26:06.397 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
They were kind of weird.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:90%
I remember they had this baby.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't-- they
covered all the furniture

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:84%
in their house with plastic
so that he couldn't get

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:90%
the furniture dirty.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:90%
And I can't conceive of that.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, my
mother did that.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:84%
We had our little
thighs sticking

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to that nasty clear
plastic growing up.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.010 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Well, it
becomes an obsession.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.555 align:middle line:84%
Nines can be
obsessive about stuff

00:26:32.555 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:90%
because it's a high number.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:90%
There's only the 10 above the 9.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.795 align:middle line:84%
All the higher numbers can be
a little obsessive at times.

00:26:39.795 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so
that would be crazy.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about another
kind of reflection, which

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.650 align:middle line:84%
is if you have a
family or a group

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:90%
with a preponderance of fives.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: I'd like to see that.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: I mean, fives are
always breaking tradition.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they mean they
want change, change, change.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: And the very
essence of a five

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:84%
is dissatisfaction,
like, I'm not

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:84%
happy with where I'm
at, what's going on.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So that leads to adventures,
to travel, to non-commitment

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:90%
in relationships and jobs.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Freedom is sacred to fives.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So I can't even imagine
a family of fives.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.140 align:middle line:90%
What would that be like?

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What that'd be like--

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.552 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Most five people have
a lot of issues with their dads

00:27:27.552 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:84%
because the dad is the
essential authority figure.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're totally
against authority.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So they usually have
an abusive relationship

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
with their fathers in some form,
either verbally or physically.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or even perceived.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.385 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: So it's interesting.

00:27:44.385 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But then you have the five of
clubs, which, a lot of them

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:84%
become really rich because
they have the millionaire's

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:90%
card in their life spread.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:84%
They have the seven of
diamonds and Jupiter,

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:90%
which is the millionaire's card.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.448 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wow, yes.

00:27:54.448 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: So they come into money
very quickly in their life.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're
social outcasts or just

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:05.760 align:middle line:84%
on the fringes of society in
some other form, they're happy.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.622 align:middle line:90%
They have weird relationships.

00:28:07.622 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:90%
They don't get married.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But they have partners that
they're with for 30 years

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:84%
but off and on and no rules
and openness and things

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.382 align:middle line:84%
that traditional people
would just say, oh,

00:28:19.382 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:90%
that's horrible, right?

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:90%
But that's them.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:90%
They're fives.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.610 align:middle line:84%
We have five fingers
on each hand.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.980 align:middle line:90%
We have five holes in our face.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:90%
We're five raced.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:90%
We're a five race of people.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.263 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, the fifth race.

00:28:30.263 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: "Star Trek" is
like-- all the other cultures

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.640 align:middle line:84%
in "Star Trek" go, what's
with you humans exploring

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.050 align:middle line:90%
all the time?

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.714 align:middle line:90%
What's with this?

00:28:39.714 --> 00:28:40.543 align:middle line:90%
It's really true.

00:28:40.543 --> 00:28:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because a
lot of other species

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.980 align:middle line:84%
don't understand this
climbing the hill just

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:90%
to see what's on the other side.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Exactly.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:90%
That's a five thing.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're five--
we're a five raced--

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that's why the cards would
never work on any other planet

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:90%
than the Earth.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:90%
They're made for planet Earth.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And so here, we've
talked a little bit

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.208 align:middle line:84%
about the seven, a little
bit about the five.

00:29:00.208 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little bit
about the 10 specifically.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: The nines.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the nines.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So people need to
just get the books

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:84%
because we're only-- we only
have so much time today.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to get into
some of the other fun stuff.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Someone gave me a playing deck
with teensy little playing

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:90%
cards, little tiny ones.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.060 align:middle line:90%
They're like an inch.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I put them in
a cute, little bowl.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.262 align:middle line:84%
And then every
now and then, I'll

00:29:19.262 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
stir them around with my finger
and feel around under there

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:90%
and just pull a card, right?

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that a way we
can also use these cards--

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Yeah.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --besides
drilling down into ourselves

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:90%
and our loved ones?

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: And if you
happen to just find

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.788 align:middle line:84%
a card on the ground somewhere,
like you're walking around,

00:29:33.788 --> 00:29:35.580 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you find them
just laying around,

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.780 align:middle line:90%
there's a message there.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:84%
That's a way a message
can be given to us.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
important to know

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that the book has your whole
life laid out for you every 52

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:90%
days of your life.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's upsetting
to people because it's

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:90%
like, hey, wait a minute.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Where's my free will?

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Well, good.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Let them think about that,
because go back in your past

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:90%
and test it.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I moved this year.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Let me see if
that's in the book.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
where you have

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
to get to understanding free
will on a different level.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:84%
The soul is the one with
the greatest free will.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
The mind that we live
in, this little mind,

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
is the most highly conditioned
and programmable and so forth.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: We have a spiritual
teacher in Nashville.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:90%
She's awake.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.560 align:middle line:90%
She's 50 years old.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.720 align:middle line:84%
She's a beautiful
woman with a family.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's a five of diamonds,
which you would never

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.000 align:middle line:90%
think would get married.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.420 align:middle line:90%
And she-- her spirituality is--

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:84%
the way she teaches is like a
five of diamonds would teach.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But she has none of the
negative qualities of her cards

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:41.310 align:middle line:84%
because there's no ego there
that's resisting anything.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible to
transcend all this stuff.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But you may still
act like your card.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.680 align:middle line:84%
But you won't be playing out
the negatives of that card.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
again, this is--

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:84%
we choose to be born
in a certain place

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:90%
at a certain time.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're-- our soul is already
stamping onto our lives these

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:90%
esoteric influences.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.703 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: And we're bringing
with us this past life karma,

00:31:01.703 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:84%
which the cards reveal, like
your card, your birthday,

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:84%
your planetary ruling
card, your other--

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:90%
and your life spread cards.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.800 align:middle line:84%
These tell your lifetime
karma on the positive

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and the negative and what
you're likely to experience

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.100 align:middle line:90%
during your life.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.825 align:middle line:84%
And the fun thing about
the book, the "Love Cards,"

00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:90%
you can-- you look up your card.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And then next to
it is the table.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And you look up
the person's card

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.480 align:middle line:84%
that you have some kind
of relationship with.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.997 align:middle line:84%
And it will tell
you this numeric--

00:31:25.997 --> 00:31:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: What your connections
are with each other.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It'll tell you how
intense the connection is,

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.290 align:middle line:84%
how much attraction there is,
and how much compatibility

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:90%
there is.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.430 align:middle line:90%
And you see these numbers.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.500 align:middle line:90%
And, man, they're right on.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.820 align:middle line:90%
They're right on.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a quick look
into whether or not

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.445 align:middle line:84%
you want to run for the hills
or whether you want to transform

00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:90%
yourself through challenge.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: It's such an
amazing accurate system

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:90%
with relationships.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all of it's accurate.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.085 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:31:50.085 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's crazy.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.438 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: --I just find
this to be amazing.

00:31:52.438 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do too.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we say goodbye?

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMP: Oh, just
that everybody--

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
this was meant for
everybody to use.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It can be your lifetime
companion guide.

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a
consultant that you

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.770 align:middle line:84%
can consult with and
refer to every time

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:84%
for every month of
your life, really,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.430 align:middle line:90%
in all your relationships.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It's meant to be
there to help us.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm hoping people
will take advantage of it.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.708 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I love it.

00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:20.250 align:middle line:10%
And I want to thank you so much
for dedicating the last three

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:10%
decades of your life to
making this available for us.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:10%
And we will be
seeing more of you.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Thank you.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much, Robert.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMP: Thanks, Regina.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.260 align:middle line:90%
