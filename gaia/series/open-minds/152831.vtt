>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Georgina Cannon

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.827 align:middle line:10%
has facilitated thousands
of past life regressions

00:00:32.827 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:10%
throughout her career,
and has written

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:10%
a book titled "Return Again"
to help people find deeper

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:10%
understanding of this life.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:10%
She's with us today to speak
about the value of exploring

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:10%
past, and interlife
experiences, right

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:10%
on through our relationships
with one another.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Georgina.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.287 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA CANNON: Thank you.

00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I really like
your personal story.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I found it very engaging at
the beginning of the book.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And for you, this entire
journey started with headaches.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:10%
I used to have
terrible migraines--

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:10%
really awful migraines.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.370 align:middle line:10%
They were so debilitating,
I couldn't go into work.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:10%
And I had a career, and so
you had to go in, but I just

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:10%
couldn't.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.207 align:middle line:84%
And when I was learning
past life regression,

00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:90%
it was really interesting.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I asked the person that was
working with me, the student,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.617 align:middle line:84%
to take me through to the place
where my migraines started.

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:90%
We thought we'd try.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know it was
going to work or not.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were thinking
in this life or another life?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Didn't matter.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.738 align:middle line:90%
Just take you back to a time.

00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Take me back
and see where it goes.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So we went back, and
suddenly I could smell

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:90%
this putrid, disgusting smell.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:90%
And I realized it was me.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I had this vision
of this old hag

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
with stringy hair,
virtually no teeth.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I think I had this one
sort of hanging down here.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:90%
And I could smell myself.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:90%
It was really awful.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I probably was about 30 years
old, but looked like 130.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
I was living in a cave,

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and my role was in the village,
just where the cave is.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:84%
My responsibility was to
help people give birth,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.606 align:middle line:84%
or abortions, or
whatever was needed

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:90%
for the women in the group.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But because I was considered a
witch, they wouldn't feed me.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't give me money.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:84%
They only called me
when they needed me.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:90%
So I would go down there.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was called down
to help a woman give birth,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and during that
birth she bled out.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:84%
It was a very difficult birth,
and she bled out and she died,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and her baby died as well.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:90%
It was a young son.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had to bury
them and do everything and make

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:90%
it all tidy and neat.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Went back exhausted to
my cave, fell asleep.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know I'm being
kicked awake by this man who

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
was a husband,
and he'd obviously

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:90%
been drinking something.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.142 align:middle line:84%
And he was furious,
and he was drunk,

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:90%
and he started to beat me up.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And then he picked up this
rock and smashed it right here

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
on the side of my head where
I used to get my migraines.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.204 align:middle line:84%
And the facilitator,
smart enough,

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
did the healing and the
forgiveness and all the work

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that we do in past
life regression

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.450 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of that
sort of thing.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And came out of there and
waited to get another migraine

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:90%
and never had another one.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.524 align:middle line:90%
And that's now 19 years ago.

00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
mean I love regression

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:90%
work for this very reason.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to earlier
in this lifetime.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's
the part I thought,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
now why would you
have manifested

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:84%
that in this lifetime
on a soul level?

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your upbringing
and the head bashings and all,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.887 align:middle line:84%
because really, I was angry
when I read that part.

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:42.687 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:03:42.687 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
My upbringing wasn't
very pleasant.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I now know that my mother
was probably psychotic,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and there were times
in my early life--

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
in fact, I still have scars.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.232 align:middle line:84%
I don't tell many people
about this, just you.

00:03:55.232 --> 00:03:56.438 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:56.438 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:90%
All of us.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And she used
to grab me by the hair

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and smash my head
against the wall,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and then she'd throw
me down the stairs.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was probably five,
six or seven at that time.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And she hit me right
up until the time

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.815 align:middle line:90%
I first went to Canada.

00:04:13.815 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How old were you?

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: I was 20 the
first time I went to Canada.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
still hitting you?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: She was
still hitting me,

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.180 align:middle line:90%
and I was terrified of her.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.721 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
of course you would

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:90%
be terrified of your mother.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.294 align:middle line:84%
How did this factor
in to that other life

00:04:26.294 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:84%
where you were
bashed in the head?

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever tie a thread
through all of this?

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Not at
that time I didn't.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, I now know
that we live in patterns.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: So if
we live in patterns,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.296 align:middle line:84%
and unless you clear it
up in this life, which

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
is what I've done, you're going
to come back and repeat it.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:90%
So why would I want to do that?

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what
about your mother,

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:90%
your situation with the mother?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.095 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever clear that?

00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: With her?

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Couldn't
talk to her.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Once I left, just
couldn't talk to her.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:84%
She told me that I'd be no
good, I'd end up on the streets,

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and who wants me anyway.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm stupid and ugly, and what
good are you, and all of that.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And you believe it.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle line:90%
You believe it.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:90%
You grow up believing it.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're told
that young, these things when

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
you're that young, of
course, you have no filters.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: No filters.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And also up until the age
of about eight or nine,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
you don't even have a
cortex that's developed--

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: --to
appreciate it or know it.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:90%
So you just believe it.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:90%
It becomes your truth.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's the work, of
course, in hypnosis.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:84%
As you know, when you do
that, you take a person back,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:90%
and you change that memory.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:84%
You change that decision that
they have that someone else

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.189 align:middle line:84%
gave them, that label
that was given to them.

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's important
that you brought up the notion

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
that there are these
parallels that continue,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:84%
these patterns that continue
until they're broken.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And they could go on
for many lifetimes.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.060 align:middle line:84%
They can go on for
many lifetimes.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
They can also go on in many
relationships in this lifetime.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: So if people have
been a victim in a past life,

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and they come in--

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and victim as a slave, or
even a very wealthy woman

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.730 align:middle line:84%
in Victorian times
who had no choices.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:84%
They come into this lifetime
as a family who makes

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:90%
them a victim of some sort.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And then they choose partners
who become victim, victim,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
victim, victim, all the way
along until they get it,

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.605 align:middle line:84%
until they understand
that they have a pattern,

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to do
something about it.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was an emotional
component to that.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
You were already an outcast
in the village, right?

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
already considered

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
less than nothing,
however they needed you

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:90%
for this one specific function.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And now you had this incredible
venom directed at you as well.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So you were worthless
in that society.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Um-hmm.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were worthless
in your mother's eyes, too.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Um-hmm.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other piece
that you're not aware of

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
is that when we
moved out of London,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
we moved to a small village,
and we were the only

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Jewish family in the village.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Family-- it was my sister,
and myself, and my mother,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
because my mother had
thrown my father out.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:84%
She'd beaten him up
and thrown him out.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: It was charming.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Too bad she
hadn't thrown you out.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.726 align:middle line:84%
You could have been
free of her earlier.

00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And because we
were the only Jewish family

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
in the village, we were
treated a bit like pariahs.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.029 align:middle line:84%
So it was exactly the
same pattern repeated.

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This rejection.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.477 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes, rejection.

00:07:06.477 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: You don't belong.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you figured
this out for yourself.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Your migraines went away.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.880 align:middle line:84%
You've gone on to do
thousands of regressions.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to pick up
the story where it begins,

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:90%
which is when we make the--

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.627 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe a little
after it begins.

00:07:23.627 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:90%
We'll get around to that--

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
when a person, a
being, entity, decides

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.800 align:middle line:84%
to enter into our
physical lives.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And let's start with
the choice of parents.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The choice of
parents really come

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
from the understanding of what
it is you're here to learn.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:90%
The soul's lessons.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:90%
What you're here to learn.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you have to learn a
situation like humility,

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
for instance, you
might choose parents

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:90%
that cause you to be humble.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And then in this
lifetime, you have

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:84%
to learn that there's a
difference between humility

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.117 align:middle line:90%
and being denigrated to nothing.

00:08:03.117 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:90%
So you have to change the label.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:90%
You have to work with labeling.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
interesting process,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:84%
because what we're doing
is working with people,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
by and large, who
don't understand

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:90%
the link between then and now.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Whether the then and now is in
a past life, or the then and now

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
is when you were in your
mother's womb, or at age two.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.071 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Um-hmm.

00:08:23.071 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: You've
still got to understand

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:84%
that pattern and that link,
and then go back to the source

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:84%
so that you get the story
and then take hold of it.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:90%
And don't live the story.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Live your life.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So OK, let's start when the
soul actually physically

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:90%
becomes connected with the body.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Some people
believe that it happens

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of conception.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe it
happens along the root,

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.970 align:middle line:84%
once the soul has
decided to come in.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it happens
at the moment of birth.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it happens an hour
or two or 12 after birth.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.587 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the baby
may be born seemingly dead,

00:09:07.587 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
but they have to revive
it, and they do revive it,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and the soul decides, oh
well, I might as well.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I've been present
for a few births,

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing
reflexology on the mother.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Feet or the hand?

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The feet, yeah.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And using some understanding
of color therapy with it,

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and it was very interesting.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But the point being that
once the baby arrived,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
there is this thing
that people seem

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to experience where there's
the body that's coming out,

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
but there's a still point
before this animation happens.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And the animation doesn't
even have to mean movement.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:90%
It's like a flush.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.115 align:middle line:90%
Something happens.

00:09:48.115 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: It's an energy.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And an energy,
and then boom, a new life

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.420 align:middle line:90%
is in the world.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Um-hmm.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that has
certainly, in my experience,

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.040 align:middle line:84%
seems to be that the physical
joining is something's

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.607 align:middle line:84%
definitely happening
at that point.

00:10:01.607 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Well,
it's like watching--

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Palliative care
nurses will tell you

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.550 align:middle line:84%
what that they see
the soul leave.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: You
feel it in the room.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: So the
soul decides to either

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:90%
be in this house or not.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what it's about.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of
the other aspects of soul,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:90%
and that has to do with--

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:90%
say the mother has made--

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's say the soul
has decided in utero,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:90%
it's changed its mind.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't want to take this
vehicle and this pathway.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:90%
And it happens a lot.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, my mentor, a
wonderful, wild Russian woman

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
who was 40 years older than me
years ago, my ballet teacher

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.456 align:middle line:84%
had had several miscarriages
before she finally had a baby.

00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I can see
why they might have

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.160 align:middle line:90%
changed their mind with her.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't the best mom.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Great friend and eccentric.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Sure.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:84%
It's really interesting because
what happens is the soul,

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:84%
it suggested that
it's time to come in.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And the soul may say, yeah,
I guess I do have to go in.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
I do have to learn to
be a hero, not a victim.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll choose these things.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets into the
body, and it says, uh-uh,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:90%
changed my mind.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.296 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's the most
common time where that happens?

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:90%
It can happen at three months.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.085 align:middle line:84%
It can happen at six
months, and nine months.

00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:33.835 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at the
end of the trimesters.

00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: End
of the trimester.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Even afterwards.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So there can be a 24-hour
turnaround when the soul may

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:90%
come in, in the body.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:90%
The body is born.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And then it's here,
and it suddenly

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
thinks what the heck
am I doing here?

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.583 align:middle line:90%
What was I thinking.

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: I want to go
home, and it goes home.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Talking about this is very
difficult, because as you know,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.639 align:middle line:84%
the grief that goes around
with this is unimaginable.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
it from the other side then.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.055 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: The other side.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have the
entity, the spirit's; the soul's

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:90%
choice.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.286 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Which has gone home.

00:12:07.286 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:90%
It's happy.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which has gone home.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It's happy.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But you've vested a lot as
the mother or the parents

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.339 align:middle line:90%
in this growing little baby.

00:12:14.339 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: That's right.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And also the body's changed.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
body's changed, yeah.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.195 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: So you're
dealing with the body changes

00:12:20.195 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:84%
or the hormonal
changes and everything.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing
with expectations,

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
both of the mother and
the father and the family,

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.880 align:middle line:90%
and the world around--

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:90%
expectations.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly there's a vacuum,
like a black hole that's left.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder sometimes if
that's the purpose of that,

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
so that the person can
learn how to handle grief.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making light of it.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Please understand.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm not--

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: This is so painful.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're just
talking about it as it is.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: OK.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a way that
the woman and the father

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:84%
can understand that
it's a soul choice,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.160 align:middle line:90%
it's nothing they did wrong.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.961 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:13:03.961 --> 00:13:05.376 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And
women particularly

00:13:05.376 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
are inclined to
take on that blame.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Did I not eat properly?

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Did I do something wrong?

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: I worked too hard.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I worked too long.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
fact is human beings

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
have been around a long
time, and our bodies

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.587 align:middle line:84%
have borne children under really
severe stresses and famines

00:13:21.587 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if an entity wants
to come through, the fact

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:84%
that you had a glass of
champagne or two the night

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
the baby was conceived,
it's not on that.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:90%
And I hear what you're saying.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very important
for the mother to realize this.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And that for the
family to realize it's

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:84%
nothing that you did
that caused this.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:90%
It was the soul's choice.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And you may feel bereft, as we
do when we lose any loved one,

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:84%
but this is even worse because
the expectation around it's

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:90%
so high.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
But understand the soul
has gone home, and it's OK.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of the lines in your
book I thought was interesting.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:84%
The soul obviously has
access to knowledge

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:90%
from the side it's on.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And it has made this
original agreement

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.559 align:middle line:84%
to occupy this
vehicle, so to speak.

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's looking at
it in a little bit

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
more pragmatic terms, but
this is what it said here.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.090 align:middle line:84%
It said, it's their
life and the life

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:26.420 align:middle line:84%
must be most reasonably
manageable and achievable.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
key sentence.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.100 align:middle line:84%
When the soul is
evaluating, even

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:84%
in utero, what
they've gotten into,

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.215 align:middle line:90%
can they really pull this off?

00:14:34.215 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Yeah,
are they ready?

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.548 align:middle line:90%
Are they strong enough?

00:14:36.548 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Have they learned
enough in the interlife?

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Have they settled enough?

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Have they gone
through enough wisdom?

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Are they ready?

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Or are they still too
bruised from before?

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now we're
going through the birth process,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:90%
we're here in the world.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And before we go into kind of
anecdotal experiences and such,

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe toward the end we can
talk about that interlife period

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:90%
between incarnations.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Um-hmm.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.844 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we'll go
there in a little bit.

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:84%
But let's go ahead and talk
about the guidance that's

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:84%
happening with the
entity on the other side,

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
before they've
chosen to come in.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, the entity has a
choice, but they're also

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
working with guiding counsels
and such, prior to this, right?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And give us some experiences
that people have reflected back

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:90%
on an interlife regression.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Well, I always
equate the interlife

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
as you know when you
go into a graveyard

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and you see gravestones, and
it says, Robert Brown, 1912 to,

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:90%
dash, 19 whatever.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:84%
The interlife is the
dash between past lives.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So what happens between
those past lives?

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens is
the soul goes home.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And when the client
goes into the interlife,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:84%
it is so awe-inspiring and
so deeply moving, sometimes

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.510 align:middle line:90%
they weep.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:90%
They're going home.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:90%
And there's nothing like it.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling of completion.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling of peace.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling of
understanding and recognition

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are truly so
much more than we seem.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.292 align:middle line:84%
Even though we've
said it before,

00:16:23.292 --> 00:16:25.750 align:middle line:84%
even though people that come
from past life sort of kind of

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:84%
know it, the interlife
makes the difference,

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:90%
because they then really get it.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:33.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we can connect.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.521 align:middle line:84%
That's why mediums
could connect because we

00:16:35.521 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:90%
go to that same place.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.107 align:middle line:90%
We go home.

00:16:38.107 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it can be
any number of experiences.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
It can be a really
bizarre experience

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:90%
to be in the interlife.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:84%
What do you call
that place that's

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.850 align:middle line:84%
kind of just off this realm
where you're in between sleep

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:90%
and wakefulness?

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily in
a regressed state,

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
where you can be in a field
of plaid or shining lights

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.239 align:middle line:90%
What is that area within us?

00:16:59.239 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a lot of times
where the inspirations and such

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:90%
come true as well.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Well, that's
the superconscious.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what I call
the superconscious.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:90%
That a part of it.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just beyond
the subconscious

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:84%
is the superconscious, just
before we go into that space.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we often
get our inspiration.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
get our creativity.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
That's where we get our deep
wisdom and understanding.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
That's where I believe that
the wisdom that's passed on

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:90%
from generations is stored.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.817 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
call it Akashic records,

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:84%
or you can call it a
lot of different things.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I think the Akashic records are
the library in the interlife.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But that space in
between is where

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
we go when we want
to recall something.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Aboriginal
tribes say that they

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.240 align:middle line:90%
call on their ancestors.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:84%
That's where they go
when they get the wisdom

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.780 align:middle line:90%
from their ancestors.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
It's that space where all
knowledge and wisdom is stored.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the space.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's the
space just before.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That little
band in between

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: --the
band in between.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
agree with you on that.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So as we're incarnating,
we're coming into a family,

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:84%
we've chosen these families
for a variety of reasons.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And there we can get into some
anecdotal information where

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.914 align:middle line:84%
people have gone through,
or a couple of cases

00:18:22.914 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
you can think of maybe,
where people have gone

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:84%
through the birth process,
very specifically choosing

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:84%
those traits for that family
to express into the world.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
some of the decisions

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
people have had in their birth
process regressions and such?

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Sure.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're always
unhappily negative.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people don't come
because they're happy.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't come and
say, I'm really happy,

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:90%
I've got a superb life.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.117 align:middle line:90%
Let's find out why.

00:18:50.117 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it's true.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you talk about
people go through rebirthing

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:84%
experiences or whatever, it's
like oh, they're hanging on

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:90%
by their fingernails.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.371 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: That's right.

00:19:00.371 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have a
client who literally

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:84%
went from one relationship
to another relationship

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:84%
to another, and they were
all abusive in some way,

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
addictive in some way.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't know why.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And she thought it
was a past life.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, sometimes it's past life.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it isn't.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's to do with
patterning that they picked up

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So I always clear
that first, because I

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.390 align:middle line:84%
don't believe in
allowing my clients

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:84%
to take what I call psychic
diversion or psychic bypass.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not always past life.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's what
happens in this life

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:90%
and you've picked up a pattern.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.120 align:middle line:90%
So we do the exploration first.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And if it is past
life, then we go back.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So with this particular woman,
she ended up in a past life

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.430 align:middle line:90%
where she was a slave.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And she was a slave,
an elite slave,

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.930 align:middle line:84%
which meant she worked
in the house, which

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
meant she was at
the beck and call

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:84%
of the master of the house, of
course, who would get drunk.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And she found her way out by
making this man so drunk--

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:84%
she would encourage
him to drink--

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:90%
that he became impotent.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:90%
So she never had to do anything.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she did
at the beginning,

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
but she learned
how to manage him.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:84%
She learned how to handle
him and make it work for her.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So what we did is we took that
piece of learning how to make

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.894 align:middle line:84%
it work for you,
whatever the 'it' is--

00:20:33.894 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in
this case, abuse.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Abuse, right.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.814 align:middle line:84%
And bringing it into
your current life.

00:20:37.814 --> 00:20:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So she now was set up in this
current life to the first

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.380 align:middle line:84%
moment she recognized the first
sign of abuse in her dating,

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
so if someone over-talked her,
or someone just became verbally

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.565 align:middle line:84%
abusive in any way, or
even diminished her--

00:20:53.565 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Putting her down.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Putting
her down, she

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:01.010 align:middle line:84%
would learn-- she knew that she
had to take charge- and manage

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:90%
it, and get out of there.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.549 align:middle line:90%
It was a big lesson for her.

00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe
she would have got that

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.549 align:middle line:90%
without that past life thing.

00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:11.006 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think you're right
because they're so visceral.

00:21:11.006 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:84%
When you're in it, it's as
real as sitting here right now.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Exactly.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So when people say, was that
really true or did I make it

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:84%
up, which is a question
people always ask,

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:84%
my answer is in
reality, does it matter?

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Because as long as
you've got the wisdom,

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and as long as you understand
the learning, and you get it,

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.630 align:middle line:90%
my guess is that it's real.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.419 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
think it's real,

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
you've got the information, what
are you going to do with it?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to
integrate that information

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:90%
into your life?

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.978 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
important thing

00:21:41.978 --> 00:21:44.150 align:middle line:90%
I think in regression work.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:84%
When I used to do
that for people

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and assist them in regressions,
I used to tell them,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:90%
don't worry what story shows up.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask yourself
if this is real.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact is, your being
is presenting this story to you

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
for a reason,
whether it's literal

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a metaphor
for something really doesn't

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:90%
matter.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the knowledge you need
to know about yourself anyway.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And then people can relax a
little bit, don't you find?

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.886 align:middle line:90%
They just can relax then.

00:22:08.886 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Oh, I find once they
don't have to prove anything--

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.321 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Prove anything.

00:22:11.321 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to give them the
address of your previous home

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.834 align:middle line:90%
120 years ago.

00:22:16.834 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Although
we do do that, too.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
people do do that.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask
about a couple of those

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.526 align:middle line:84%
because that's
really interesting.

00:22:22.526 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The work of Carol Bowman,
"Children's Past Lives."

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Oh, her
work is brilliant.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ian Stevenson.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I just
wanted to toss out this,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
because we incarnate
into a family

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.775 align:middle line:84%
and we think oh, we've
got all their traits.

00:22:37.775 --> 00:22:39.620 align:middle line:90%
We're just a composite of them.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Casey's quote was, "You've
inherited most from yourself,

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:90%
not from your family."

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again, that's
really important to understand.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:90%
This is a sovereign experience.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.930 align:middle line:84%
You've chosen that family to
have an experience through,

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:90%
but you're bringing you through.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.036 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: You're
bringing you through.

00:22:56.036 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, and I
absolutely work that way,

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I also work with clients
in DNA regression.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, now, that's next.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Talk about it.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Am I jumping ahead?

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.030 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: So with DNA
regression, supposing--

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and this is exactly
what happened--

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.099 align:middle line:84%
someone comes in and they
have terrible anger issues.

00:23:18.099 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:90%
They don't where it comes from.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.755 align:middle line:84%
They come from a lovely family,
they believe it's all good,

00:23:22.755 --> 00:23:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
how to handle it.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So I say, was anybody in your
family known for their rages?

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, my grandfather
was known or whatever.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back, and we
do the DNA regression.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:84%
After we get into
visualize it and go back,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:90%
and decide not to take it on.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Change the decision at
the point of decision,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.245 align:middle line:84%
and change it to something
more manageable for you today.

00:23:47.245 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can maybe get
angry if it's appropriate,

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you laugh,
or whatever it is.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It's your choice.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So make the choice at
that moment of decision

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:90%
and change the decision.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And sometimes we go
back five or six generations.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Um-hmm.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And also my understanding is
that when people reincarnate,

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.950 align:middle line:84%
they're often also
following DNA patterns that

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:90%
are familiar to them.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So often you can incarnate
back into the same gene pool,

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
even into the same bloodline,
even into the same family.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's not really
that they're chasing genetics,

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
as much as the patterns that
have already been established,

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and the relationships that
have already been established

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:84%
are what people are coming back
into to maybe balance back out.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:90%
How do you describe that?

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: They can
either choose to do that,

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
the soul has choice--

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
choose to do that to
show them the lesson.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.290 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a soul
going [SHAKING FINGER],,

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:90%
don't do that again.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Which is sort of funny.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that again.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm the soul.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that again.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So they choose to come back into
a familiar ethos, if you will,

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:90%
a familiar environment.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Similar opportunities.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:57.565 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Similar
opportunities.

00:24:57.565 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Similar lessons.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And maybe
even similar voices.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:02.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, the father has
the same type of voice,

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:90%
or the father--

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Similar voice, and
it feels familiar,

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:84%
so they come on
in, it's familiar,

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:90%
like a familiar coffee shop.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.567 align:middle line:84%
They go in, they check it
out, decide to take it,

00:25:15.567 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and then the same
thing happens again.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So now, soul says, what are you
going to do about it this time?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.475 align:middle line:84%
Come on, what are you going
to do about it this time?

00:25:24.475 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't listen,
guess what, you have

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.586 align:middle line:90%
to come back and do it again.

00:25:27.586 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So whether it go
through the DNA,

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it go through the
soul, it's the same story.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yeah, same story.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
situations where--

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going ask you about
your famous Cleopatra

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.048 align:middle line:90%
client in a little bit.

00:25:40.048 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: [LAUGH]

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about
the situations where people

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.880 align:middle line:84%
come in, and often
may think that they

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:84%
are someone recognizable
that's gone down in history.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they weren't
necessarily that person,

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.660 align:middle line:84%
but what is it--
and they can recall

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:84%
in detail even what
the household was like

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and the players
and the feelings.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Get into that and maybe
give an example or two

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of what they're
actually tapping into.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: What they're
tapping into is the,

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe, the want or
the need to model what

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:90%
they admire about that person.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:84%
We do it in our current
life, and there's

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
a part of us that wants
to be in a certain way,

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
a certain environment, a
certain behavior pattern.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:90%
It could be courage.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:90%
It could be intelligence.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So we choose to believe,
to imagine, to feel,

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.800 align:middle line:90%
that we are them.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.482 align:middle line:84%
And that can be transferred
into the subconscious mind.

00:26:46.482 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
when they actually--

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know a person
who is actually

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:84%
high profile, so I don't want
to name names at this point.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But he has the knowledge
base of another person

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that's very high
profile, that's dead--

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:90%
long dead.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:90%
He has that knowledge.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:84%
He has a lot of
those remembrances.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.297 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Remember that
narrow piece in between?

00:27:14.297 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Um-hmm.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.671 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: That's where all
the information is stored.

00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:19.350 align:middle line:84%
If you have the
ability to channel--

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:90%
I won't use the word channel--

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.170 align:middle line:84%
tap into it, bring it,
then you can call it down,

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.480 align:middle line:84%
if the direction
is strong enough.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
If you have that want and
that will strong enough,

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.400 align:middle line:90%
you can call it down.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who,
ever since she was tiny,

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.210 align:middle line:90%
wanted to be a nurse.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And she read everything she
knew about Florence Nightingale,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and she believed she was
Florence Nightingale.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
We haven't done a past
life, but maybe she was,

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:90%
maybe she wasn't.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And so in this sense,
if this person who

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.030 align:middle line:84%
was fascinated
from the time they

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.820 align:middle line:84%
were a little child with this
particular area of technology,

00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
for example, has the ability
to a) invent technology

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, so already
able to draw down.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.496 align:middle line:90%
And understand it.

00:28:05.496 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they may be an
admirer of the contributions

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:90%
of the person from before.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:84%
You're saying they go
into that space in between

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.834 align:middle line:84%
and simply draw down the
actual thoughts and knowledge

00:28:13.834 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and memories that were taking
place for that other person.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.658 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can
feel like it is your own.

00:28:18.658 --> 00:28:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: It is your own.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
We have to acknowledge
the fact that there

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:84%
are teams of scientists
in Australia,

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
teams of scientists in Germany,
teams of scientists in North

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
America all working
on the same thing,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know they're
working on the same thing.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And they all come to the same
solution at the same time,

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:90%
because it's here.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:90%
It's all there for us.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:84%
If we are driven
and we're focused,

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:90%
then we know how to tap into it.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.080 align:middle line:90%
My belief system.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes perfect sense.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Before we go any
further, what was

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:84%
it in you that started
giving validity

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:90%
to the notion of past lives?

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.374 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: I grew
up in England.

00:29:01.374 --> 00:29:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.984 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: So we
believe in ghosts,

00:29:03.984 --> 00:29:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and we believe that a fairy's
at the bottom of the garden.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And we believe
in goblins and all of that.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.280 align:middle line:90%
So I never didn't believe in it.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.456 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: It's like auras.

00:29:14.456 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see auras,
and I never didn't

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.874 align:middle line:84%
know that nobody else did
until I went to school.

00:29:19.874 --> 00:29:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you
go into the corporate world

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and you learn to shut it
down because you can't say,

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:90%
excuse me, but you're lying.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: It doesn't
go down too well.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can see
it in your aura.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Now I bring it
up again, so it's great.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
go to Cleopatra,

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and let's go to these
archetypal famous,

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.240 align:middle line:84%
famous lifetimes
that so many people--

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.062 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many
Mary Magdalenes I've met.

00:29:42.062 --> 00:29:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Oh, really.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I live
in Sedona, so you

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.330 align:middle line:84%
meet a lot of Mary Magdalenes
and Jesus' and things

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.402 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:29:50.402 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: They may
have been followers,

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.026 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] followers.

00:29:53.026 --> 00:29:55.411 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is what I
wanted to get into as well.

00:29:55.411 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:84%
That's true, they
may very well have

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:84%
been there and
experienced a lot of it,

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.680 align:middle line:84%
or been very close
to the person.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you say, have such
a deep admiration or respect

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:84%
that you transfer over that
need into being that person.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.479 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your
client Cleopatra.

00:30:11.479 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGINA: I smile when I
think about her, because she

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:10%
was so fervent,
and she showed up

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:10%
in the clinic wearing
a necklace that

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:10%
was sort of brass like this.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:90%
She had a headband on.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And her hair was sort
of down and dark.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.775 align:middle line:90%
And she carried herself--

00:30:28.775 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As a queen would.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: --as a queen.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And well, I know
I was Cleopatra,

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
but I just want
to experience it.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.810 align:middle line:90%
So I said, fine, OK.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's make sure that
we don't direct it.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's make sure that we go
wherever, because sometimes--

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.470 align:middle line:90%
and I said this--

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a soul takes
us where we need to go,

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and we may end up there
or we may start there.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's just be clear.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.889 align:middle line:84%
So she went through the hypnosis
process, except she didn't.

00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean you could see she was
moving, and you know this.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.540 align:middle line:84%
You can tell from the
face and everything.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:90%
I said, where are you now?

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.676 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a barge.

00:31:04.676 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:90%
And who are you with?

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, my handmaidens, of course.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And were you going
to see Marc Antony?

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.660 align:middle line:90%
And Marc Antony is?

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And you see, I happen
to be a history buff,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.380 align:middle line:84%
so I know a bit
about this stuff.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:90%
And Marc Antony is?

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's my lover, of course.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.220 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And have you been married
or are you married?

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.790 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.570 align:middle line:90%
He's the only man in my life.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, you and I know that
she married her brother.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.182 align:middle line:90%
She was a busy lady.

00:31:32.182 --> 00:31:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was busy.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:90%
She had a lot of desires.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: A very busy woman.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.323 align:middle line:84%
She married her
brother, she married--

00:31:38.323 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:90%
name gone out of my head--

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Caesar.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Caesar.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I know I was
thinking Caesar.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Caesar, yeah.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.086 align:middle line:90%
And she was busy.

00:31:46.086 --> 00:31:47.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, she was busy.

00:31:47.335 --> 00:31:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And I let
her live that through

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.070 align:middle line:90%
because she needed to.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Then put her into the space
between lifetimes, and--

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:84%
oh, by the way, I
forgot the piece.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.450 align:middle line:84%
When she came in, I said, do
you have any fears or phobias?

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.850 align:middle line:84%
She said, yes, I have a
terrible fear of horses.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.800 align:middle line:90%
And I'm also frightened of fire.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.640 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't
like fire at all.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I can't go to camp fires
and things like that.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So we were in the space
between lifetimes,

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and then she came in again,
and she was a pioneer woman

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:90%
on a wagon train.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.913 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing was
her whole demeanor changed

00:32:25.913 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:90%
and her voice changed.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.294 align:middle line:90%
She suddenly wasn't posing.

00:32:28.294 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cleopatra anymore.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: She wasn't posing.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And her face went into
hypnosis, and you could

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.670 align:middle line:90%
see her eyelids fluttering.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we're
on a wagon train

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and we're going West,
my husband and I.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:42.930 align:middle line:90%
The children are in the back.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And she knew how many
there were in the train.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly they were attacked
by a band of native people

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:84%
who set fire to the
wagons, and she could

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.820 align:middle line:90%
hear the horses screaming.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
There were tears
running down her face.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.570 align:middle line:84%
She was frightened, she could
hear the horses screaming.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And she died as a
captive in that raid.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And when she came out,
she was so stunned,

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and she said, well,
what was that?

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.199 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
that was past life.

00:33:13.199 --> 00:33:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we did all the
healing and the lessons

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:90%
needed to learn.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.609 align:middle line:84%
We also got rid of
the fear of fire,

00:33:17.609 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and we got rid of the fear of
horses, because that was then.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And she said,
well, what about Cleopatra?

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
you know sometimes--

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:84%
which is what we
talked about before--

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:33.030 align:middle line:84%
sometimes because we admire
someone so much, we model them,

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and we take on that
part of them that we

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.254 align:middle line:90%
like to own for ourselves.

00:33:37.254 --> 00:33:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So she said, are you
telling me it's not true?

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.214 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, it's not
what I'm telling you.

00:33:41.214 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you
for you it's true,

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and for you it makes sense, and
for you it enhances your life

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.910 align:middle line:90%
in some way that only you know.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But we know that this
pioneer woman is you.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.130 align:middle line:90%
And she was OK with that.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:90%
She was OK with that.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:00.657 align:middle line:84%
But the difference in
the two manifestations.

00:34:00.657 --> 00:34:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One was
authentic and one was not.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:03.870 align:middle line:90%
As you say, it was posing.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: It was posing.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah--

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Determined.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.395 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --a desire.

00:34:06.395 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was the desire
more than anything.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.929 align:middle line:84%
What about people who have
been in the presence of others

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:17.010 align:middle line:84%
who were in these prominent
positions of history?

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had
clients that perhaps

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.181 align:middle line:84%
were the handmaiden to
Cleopatra and so forth?

00:34:23.181 --> 00:34:24.639 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: I'm
trying to remember.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I've done so many of them.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.644 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to remember.

00:34:27.644 --> 00:34:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
sometimes-- the reason

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:32.621 align:middle line:84%
I ask while you're thinking
about it is history is written

00:34:32.621 --> 00:34:33.704 align:middle line:90%
by the victors, of course.

00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:33.896 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:34:33.896 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.709 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have
very, very-- in male,

00:34:35.709 --> 00:34:38.019 align:middle line:90%
we have very distorted history.

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: And educated.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.929 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes some of
the more reliable means

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.770 align:middle line:84%
of piecing together what our
ancient history actually looked

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
like is through
regression work, which

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I have a deep appreciation
for, especially where

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.409 align:middle line:90%
groups of people--

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
people, I should
say individuals who

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.440 align:middle line:90%
don't even know each other--

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.187 align:middle line:84%
start giving glimpses of
the same story that emerges.

00:35:02.187 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever experienced
anything like that

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.282 align:middle line:84%
where unrelated clients
might be coming up

00:35:06.282 --> 00:35:07.240 align:middle line:90%
with something similar?

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: I've had a few--

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.800 align:middle line:84%
not few, maybe two
or three people--

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:84%
who had been followers of
the man they called Jesus.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And the languaging is
very different to what we

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.950 align:middle line:90%
experience in stories of Jesus.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Because he was a wanderer,
according to these people.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:84%
He was a wanderer that came
from a very small village.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:33.249 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of many
who did what he did.

00:35:33.249 --> 00:35:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And some-- I guess it was a bit
like the rock groups of those

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:36.840 align:middle line:90%
days--

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.390 align:middle line:84%
some people attach
to different people

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:41.850 align:middle line:90%
through their personalities.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.730 align:middle line:84%
There was one woman who
was in love with him

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.872 align:middle line:90%
because she saw him as--

00:35:46.872 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle line:84%
But she followed him, and
she followed him from place

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:90%
to place.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they ate,
sometimes they didn't.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.620 align:middle line:90%
And she loved him.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.970 align:middle line:84%
She loved his gentleness
and his kindness,

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:90%
and she loved the way he spoke.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:35:59.730 align:middle line:90%
So she was--

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was
an authentic experience

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:03.690 align:middle line:84%
from all of the telltale
signs of regression.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:84%
But I've not got any
closer than that,

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.649 align:middle line:90%
that I can remember right now.

00:36:09.649 --> 00:36:11.190 align:middle line:84%
If I went through
my notes, I might--

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Because
sometimes, like you said,

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.356 align:middle line:84%
two or three people
that were followers.

00:36:14.356 --> 00:36:15.494 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:36:15.494 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if there were
any kind of like common themes

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.285 align:middle line:84%
that come up out of that,
even with two or three people.

00:36:20.285 --> 00:36:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Awe is
the common theme.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Awe.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Awe, and the need
to follow something greater

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.860 align:middle line:90%
than themselves.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And
sometimes that even--

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.500 align:middle line:84%
now you're reminding
me-- sometimes that even

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.910 align:middle line:90%
transmutes over to this life.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How so?

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: I am sure
you've noticed this.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.150 align:middle line:84%
There are some people who
have to be at the front,

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.566 align:middle line:84%
and there's some people who
don't want to be at the front.

00:36:45.566 --> 00:36:47.452 align:middle line:84%
They're very good
second in commands,

00:36:47.452 --> 00:36:48.910 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want
to be up there.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And in
business, quite often it's

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:52.455 align:middle line:84%
the woman who's
behind, or used to be--

00:36:52.455 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:84%
not anymore-- but behind the
scenes who would do that.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I remember
one of my clients

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:90%
when I was in the PR business.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.090 align:middle line:84%
One of my clients
was a guy who was--

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.260 align:middle line:90%
everybody loved him.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Everybody liked him.

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But he had a really
nasty man working for him

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:84%
who every time he would
say yes, of course,

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:84%
we will, this guy would
follow along a week later

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and say no, we're
not going to do it.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's that type of
dichotomy that some people

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:84%
need to be a follower,
whether they be kind about it

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and help this person out
of a difficult situation,

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:84%
or whether they be the bad
person that allows that person

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.590 align:middle line:90%
to shine.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And that can show up
in your choice of lives

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.710 align:middle line:84%
that you've had before
as well, I think.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Because we live in patterns.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I saw one that was
interesting, one pattern

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.490 align:middle line:90%
with a friend, a man.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And he had had some
regression work done, and also

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.420 align:middle line:84%
a past life reading
through a reputable person.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And it showed a
pattern of military,

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.100 align:middle line:84%
of being very powerful, very
strategic, but always second.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So he took the orders
from someone else,

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and then he was given the
resources and the troops

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and free reign to do
this over and over again.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.040 align:middle line:84%
To the point in this
lifetime of being

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:11.210 align:middle line:84%
virtually incapable of knowing
how to survive in the world.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And I find that interesting
because if we've

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.320 align:middle line:84%
had various patterns as
men, and patterns as women

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.140 align:middle line:84%
available to us over the
course of many lifetimes,

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and we kind of have gone
off in one direction,

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and you find yourself
in the modern age,

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:84%
you don't really have
any useful skill sets,

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.434 align:middle line:90%
and oftentimes people feel lost.

00:38:29.434 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: They feel lost
and they feel victimized,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.670 align:middle line:90%
and they're not sure why.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.095 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: People
come into the clinic

00:38:35.095 --> 00:38:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and they say I've been sad
ever since I can remember.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I was born sad, you know.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Just I was sad, or I've
been feeling guilty

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:90%
as long as I can remember.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Even as a child I felt
guilty about something.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.490 align:middle line:90%
So that is obviously past life.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we take that
as a nugget, and we

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:84%
follow that back and ask
the soul for permission

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:84%
to go back to the lives
and the patterns that

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.349 align:middle line:90%
will lead us to understanding.

00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
big deal, breaking

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:84%
those kind of gender-based
societal programs in all us,

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and often feeling
like there's no way

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:84%
to express who you
are in the world,

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.310 align:middle line:84%
because that particular vehicle
isn't in mode of operation

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.780 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And we
also forget that we

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:90%
didn't have conversation.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.657 align:middle line:84%
Conversation is
comparatively recent.

00:39:25.657 --> 00:39:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Well, it's a
couple of hundred years

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.800 align:middle line:84%
maybe, because before
that, you spoke

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.520 align:middle line:90%
when you needed something.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I need food.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:90%
We need fire.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:90%
We need this.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Work.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.330 align:middle line:84%
It was the French Courts that
started that, that started

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:42.735 align:middle line:90%
the art of conversation.

00:39:42.735 --> 00:39:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe the
Greek schools of philosophy

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:90%
along the way, of course.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: But that's teaching.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.505 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, [INAUDIBLE]
teaching and dialogue.

00:39:48.505 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in terms of
friendly conversation--

00:39:50.485 --> 00:39:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Friendly
conversation.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Talking about--

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:52.775 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --banal conversation.

00:39:52.775 --> 00:39:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: There you go.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And the building
of relationships.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.750 align:middle line:84%
The whole building
of relationships

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.580 align:middle line:90%
is comparatively recent.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
it, people got married

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.910 align:middle line:84%
because it was convenient, or it
was necessary to bring families

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:14.700 align:middle line:84%
together, or it was we needed
children to work the farm.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a contract.

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.053 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: It's only
comparatively recently

00:40:19.053 --> 00:40:21.042 align:middle line:90%
that we get to choose.

00:40:21.042 --> 00:40:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And we don't choose
very well a lot of the time.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
like any adolescent, woo!

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:30.189 align:middle line:84%
The world is your candy
shop because it's a new--

00:40:30.189 --> 00:40:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: That's right.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: I can't tell
you how many clients

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I have who come into
the clinic who say,

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Georgina, why do I
always choose losers?

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It must be a past life.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.520 align:middle line:90%
And I say, maybe, maybe not.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.220 align:middle line:90%
What is a loser to you?

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.360 align:middle line:90%
What makes a loser?

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And why do you keep
going down that path?

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at that.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it a past life?

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.922 align:middle line:84%
Is it a pattern that
we need to break?

00:40:56.922 --> 00:40:59.255 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something you need
to recognize about yourself?

00:40:59.255 --> 00:41:01.734 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.734 --> 00:41:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yeah.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.233 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the
notion, because in a little bit

00:41:05.233 --> 00:41:08.270 align:middle line:84%
we're going to segue
over to your new book,

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.400 align:middle line:90%
because I love regression--

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I read that one, but we're
going to talk about the new one,

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.990 align:middle line:90%
it's "You, Me, Relationship."

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's start
talking about soulmates,

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.750 align:middle line:84%
because you dedicate
some space in your book

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:84%
to the subject of
soulmates, which

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:26.450 align:middle line:84%
is such a misused and
misunderstood concept.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yeah.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Soulmates are really people
who help the soul grow.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So they can be a
neighbor who's friendly,

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.610 align:middle line:84%
or they can be a neighbor
who's irascible and nasty, so

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.240 align:middle line:84%
that your soul learns to
manage that and maybe forgive

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.890 align:middle line:90%
and allow.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Soulmates can be someone
you've known for 15 minutes.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.480 align:middle line:84%
They can be the
love of your life

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.460 align:middle line:90%
that you live with forever.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Or they can be the teacher
that you had at school.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that helps
your soul grow,

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:59.420 align:middle line:84%
anybody that helps you evolve
and get towards involvement

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:04.090 align:middle line:84%
to the higher level of soul
growth, that's a soulmate.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.440 align:middle line:84%
When people come into
the clinic and they say,

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.570 align:middle line:90%
I think I've met my soulmate.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I was at a party last night
and we just connected.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.620 align:middle line:84%
We clicked like we
were glued together.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.320 align:middle line:84%
We knew everything
about each other,

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
even though we've never
spoken to each other.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.955 align:middle line:90%
Part of me is going uh-oh.

00:42:18.955 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
in for some fun.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.202 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:21.202 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Some learning.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: This is--
yeah, this is fun,

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and this is going
to be interesting as

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:32.540 align:middle line:84%
to which part of
you is patterning

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.990 align:middle line:84%
that you resonated with
that isn't necessarily good.

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I find that's
interesting when people

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.820 align:middle line:84%
have that kind of
instant recognition

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and everything's hot, and all
that right in the beginning.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.730 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's almost
like the come hither,

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:50.220 align:middle line:84%
energetic call to come and learn
what you have to learn for now.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you talk about
this, too, in the book.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.480 align:middle line:90%
For now, you're learning--

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we do have
expanded free choice

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.569 align:middle line:84%
as a species in
most countries now,

00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:04.610 align:middle line:84%
in terms of who we're
going to marry, where we're

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.193 align:middle line:84%
going to live, what
we're going to do,

00:43:06.193 --> 00:43:08.725 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, we're on a faster
track for learning, right?

00:43:08.725 --> 00:43:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: A definitely
faster track for learning.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so important
to learn about yourself first.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It's key that you know what's
important for you first.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and that's
where divorce actually serves.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Only if it's
managed through knowledge.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: If it's
managed through viciousness

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.660 align:middle line:84%
or managed through the lower
self, you don't learn anything.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in a
higher version of it

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.480 align:middle line:84%
where you have come
in, this person

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.760 align:middle line:84%
that you were hot for each
other and you go into it

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and you mix it up and maybe
spend 20 years together, maybe

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.260 align:middle line:84%
spend five years
together or one,

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.080 align:middle line:84%
that you learn all you
feel that you have been

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.360 align:middle line:84%
able to absorb from
that situation,

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.145 align:middle line:84%
and consciously
choose to end that,

00:43:49.145 --> 00:43:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that is a path to expanding
the growth of your soul

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.850 align:middle line:90%
in a rapid way in a sense.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: I would
suggest it's one path.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:44:00.230 align:middle line:84%
The other path might be to
learn to evolve and grow

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.647 align:middle line:90%
differently together.

00:44:01.647 --> 00:44:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That, too.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Understanding
yourself and understanding

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.930 align:middle line:84%
the values and priorities
of the excitement that make

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.580 align:middle line:90%
that happen in the first place.

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
we're staying the same

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:13.620 align:middle line:90%
as we did when we were a child.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.665 align:middle line:84%
The problem always
there ends up,

00:44:15.665 --> 00:44:18.260 align:middle line:84%
one soul can choose to
progress and the other

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.600 align:middle line:84%
can choose not to,
to refine itself

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.760 align:middle line:90%
and to ask questions and grow.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think the problem often
comes when you don't have

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.815 align:middle line:90%
a mutual growth experience.

00:44:27.815 --> 00:44:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Level of-- yeah.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:84%
However, if you can live
through your values and through

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:39.860 align:middle line:84%
your priorities, and work
through that division,

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:84%
through the strength--
your best self--

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.750 align:middle line:90%
then you emerge whole.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.600 align:middle line:84%
The other person may not,
but you emerge whole.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's the goal.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.870 align:middle line:84%
The goal is not to
depart fractured--

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: --and splintered.

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And so only the
usefulness of having

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.750 align:middle line:84%
that option in
these times, to be

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:03.111 align:middle line:84%
able to learn and learn again,
or learn again if you need to.

00:45:03.111 --> 00:45:04.610 align:middle line:84%
One thing we didn't
talk about but I

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:07.680 align:middle line:84%
want to go back to before
we move on to "You,

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Me, Relationship."

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
when a woman decides

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.950 align:middle line:90%
to terminate her pregnancy?

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.770 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at that
through the lens of the soul,

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.660 align:middle line:84%
because they've already
selected that particular body

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.460 align:middle line:90%
or vehicle.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Right.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.872 align:middle line:84%
The soul and the
mother have a contract.

00:45:24.872 --> 00:45:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Contract is a strong word, but
agreement, an understanding.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And the mother says, you
know, I'm 16 years old.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.145 align:middle line:90%


00:45:34.145 --> 00:45:35.987 align:middle line:90%
I do want you one day--

00:45:35.987 --> 00:45:38.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't say this consciously,
but the soul part of it says,

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:90%
I do want to have you one day.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I can do it right now.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not in the best
interests of you or myself

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:46.740 align:middle line:90%
to do it right now.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:47.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.182 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have to separate.

00:45:49.182 --> 00:45:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So the body leaves.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:51.598 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: The body lets go.

00:45:51.598 --> 00:45:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The body lets go.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.400 align:middle line:84%
But will that same soul
often come back when--

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Sometimes they do.

00:45:56.950 --> 00:46:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I have a colleague who works
with hypnosis for fertility.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And she talks directly to
the soul of the baby that's

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.886 align:middle line:90%
refusing to come in.

00:46:05.886 --> 00:46:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, uh-huh.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.468 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And
sometimes this baby

00:46:08.468 --> 00:46:11.690 align:middle line:84%
will say, I'm not coming
in until you stop working

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and make space for me.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Get a nursery ready.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Make space for me.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm not coming in until
you and my father settle this.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not coming in.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And my colleague will
say to the client, what

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:30.590 align:middle line:90%
is it that needs to be settled?

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, he wants to
move here, or--

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.100 align:middle line:90%
So they have to settle that.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the baby
chooses to come in.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.860 align:middle line:90%
It's magical.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.819 align:middle line:84%
It's extraordinary
work that she does.

00:46:38.819 --> 00:46:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: It is.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the soul will
make other accommodations.

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.791 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It will
make other choices.

00:46:45.791 --> 00:46:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That vehicle is no
longer available,

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:48.890 align:middle line:84%
because the mother can't
take that on right now.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Can't take
that on right now, and--

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
hurt the soul.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: No.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Just go home.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just go
home, make another option,

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.060 align:middle line:90%
or come back later.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: That's right.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's important
for people to understand.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: It's like going
on a bus that breaks down.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:06.180 align:middle line:84%
You get off the bus and you go
home, or you get another bus.

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
rather mechanical,

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:09.370 align:middle line:90%
but I believe that is the case.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yeah.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:12.421 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds a little
cold maybe, and harsh.

00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:13.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not how it's meant.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.760 align:middle line:90%
It's meant for understanding.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again,
if you're dancing

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.054 align:middle line:84%
in the realm of the soul, the
rules are different anyway.

00:47:18.054 --> 00:47:23.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about your newest
book, and the premise for it,

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.590 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Why you wrote this book.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: OK.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Every relationship, you and
I, has an unspoken contract.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.510 align:middle line:90%
It's unsaid.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But we have expectations
of each other.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So whether it be you
and I, or whether it

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:45.410 align:middle line:84%
be the cashier at
the supermarket,

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:51.350 align:middle line:84%
or an in-law, or our
doctor, we have a contract,

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:52.580 align:middle line:90%
and nobody talks about it.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So quite often, we feel let
down, we feel abandoned,

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.140 align:middle line:84%
we feel disappointed,
because we don't know

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.210 align:middle line:90%
what to expect from each other.

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:05.060 align:middle line:90%
But we do have expectations.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.710 align:middle line:84%
We have expectations
of ourselves,

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:08.340 align:middle line:90%
and we also let ourselves down.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And what
happened is many years ago,

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.840 align:middle line:84%
eight years ago
now, I had a client

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.480 align:middle line:84%
who came into the
clinic, and he came in

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.620 align:middle line:84%
because he just inherited
his family's business.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And with the family
business came

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.520 align:middle line:84%
the bookkeeper, who he'd
known since he was four.

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And she loved him, but she
loved him like a four-year-old.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.074 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she didn't
respect him as a man.

00:48:32.074 --> 00:48:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Or a boss.

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or a boss, obviously.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yeah.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So she'd taken a
snapshot of him,

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.090 align:middle line:84%
but he'd also taken
a snapshot of her.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So he found himself
getting really angry.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.114 align:middle line:84%
So when he'd have
a staff meeting

00:48:43.114 --> 00:48:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and he'd suggest something,
she'd tap him on the shoulder,

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.340 align:middle line:90%
say it's OK, dear, we're fine.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGH]

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:50.431 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And he'd go
[EXPLOSION WITH HANDS],, right?

00:48:50.431 --> 00:48:52.580 align:middle line:90%
And then he'd apologize later.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And the following day, she'd
come in with cookies saying,

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry I upset you, dear.

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And he slammed the
desk, and he said,

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:01.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't want her damn cookies!

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that what had
happened, that that moment,

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:08.600 align:middle line:84%
what was that
contract, it clicked.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So from that time on,
I started this process.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And the contract, first
start with yourself,

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:19.400 align:middle line:84%
is made up of your value
system, your priorities.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.440 align:middle line:90%
What do you absolutely need?

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line, four or five
things that you absolutely

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.770 align:middle line:90%
need in every relationship?

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:28.800 align:middle line:90%
And I mean every relationship.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.600 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.470 align:middle line:90%
What's a nice to have?

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And what are you
prepared to give?

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the part
that's often missing--

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.035 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Most
of it's missing.

00:49:36.035 --> 00:49:37.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in today's world.

00:49:37.035 --> 00:49:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yeah.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.941 align:middle line:84%
What are you prepared
to give to keep

00:49:38.941 --> 00:49:41.620 align:middle line:84%
this third circle,
this contract,

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:45.440 align:middle line:90%
juicy, healthy, alive.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is it takes
it away from the you and me,

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and it points it to
the relationship.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So that I'm not doing it to
you, I'm not betraying you,

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not being nasty to you.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm diminishing
the relationship.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And it works brilliantly
with teens and parents.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It works brilliantly
with couples

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.960 align:middle line:84%
who are thinking
about separating,

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.920 align:middle line:84%
because, as I said a little
earlier, if they separate,

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.770 align:middle line:84%
then they separate whole because
they know now who they are,

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and what their needs are,
what their wants are--

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.261 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's healthy.

00:50:18.261 --> 00:50:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: --and what
they're prepared to give.

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.820 align:middle line:84%
The other place it works
really well with people

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:25.550 align:middle line:84%
having trouble with
in-laws, there's

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.020 align:middle line:90%
expectation set up there.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And half the time,
the in-laws have

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:30.170 align:middle line:84%
totally different
expectations of what

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.780 align:middle line:90%
the daughter or son-in-law has.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.060 align:middle line:84%
If the son-in-law at all
has any expectations,

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.072 align:middle line:84%
because quite a lot of the
time, they don't get involved.

00:50:38.072 --> 00:50:39.530 align:middle line:84%
They have to learn
to get involved,

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.300 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
relationship there.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
that third circle is.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's about.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's about learning how
to work with your siblings,

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:50.930 align:middle line:84%
with the unloved
ones in your life,

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:52.100 align:middle line:90%
because we all have those.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, Uncle Charlie always
pinches your bum or whatever.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.100 align:middle line:84%
You hate going to
family meetings,

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and you do this before
you go to family meetings.

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:01.760 align:middle line:90%
How do you manage that?

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.680 align:middle line:84%
How do you live through
that and make it OK?

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.714 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how do
you do that unilaterally?

00:51:05.714 --> 00:51:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: By
living your values.

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.620 align:middle line:84%
By understanding who you
are, and what you are,

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.880 align:middle line:90%
and what's important to you.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does that
necessarily tell you

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:16.230 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the agreement
with you and the other person,

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:17.900 align:middle line:84%
or does it simply
give you the tools

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.090 align:middle line:84%
to manage the current
relationship better?

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: It does both.

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Because as we change, as we come
more comfortable in our skin,

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:26.840 align:middle line:90%
other people change around us.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.610 align:middle line:84%
They don't even realize
they're doing it.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Does it work all the time?

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:30.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:32.697 align:middle line:84%
But it works about
80% of the time.

00:51:32.697 --> 00:51:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some
of these agreements

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.870 align:middle line:90%
may not be from this lifetime.

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: That's totally it.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So if these
agreements that we've

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.500 align:middle line:84%
come in with to be a
victim, for instance, and we

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.320 align:middle line:84%
keep choosing people
who are "losers,"

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.440 align:middle line:84%
then let's look at
what we can do today

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.110 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't have
to come in again,

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:52.730 align:middle line:84%
so we can repair it
in this lifetime.

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if you,
out of self-defense,

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.270 align:middle line:84%
maybe poisoned that person
your last time around together,

00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:59.730 align:middle line:90%
there's going to be a loaded--

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:00.740 align:middle line:90%
And this stuff happens.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Yes,
of course it does.

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is going to
be a loaded relationship.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go back
to the patronizing

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.400 align:middle line:84%
bookkeeper and
the man who is now

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.129 align:middle line:90%
the boss, and that situation.

00:52:10.129 --> 00:52:11.420 align:middle line:90%
How did they work through that?

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.220 align:middle line:90%
What came of it?

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Well, what
happened with him first

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:18.860 align:middle line:84%
is that we worked through
this process with him first.

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And I helped him understand that
he'd taken a snapshot of her,

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.770 align:middle line:90%
as she had of him.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So how is he going to use his
best self and his kindness?

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:35.270 align:middle line:84%
He is a man who believes
so strongly in integrity,

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.370 align:middle line:84%
how is he going to
use that part of him

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to help her bring her
snapshot up to date?

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And I did that with my
sister, because my sister

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and I had snapshots
of each other.

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about this, and
we brought our snapshots up

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:51.800 align:middle line:90%
to date.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.466 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
that's a really good--

00:52:53.466 --> 00:52:55.700 align:middle line:84%
it's a really good
process to go through.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.272 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: It's extraordinary,
simple, but very effective.

00:52:59.272 --> 00:53:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the book
is about the process.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: About the process.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I hand-hold people
through the process.

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So it starts with
you, and then it

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.940 align:middle line:84%
starts with the love in your
life, your current person,

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.530 align:middle line:90%
if you have one.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And your ex has a
whole chapter on how

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.020 align:middle line:84%
to work this process
with your ex.

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are different charts
that you can work through.

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So I hand-hold you through
it so you make growth.

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So your ex, your siblings,
your boss, your employee,

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:37.460 align:middle line:84%
the professionals in your
life, the people you pay.

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And the top line of that is
they are not your friend.

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Your personal trainer
may be friendly,

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:44.460 align:middle line:84%
your hairdresser
may be friendly,

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.800 align:middle line:90%
but they are not your friend.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.872 align:middle line:84%
Because the minute
you stop paying them--

00:53:48.872 --> 00:53:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything changes.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA:
--everything changes.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So the basic premise goes all
the way through the chapters.

00:53:56.310 --> 00:54:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But the interpretation of
it, and the different charts

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.135 align:middle line:84%
that you're given
to work through

00:54:02.135 --> 00:54:03.510 align:middle line:84%
are different with
every chapter.

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:07.860 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if
you have a sibling

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:12.660 align:middle line:84%
that you're no longer talking
to, using your best self,

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.120 align:middle line:84%
you decide you want-- for
the purpose of the children,

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.080 align:middle line:84%
or even for yourself--
you want a relationship

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:17.880 align:middle line:90%
with that person.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.713 align:middle line:84%
It may never be like
this [HANDS TOGETHER],,

00:54:19.713 --> 00:54:22.420 align:middle line:84%
but at least you can
have it like this.

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.610 align:middle line:90%
So this is the chart.

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:25.170 align:middle line:84%
This is what I
would like it to be.

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:27.970 align:middle line:84%
This is what I would like to
feel when I'm with this person.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:28.770 align:middle line:90%
You write it down.

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:31.590 align:middle line:84%
This is what I will like
to do with this person.

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And then so this is what
I'm going to do about it.

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.510 align:middle line:84%
In one month time,
this is the result--

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:37.620 align:middle line:90%
boom, boom, boom.

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Two months' time, six months'
time, and a year's time.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So you're making a
plan to make change,

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking total
responsibility for it

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.620 align:middle line:84%
through your value system
and your priority system.

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so are
people are usually

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:52.920 align:middle line:84%
able to affect the
change they wish,

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.170 align:middle line:84%
even if the other person
is not privy to the process

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:55.971 align:middle line:90%
or anything?

00:54:55.971 --> 00:54:57.136 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: 80% of the time.

00:54:57.136 --> 00:54:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 80%.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.900 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty darn useful work.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: It's
very useful work.

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And I jokingly
say to my clients,

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:06.600 align:middle line:84%
even aspirin only
works 80% of the time.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, and on that
note, I just also

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.600 align:middle line:10%
wanted to bring up that in
the back of the other book,

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.720 align:middle line:10%
the previous book that
we were speaking about,

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:19.622 align:middle line:10%
you have a really beautiful
meditation at the end.

00:55:19.622 --> 00:55:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And you recommend-- and this,
I think, is really important.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.060 align:middle line:84%
For people who write
meditation books,

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.220 align:middle line:84%
it's really important
that, as you said in there,

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.570 align:middle line:84%
you record this for
yourself, or have someone

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:30.810 align:middle line:84%
that has a lovely voice
record it for you,

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:32.716 align:middle line:84%
so that you can go
through the process.

00:55:32.716 --> 00:55:34.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't read yourself
through a meditation.

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Right.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:35.830 align:middle line:90%
You have to trust that person.

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
what kind of feedback

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.600 align:middle line:84%
have you gotten
from this meditation

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.770 align:middle line:90%
at the back of the book?

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: Oh,
things as grand as it

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.220 align:middle line:84%
changed my life, because I
never thought I could meditate

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.360 align:middle line:90%
and now I find I can.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.640 align:middle line:84%
To I got halfway through and
I suddenly brought myself out

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:57.960 align:middle line:84%
of it because I just had a
recognition what I need to do.

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.580 align:middle line:84%
All the way down to, it puts
me to sleep every night,

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.380 align:middle line:90%
is that OK?

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course it's OK.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You're getting it
subconscious anyway.

>>GEORGINA: Of course it's OK.

00:56:05.105 --> 00:56:06.300 align:middle line:90%
It's all OK.

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.910 align:middle line:84%

the beauty of
regression work, and all

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:13.840 align:middle line:84%
the way up through "You,
Me, and Relationship?"

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA: Yes.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:24.060 align:middle line:10%
I am intent on helping people
find their magnificence.

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:25.694 align:middle line:10%
We are so much
more than we seem.

00:56:25.694 --> 00:56:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA: And I
will do anything

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.280 align:middle line:84%
in my powers and
abilities to help

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.580 align:middle line:90%

And you do a
beautiful job of it.
