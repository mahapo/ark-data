00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The UFO community

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:10%
is divided into very
distinct camps, those

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:10%
who are searching for
the conspiracy and those

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:10%
who are looking to unify.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Both have their
value, but those who

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
are looking to unify
receive far less publicity.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Glenn Steckling is the keeper of
a precious archive of materials

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
based on the life and experience
of George Adamski, a gentleman

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:84%
contactee who was
visited by people

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:84%
from Venus and other planets
back in the 1950s and '60s.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've always just
loved this story.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.540 align:middle line:84%
It just appeals to me on
a very intuitive level.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
And before we get into
George Adamski personally,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about why you're
the keeper of the archive

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.862 align:middle line:84%
and how your family came to
be involved with Adamski.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:12.320 align:middle line:10%
>>GLENN STECKLING:
Well, my parents

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:10%
researched UFO sightings already
in Europe during the war.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.817 align:middle line:10%
And when they immigrated to
this plan-- to this country--

00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:10%
I was going to say planet.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.442 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Planet.

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --to
this country, there

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.987 align:middle line:84%
was a large amount
of UFO sightings,

00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:90%
especially out here in Colorado.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
We lived out in Aurora in 1962,
and in '63 in Washington, DC,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
where we had another sighting
over downtown Washington

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:90%
at about 1,500 feet.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
newspaper reporter

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
for the "Washington Daily News"
and about 30 other witnesses

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
that saw this bell-shaped
craft hovering over the city.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And I provided you a copy
of that article as well.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And the next day
that was in the newspaper.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And so my father said,
we've seen enough.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Time to go to the
Library of Congress.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And under the factual center,
A for Adamski, "Flying Saucers

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Have Landed."

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Inside were photographs of
the exact same type of craft

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:90%
we had witnessed.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So he wrote to George, who
was coming to the East Coast

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.561 align:middle line:84%
in about three months' time
to lecture to the Air Force

00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Reserves.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
We met him, became
coworkers and friends

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:90%
and very close associates.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:10%
And we had the privilege
over those years

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:10%
to help arrange media events,
the international press

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:10%
conference in the
Mayflower Hotel,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:10%
NBC studios, and what have you.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And at the time of
George's passing,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:84%
he handed over his briefcase
of materials to my father

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and asked him to
continue the work.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And so since that
time, my father

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:84%
went to NASA, between
22 scientists in '67.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Freeman in the
Pentagon, he was invited to.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Eventually the British
House of Lords,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Lord Clancarty arranged that.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So my parents and our family
were extremely visible

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:90%
and extremely active.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:84%
My father was on "Voice of
America" for many months

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
during that whole 1960s decade,
Art Linkletter show in 1970.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we interacted in
perhaps a different level,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:84%
historically, that
many can claim

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
to have said of these days.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And based upon that
interaction and confidences,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
more and more information and
material became available.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance,
after the panel

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
with the 22 scientists
at NASA Goddard,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
they were sympathetic
individuals

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:84%
who eventually pointed him
in the directions to go,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.980 align:middle line:84%
as the years passed, whereby
he could order the Apollo

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:84%
pictures and the Gemini pictures
and Lunar Orbiter pictures

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For examination.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.968 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: For examination.

00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:38.840 align:middle line:84%
They come in catalogs
or microfiche,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and you have to order
and purchase them,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.967 align:middle line:90%
just like anybody else.

00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you take
those, and you begin

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
to examine them with magnifying
glasses and photographic

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.109 align:middle line:84%
equipment in order to
bring out the material

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that you will see
in his second book,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:90%
"Alien Bases on the Moon."

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we started
and the momentum continued

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:90%
to build.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And then when my father
passed away in '91,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
the mantle of
responsibility fell

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:84%
to me, in which I had a
choice to accept it or not.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.925 align:middle line:90%
And there was no choice at all.

00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, because
you'd been involved

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.898 align:middle line:90%
since you were a child.

00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Since I was
a child, and thoroughly

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
incorporated into
the many activities,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:84%
also some of the contacts
that came to George

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:84%
directly I witnessed and
have witnessed since.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it seemed like
a responsibility that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:90%
couldn't be walked away from.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I've become
probably the greatest recipient

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
in the learning section
of being able to go out

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
amongst the public and tell
them and remind them and help

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
educate them, the
entire emphasis

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
behind George's contacts,
the purposes behind that.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.132 align:middle line:84%
And we see that kind
of missing these days.

00:04:42.132 --> 00:04:42.931 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: A lot of
material is thrown out there.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But other than fear and
aggression and confusion,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
there's very little that
leaves towards any type

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.235 align:middle line:90%
of positive progression.

00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:53.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:53.035 --> 00:04:55.324 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: George is the
exception in that case.

00:04:55.324 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
and that is why

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%
I've been drawn to that work.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, because as
George passed off his briefcase

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
to you, you inherited
the briefcase,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:90%
and you carry it with you today.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.044 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: I carry--

00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A briefcase.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: It isn't
the same old briefcase

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:90%
because it fell apart.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But the contents--

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.965 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Yes,
but the contents--

00:05:11.965 --> 00:05:12.923 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING:
--first-generation photographs.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I have copies of the films that
have been transferred onto DVD.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
That already happened
when I did the transfer

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:84%
for 20th Century Fox for
the remake of "The Day

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:90%
the Earth Stood Still."

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And I was going
to ask you about that,

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:10%
and that's my next question.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.766 align:middle line:84%
So what was "The Day the Earth
Stood Still" patterned after?

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: The
significance of that movie--

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and there is some
truth behind it

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.751 align:middle line:84%
because an event
happened to that prior

00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
to the end of World War II,
except for the landing was

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:84%
in Alaska, and it was attended
by four heads of state.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But the entire emphasis of
"The Day the Earth Stood Still"

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that, congruently
to the observations

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and sightings that have
happened, this craft came,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
landed close to the
White House on the mall--

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and I remember walking
by that mall many times

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s when we lived there.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And the space person came
out, along with the robotic,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:84%
which is common to all
these type of crafts.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:84%
They have either a
robotic or an android.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And it shows
psychologically exactly

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:84%
the type of mentality both
of the people of this world,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
what hasn't changed, the
military, which hasn't changed,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and also our
government officials

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:90%
and how they deal with that.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And so this person goes out
amongst the general public

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and begins to try
to understand how

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:84%
it is that we have this
unconscionable fear

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.585 align:middle line:90%
and irrationality.

00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
famous section

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.240 align:middle line:84%
of that film where he's
standing there with the boy

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:90%
that he is boarding in the room.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.095 align:middle line:84%
And the guy is coming
down, the news reel person

00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
with the microphone,
and he keeps

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:90%
going from person to person.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And when they get
to him and he says,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm concerned when we
substitute unrational behavior

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and fear for logic and
science, and they pull the mic

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:90%
right away.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so
the film is excellent.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And it also shows that
there is a contingency

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
of science-related
academics who are also

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.011 align:middle line:90%
very interested in this field.

00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:11.926 align:middle line:84%
They don't always throw
their names behind it,

00:07:11.926 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and that's not how this works.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk
about that later.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But it also depicts the dangers
that we skirt along the abyss

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
continually on how we treat
the planet, our ability

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
to destroy each other
and the world we live on,

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and the acknowledgement
of that relationship.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So the movie all in all,
George loved the movie.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It depicts very
accurately the type

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
of contacts that have happened
during that era and also since.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me
ask you a question.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
probably out of place,

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.346 align:middle line:84%
but how did he feel about
the story of Valiant Thor

00:07:54.346 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:90%
by Frank Stranges?

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, I can
only tell you the experiences

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:90%
we had.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
George passed away
in April of '65.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:84%
In the fall of '65, there
was a knock at our door.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:84%
My father goes to open the door,
and there stands Valiant Thor.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, tell me.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And my father
says to him, he laughs.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:84%
He says to him, I
know who you are.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.887 align:middle line:84%
You're a misinformation
agent for the government.

00:08:21.887 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your father said that?

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.345 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And Valiant
Thor laughed, and he says,

00:08:25.345 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:90%
you're absolutely correct.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And my
father says, well,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I have been thoroughly briefed
on you and your behaviors

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:90%
and what is going on.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said to them, he said,
you will find no traction here,

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:90%
nor welcome here.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:84%
And so Mr. Thor said
thank you very much.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Have a nice day,
and off he went.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
That is our interaction
with Mr. Thor in 1965.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only definitive
that I can give you,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.940 align:middle line:84%
only that which I have and we
have experienced ourselves.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's responsible.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But, having known of Thor
and the contributions

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.779 align:middle line:84%
with those in power at the
time, right, providing that's

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
part of the story, what was the
nature of the disinformation?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, how was he skewing?

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, first of
all, he was not from Venus.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, the promotion
of the information

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that came downstream
for that is contrary

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:90%
to the actual circumstances.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
common in this field.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.569 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
it's like fishing.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:84%
In order to catch
a good fish, you've

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:90%
got to use a well-baited hook.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So these days, what
happens is they

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
take established, known
events, which there's

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:84%
very little knowledge about,
but we can pretty much securely

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:84%
say this happened, like
Roswell and other things.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And then based upon
that foundation, then

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:84%
the injection of
other information

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.294 align:middle line:84%
in order to take it
into variable tangents--

00:09:52.294 --> 00:09:54.626 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of piggy-backs
off of it like a parasite.

00:09:54.626 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Exactly, well said.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it is a method upon which
to grab those who don't know,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and even better those who think
they know a portion of it,

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.226 align:middle line:90%
and then run with it.

00:10:07.226 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Because unless you
have that foundation

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:84%
in the truth of
the actual event,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
you will accept everything
that happens downstream.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And this is
where we're getting ourselves

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
in a great deal of
trouble in this field.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
couldn't agree more.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So, no, going back to
Adamski, again, as I call him

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
a gentleman contactee, and
that has a lot of connotations.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It means there is a type of
academic vigor, a morality

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:90%
and ethics that he stood for.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about that in a minute.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
else, of course,

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
that strikes me and has always
struck me in this conversation.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is he had some unique
physical features, if I recall.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And we might just
bring up one or two

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:84%
of the most obvious ones,
because my question follows

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, we put
a great deal of emphasis

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:84%
on the external and very
little on the internal.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:06.740 align:middle line:84%
He had a particular
symbol on his form

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that passed away
when he passed away.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But as far as being any
different biologically

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.500 align:middle line:90%
than you and I, he was not.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And neither are these beings
that come from other worlds.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:90%
They are exactly like you and I.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the chemical
scientists and the biologists

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and listen to what
they say, we find

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that the commonality of
creation comes from the elements

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:90%
from space.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And all that is seeded on this
planet, about two tons a day,

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
compromise the organic
materials that eventually

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:90%
bring about life as we know it.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:84%
We trail this material
behind our planet.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:90%
So do all the other planets.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:90%
We intermix.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get a
meteorite from Mars

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica and
so on and so forth.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So we are basically a very large
oven with many different pies,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:84%
all made of the same
material, and over time

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:90%
evolving in the same method.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But as far as George
was concerned,

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
this particular symbol basically
stood for the evolution

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:90%
of his particular character.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered,
because he speaks of the fact

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that there are others like
the ones that contacted him

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:90%
that are among us.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.865 align:middle line:84%
I mean, arguably
we are them, but--

00:12:27.865 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Correct.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --beyond
that, that there

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
are many who have actually
come from other places

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:84%
with intentions to help move
along, whether it's philosophy,

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's science,
or whether it's healing,

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that are seeded among us, and
you can't tell the difference

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
because, as I just did an
interview just before you,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.766 align:middle line:84%
a contactee's experience is most
of these beings are humanoid.

00:12:49.766 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Correct.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they look
just like us, right?

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I've always
wondered, is George one

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.690 align:middle line:90%
of them who is seeded here?

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Was George?

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.975 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: No, he was
born on this planet.

00:12:59.975 --> 00:13:00.774 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:00.774 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: But as far as
his interaction and contact,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:84%
you could say that's
the next best thing.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:84%
He basically was one of
them in likeness of thought

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and in understanding, in
absorption of the facts,

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and as a vehicle to transmit
what this planet needs.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, now this gets into
another nuance on that.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
It's been explained to me by
a couple of different people,

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
their understanding of
the track of progression

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate on Earth for
beings who have come to help,

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.630 align:middle line:84%
It starts in one star system
and gains density as it goes on.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Pleiades is often hit, and then
it ultimately ends up at Venus

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.640 align:middle line:90%
before incarnating on Earth.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's a trajectory
two independent people

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.210 align:middle line:90%
talked about.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So if that's true, I guess
my question is really more,

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.760 align:middle line:84%
is he one of those people
that has gravitated

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
from that Venusian path
to Earth for the express

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle line:84%
purpose of helping in bringing
higher knowledge to us,

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and thus allowing him to have
these constant relationships

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:90%
with these other people?

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Because he's maybe
of that tribe.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, let's be
clear on a couple things.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there is a race
of humanoids that travel space.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And they, as part of their
purpose, colonize worlds.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And they do
that throughout the cosmos.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:84%
We have remnants
of that symbology

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
of those people,
which are called the

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
[? tritarians, ?] which
is symbolized by half man,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:90%
half fish.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course if you look now
at the symbology of Poseidon

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and Neptune, this is
leftover from that earlier

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:90%
representation.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the human
genome is seeded

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and evolves throughout
the cosmos in commonality.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Now as far as the
reincarnation aspect,

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:84%
we all have multiple
lives in the past.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:84%
We've had to, because over the
period of millions of years,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:84%
nature allows us the
progression of learning what

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:84%
needs to be used towards
our further evolvement

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:84%
as a character and
of those around us.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
That cannot be construed
in a single lifetime.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
most of the religions,

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:90%
they do teach reincarnation.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I have a very good
book written by theologians

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
that said why Jesus
taught reincarnation, not

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:90%
resurrection.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: The church
changed that term.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
so when he stood

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:84%
on the mountain
of transfiguration

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and became all
these other faces,

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
he was showing to his
disciples who he had been.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And for anyone else
who you've been

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:84%
in the past, since we'd
like to glorify ourselves,

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:90%
is irrelevant.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:90%
We have been good.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:90%
We have been bad--

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.079 align:middle line:90%
the good, bad, the ugly.

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
process of learning.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: It's
a process, right?

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And who you may or
may not have been

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:84%
is for your self-realization,
not for others.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Because we are each in
a stage of development--

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --that
allows us that recognition

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to us.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
That brings into
mind what I've heard

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.390 align:middle line:84%
often times being promoted
in this field as this force

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.840 align:middle line:84%
of benevolence, this age of
whatever you want to call it,

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Aquarius
or this or that,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and upon which this
force will insert itself

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
among the planets or this planet
in order to raise everybody

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:90%
to the same level.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not going
to happen that way.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.461 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Not going
to happen because it

00:16:39.461 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:84%
shows a basic misunderstanding
of how natural principle works.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Because each
person has a different level

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:46.775 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:16:46.775 --> 00:16:47.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:47.575 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: You do not drag
a teenager into university

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:84%
or a first grader
into university

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and expect them to be able
to sustain themselves.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.485 align:middle line:90%
So what this means--

00:16:58.485 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
the space people

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:90%
have come to help us realize--

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:84%
is that anything and
everything requires

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:84%
our own individual attention,
responsibility, and action.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
Just like John
Kennedy said, we have

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.314 align:middle line:84%
progressed to a state
over a period of time.

00:17:19.314 --> 00:17:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you reverse
that, it will still

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
take a period of
time, hopefully,

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:84%
if it's unabridged, in order
to return to that state.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have to take
responsibility for ourselves.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.272 align:middle line:90%
Do we get a helping hand?

00:17:30.272 --> 00:17:31.071 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, yeah.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: But we
have to make the choice,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately
these days, we have

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:90%
chosen the other direction.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and at the time,

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
the messages that were coming
to Adamski were very life

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:90%
affirming--

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --on every level.

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is useful to us
today, especially considering

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.050 align:middle line:84%
what became injected into
the whole UFO scene starting

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s and '90s, which
was almost exclusively fear.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Yes, to
make it simply put.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
in the re-release

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:84%
of "Behind the Flying
Saucer" mystery,

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
we originally developed a
dogma during the '40s and '50s.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
We were going to deny these
crafts exist, no matter

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:90%
who said so.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.310 align:middle line:84%
We were going to deny their
existence, their capabilities,

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that
they come amongst us.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
When that could no
longer be sustained,

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and we started going
out into space,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
our space program,
even though there

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
were many who were
discontent with that agenda

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and spoke openly
against it, had to be

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
congruent to that
original thought.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.825 align:middle line:84%
You cannot say something doesn't
exist and then go into space

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh boy, that does.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Because
somebody's going

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
to start pointing
a finger and said,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:84%
oh boy, liar, liar,
pants on fire, right?

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:56.890 align:middle line:10%
And so officially we
developed a separate agenda

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:10%
to say, OK, when we
go out into space,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:10%
we will make the conditions very
hostile, unsustainable to life,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.920 align:middle line:10%
and so on and so forth.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
But, as you can see, if
enough research is done,

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:84%
you can find holes in
all of those reports

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:84%
to show atmosphere on the
Moon, water, the same on Mars,

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
conditions better on Venus.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Because as we go along
in time, ever so slowly,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.590 align:middle line:84%
a sliver of information
is left to us.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And for most people
who don't pay attention

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
or don't follow a thought
from point A to point B,

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.220 align:middle line:90%
it just goes by.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you start to collect
it over a period of time,

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:84%
like we have done at
the Adamski Foundation,

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and you make it
available to the public,

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.895 align:middle line:84%
you can start to paint
a much broader picture.

00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yes, in
this book, "The Mystery

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:84%
of the Flying Saucers"
part-- is it two or three?

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Two.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Two, one of the
things I love about the book is,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:84%
besides speaking
about Adamski himself,

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:84%
is the science that
he was bringing

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.880 align:middle line:90%
from these other people to us.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into that in a moment.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
the book impresses

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and that I had been
impressed with before is he

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:84%
was very rigorous in
looking for people

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
to try to invalidate
what he had been told,

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:90%
his findings, his evidence.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Now he fell to the misfortune
of some shenanigans

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
where photos would
simply disappear.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Evidence would simply disappear,
and that kind of thing,

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:90%
which was unfair.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But he actually
challenged people

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.217 align:middle line:90%
to disprove his findings.

00:20:24.217 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That's right.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.091 align:middle line:84%
He offered several
thousand dollars' reward

00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:31.137 align:middle line:84%
to anybody who could disprove or
show fakery of the photographs.

00:20:31.137 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And as we've shown in
the book, and as we've

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:84%
discussed before when we did our
original interview many years

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:84%
ago, is that the
volume of evidence

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
has always stood up behind the
examination of George's photos,

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.465 align:middle line:84%
and the films in which I
will give you a copy of.

00:20:46.465 --> 00:20:47.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And that is what
irks his critics the greatest.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They will try anything
and everything

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
to try to discredit those
photographs, but none of them

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:90%
are experts.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And yet experts
have come forward

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:84%
to show that they are optically
correct of the type of crafts

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.280 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.677 align:middle line:84%
None of them can do anything but
shoot off opinions or replicate

00:21:08.677 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:84%
opinions that others
have said, so you

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
get second and third and
fourth-hand domino effect.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:10%
And I have openly challenged
these people many times.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:10%
OK, let's sit down, and
let's hash out the facts.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want to do that.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so, to put it
quite clear, George Adamski is,

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to a great degree,
especially within this field,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:90%
highly ignored--

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: --and on purpose.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Of all the people,
and I can name dozens over

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.240 align:middle line:84%
the last five decades who have
come and gone in this field,

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.852 align:middle line:84%
nobody receives the negative
attention that George does--

00:21:47.852 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
interesting, because--

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.726 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: --consistently.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to me, he is
one of the most credible

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:90%
of them all.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.534 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Because
he did two things.

00:21:55.534 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:84%
He, one, he talked about human
beings coming to visit us,

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.176 align:middle line:90%
and we don't want to hear that.

00:22:00.176 --> 00:22:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Already since the
'50s, we have pushed,

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:84%
both from the media standpoint
and the movie standpoint

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and across the fields
this idea that everything

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:84%
has to be monstrous, bizarre,
attacking, aggressive.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:10%
Like Reagan said,
amazing how quickly

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.291 align:middle line:10%
we would unify if an aggressive
force came from space.

00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:20.706 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
especially if they

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:84%
look like praying
mantises or ant people

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
worse than that,

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
you can remember a
television program called "V"

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
where they looked
like you and I,

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and then in private they
pulled off the mask--

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --and
were reptilian,

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.455 align:middle line:84%
because we always go back
to that, because it sells.

00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, it sells.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.912 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And that's
basically what this is.

00:22:34.912 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing to do
with educating the public.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with being
responsible for what you show.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It sells and makes some people
very rich in order to do that.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And so in George's case, he
stuck to that, human beings,

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and he stuck to life
in this solar system.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
While he made the statement, I
could have had my life so much

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:84%
easier if I just twisted
it a little bit and said,

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
these visitations come
from another solar system.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:90%
We had no way of verifying that.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.482 align:middle line:84%
It was conveniently
too far away.

00:23:01.482 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, but that
wasn't the truth.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.544 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And the truth
is where they come from.

00:23:05.544 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And he stood by all
means by the truth.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And his story never wavered,
was never embellished, and never

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was well recognized
because of that.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was, and he
did not profit from it.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Not at all.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was not
a profiteer at all.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And again, he offered
open challenge,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.932 align:middle line:84%
and when a few thousand to
several thousand dollars

00:23:22.932 --> 00:23:24.265 align:middle line:90%
was a lot of money in that day--

00:23:24.265 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: In 1950s.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of money,
yeah, that was a year's salary

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.500 align:middle line:90%
for people--

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Oh, absolutely.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.098 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in the day.

00:23:30.098 --> 00:23:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
he gave the rights

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:84%
to publish his materials and
books freely across the world,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:84%
without royalties
or any contracts.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.810 align:middle line:84%
He gave his pictures openly
to whoever came to visit him.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And so if anybody claims that
George profited about it,

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.480 align:middle line:90%
he died.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:10%
He owned no house, no car,
no property, no estate,

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.640 align:middle line:10%
a couple suits to his name.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.160 align:middle line:10%
And if you look in the
San Diego County registry,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:10%
I think the entire estate
was worth just a couple

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:10%
thousand dollars.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: George
was not in this field.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And he certainly could
have made lots of money.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.810 align:middle line:84%
He was offered
millions to shut up.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:90%
So was my father.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.770 align:middle line:84%
My father was offered a million
dollars by the intelligence

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:84%
community if he would
denounce George Adamski.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.470 align:middle line:10%
And my father told them
to kiss his behind.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.686 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for your dad.

00:24:14.686 --> 00:24:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, in the
day, however, Adamski

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:22.110 align:middle line:84%
had access to positions
in very high places.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading one part
of the book in which it

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:84%
says he had access to
an underground passage

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:27.990 align:middle line:90%
to the White House.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: What
happened is George

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:84%
briefed two presidents,
Dwight Eisenhower--

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and took him to an air base out
in the California desert, where

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.620 align:middle line:90%
one of these craft came down.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And they interacted,
did not go for a ride,

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:90%
just interacted on the apron--

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and also John Kennedy
at a different place.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And George used to carry
a White House access

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
pass in his wallet.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.336 align:middle line:90%
And we witnessed that.

00:24:51.336 --> 00:24:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
entrances to the White House.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Of course if you come
through the main entrance,

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
everybody is standing
there taking pictures,

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.858 align:middle line:84%
and you're logged into
a particular book,

00:24:58.858 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But all of the
important stuff comes

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:84%
through the underground
accesses that

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:84%
are leading into the White House
through the military secure

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:90%
zones.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And he had an access
to that, and he used it

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.290 align:middle line:84%
on several occasions when
he was summoned there.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So George was interested in
providing factual substance.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:84%
We were living in
a time at the end

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of an era that broadcast nuclear
destruction, the eliminator

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:90%
of life on this planet.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
He felt that it was
vitally necessary

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that these officials
who made the decisions

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:84%
made the decisions based on
accurate statements and facts

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:90%
and not hearsay and opinions.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he went for.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.876 align:middle line:84%
He didn't care about
his name, meant nothing.

00:25:48.876 --> 00:25:51.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's get into
some of the people he met with.

00:25:51.375 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And let's start with
those from Venus

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and the way they
described their life,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.286 align:middle line:84%
which seems to be a more
ideal version of Earth life

00:26:00.286 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:84%
because they seem to
have worked through some

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.350 align:middle line:84%
of the issues of
aggression and such--

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:84%
longer lifespans,
healthier bodies, right?

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Generally attractive people--

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yes, yes.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --more companionable
social structures.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.948 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: All which
is available to us here.

00:26:14.948 --> 00:26:17.475 align:middle line:84%
We just choose not
to partake of it.

00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
When George made the
statement that you

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:84%
are capable of
living in your body

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:90%
for several hundred years--

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:84%
300, 400 years-- everybody
scoffed at the idea.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Yet recently geneticists
came out and said,

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you're capable of living
in this form at least 200,

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:84%
300 years, if you would
treat it correctly.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Right, and
so we have the ability

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:84%
to participate in
this betterment.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
In their particular
civilization--

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and by no means are they the
only civilization in this solar

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:90%
system--

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
they have worked past the
point of being fractionalized

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:90%
and divided.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:84%
We work consistently
here to divide people

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:84%
into race, into gender,
into state of thought,

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:84%
into religious thinking,
and so on and so forth.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the method upon
which we control the masses.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:84%
There they have
worked past that state

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and realize that when
you work together,

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.320 align:middle line:84%
you get far further
along the line.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Because now you work together
towards a common standard

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:84%
of living, towards a common
value and a common progression.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And you don't waste
so much of your time

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out
what your talents are,

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to get an
education, trying

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to get a job that you
really didn't want to do,

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:84%
50 years of working for the
government and paying taxes.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we lead very
unfulfilled lives here.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And in their society,
they don't do that.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.347 align:middle line:90%
And the whole issue to this is--

00:27:45.347 --> 00:27:46.680 align:middle line:90%
and I've been asked this before.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.140 align:middle line:84%
I had a conversation
yesterday evening, in fact--

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is that George made a
statement, and so did one

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:90%
of the space people whom I met.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, for most of you
who come to our world,

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:84%
you would be highly
uncomfortable.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And I asked, in what manner?

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, not because
of the environment.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, because it's
a state of thinking.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:90%
We work together.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are
open to everyone.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.370 align:middle line:90%
There are no secrets.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:90%
There's no belittlement.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So basically, to
put it simple, let

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:84%
us say this is an island of this
type of behavior and activity.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't even get to
the shores until you're

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.750 align:middle line:84%
developed and willing to
participate collectively

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.295 align:middle line:90%
into that type of advancement.

00:28:26.295 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To be
transparent, even, yes.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: To that.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And so they do not have
individuals who are,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.670 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, malfeasance,
or we don't want to do this,

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:84%
or we want to do it our
way, and so on and so forth.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't even get there until
you've worked out those issues

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:90%
beforehand.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:10%
So when you go to this
place or visit this place,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:10%
you find that you
become integrated

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:10%
into that betterment.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And imagine the
discontinuity it must

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.570 align:middle line:84%
be to experience
that, as George did,

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and by far he was not the only
one to experience that and then

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:84%
have to come back here and
deal with the reality, not

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:84%
the mysticism and all
the sensationalism

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and all the things that have
been injected into this field.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The-- well, that's
a different story.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.894 align:middle line:84%
But when you come
back and you have

00:29:18.894 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:84%
to face the reality of how
things are in this world,

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and you see how it could be, and
that distance between the two

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.730 align:middle line:84%
is not easy to deal with,
George worked like crazy

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to try to reconcile that
understanding with himself

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and also to participate in
both places progressively.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, when the
space people make contact,

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:90%
they vet you very carefully.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.798 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: This is not some
haphazard thing that's thrown

00:29:50.798 --> 00:29:54.630 align:middle line:84%
out there, because it can change
your life so dramatically that

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:84%
if you cannot deal with it,
you no longer can function

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:84%
in your own society
and own world,

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.739 align:middle line:84%
so it becomes a
counterproductive experience

00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:90%
rather than a productive.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So they watch and record, and
they evaluate us very closely.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And George went through
that his entire life.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
proved himself to be

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:15.240 align:middle line:84%
an ethical and a magnanimous,
caring individual.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.808 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
of course he would

00:30:17.808 --> 00:30:19.264 align:middle line:90%
be one that would be selected.

00:30:19.264 --> 00:30:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the other things that
was told to him along the way--

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:90%
just to insert this.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.690 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot to go over here--

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.250 align:middle line:84%
is that they said,
if you're waiting

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.590 align:middle line:84%
for someone to come
save you, it isn't

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.760 align:middle line:90%
going to happen like that.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:84%
This is one person, one choice,
one uplifted thought at a time

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.860 align:middle line:84%
until we reach that level where
we can function in that way.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.118 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Jesus
said each person

00:30:41.118 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:90%
must carry their own burden.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And so now I wanted to ask
something because people

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:90%
slave away on this planet.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Oh yes.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You slave
to pay your taxes,

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.120 align:middle line:84%
slave to pay your
rent, your mortgage.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:84%
How did the, if you can
even call it an economy,

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
work among the Venusians
so they could have

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:90%
what they needed and wanted?

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Some people wanted
more and needed more

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
or felt they wanted more or
desired more than others.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Others chose to
live very simply.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like there was a
complexity of the way in which

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:90%
people live lifestyle-wise.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't read
anything in there

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.720 align:middle line:84%
about this struggle
to make a dollar--

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Not at all.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --or whatever
a Venusian buck would be.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.369 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Because they
don't work on a capitalistic

00:31:20.369 --> 00:31:22.150 align:middle line:90%
or in a competitive system.

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And we've had
societies in the past,

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:25.212 align:middle line:90%
which we could call communal.

00:31:25.212 --> 00:31:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course we always wag
a finger at them and say,

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:28.830 align:middle line:90%
you communist, you.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.920 align:middle line:10%
But it's interesting,
if you go to Israel,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.380 align:middle line:10%
you have the same system
on the kibbutz, where

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:10%
everybody partakes of labor
to put together products

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.542 align:middle line:10%
that all can use
at the same time.

00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:40.500 align:middle line:84%
The Native American
Indians, some of the tribes

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:90%
did the same thing.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's very simple.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:48.000 align:middle line:84%
If the best of
everything is produced,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:84%
then why do you
need something else?

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:84%
See, when we go to Sears
to buy a refrigerator,

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.820 align:middle line:84%
you've got the $300 refrigerator
and a $3,000 refrigerator

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:90%
and everything in between.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But if the best refrigerator
was only produced

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and was there for everybody
because income was not

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.600 align:middle line:84%
an issue, then you got
the very best product.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:90%
You don't need anything else.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.230 align:middle line:84%
You have the very best
mode of transportation--

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.740 align:middle line:90%
let's call it a car--

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.540 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And so when a society
produces things

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.500 align:middle line:84%
based upon their
capabilities and not based

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.050 align:middle line:84%
upon who can afford
what, then you

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:84%
get an entirely
different structure,

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
because you are not finding
this ostracization of people.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So many people who
can't have, and only can

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.590 align:middle line:84%
dream and see advertisings of
what they would like to have,

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.130 align:middle line:90%
of what the few can have.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't exist.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.070 align:middle line:90%
They've moved past that point.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And the secondary
portion of that

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
is, they have gotten to
the point where they learn

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and understood themselves
well enough to understand

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:90%
that it's not my will be done.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:84%
They learned that there is a
greater purpose to existence,

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and not what I want and what
I can do and I can have.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:84%
That stage of
development is down here.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And let me be very clear.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.060 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is merely
a stepping stone,

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.490 align:middle line:84%
one of the classes in
the ladder of learning.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Others are much
lower because you

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.150 align:middle line:84%
have to be able to get here,
as you are able to keep going.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So there are other
representations

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.400 align:middle line:84%
of the many facets
of the human mind

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and its expression spread
out throughout the cosmos.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this, the need
for competition and striving,

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.589 align:middle line:90%
that ache of striving, is gone.

00:33:23.589 --> 00:33:24.755 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That's correct.

00:33:24.755 --> 00:33:26.796 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's been
surpassed with consciousness.

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Mm-hmm.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The areas I found
particularly interesting

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:34.320 align:middle line:84%
in this was-- and this
leads to another question.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.335 align:middle line:84%
You talked about
NASA and NASA having

00:33:36.335 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:84%
to be consistent with the
agenda of the day, which was

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.040 align:middle line:90%
to have to deny the experience.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
there certainly is evidence.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Gaia is running a series
called "Deep Space"--

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that there was another
alternative space program that

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.180 align:middle line:84%
was going on, and that
was exploring and was

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:84%
learning and finding and
bringing back data, as

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.310 align:middle line:90%
were the Russians.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.519 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so in
this day, the Russians

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:84%
are uniquely involved along
with America in this story.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But this brings us to
the question of people

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.100 align:middle line:90%
saying, well, that's impossible.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.679 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the pictures of Venus
and Mars and Jupiter and so on.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.050 align:middle line:90%
There's no way life could exist.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they said that
the surface of that planet

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.390 align:middle line:90%
is 1,800 degrees.

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:18.023 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Mm-hmm.

00:34:18.023 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's
talk about that,

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:84%
because he brings
up, again, in such

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:84%
a direct and gentlemanly
manner that data can not only

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.580 align:middle line:90%
be skewed.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.469 align:middle line:90%
It can be repressed as well.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:84%
And you can take
a pocket of data

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.550 align:middle line:84%
and try to apply it to the
whole, and it doesn't work.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And in that way,
let's talk about what

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.951 align:middle line:84%
they found about the Earth
with the space probes,

00:34:40.951 --> 00:34:42.659 align:middle line:84%
because this, to me,
kind of says it all.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:44.784 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Initially,
when we launched our probes

00:34:44.784 --> 00:34:47.400 align:middle line:84%
into space and this
educational program,

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.940 align:middle line:84%
this scientific
program, which was

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.659 align:middle line:84%
very vital to our own
recognition of our planet

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:55.469 align:middle line:84%
and our existence, it came
back that we bounced the beams

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:58.500 align:middle line:84%
off the ionosphere and that
the temperature was anywhere

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.110 align:middle line:90%
from 1,000 to 1,800 degrees.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was in
early space probes.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.480 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at a little
something more sophisticated.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.070 align:middle line:84%
In 2006, down in the Atacama
Desert, which is in Chile,

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:14.190 align:middle line:84%
the instrumentations from
Viking were replicated,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and also from the upcoming
probes that were going to Mars.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And when those instruments were
set up and the data recorded,

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:84%
the data said
there's no life here.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
is we have data.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.920 align:middle line:84%
How that data is broadcast and
how that data is interpreted

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.660 align:middle line:84%
is based upon who gets what and
when and where and how, right?

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So we look at, for
instance, Venus.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.720 align:middle line:84%
We go and we say it's
450 degrees Celsius,

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:84%
that the temperature is six
times denser than boiling oil,

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:84%
that the winds are
over 400 miles an hour.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get
this information.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.060 align:middle line:84%
We drop probes in by
parachute, which is amazing.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Think about the physics.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.800 align:middle line:84%
How do you go through
six times denser

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.620 align:middle line:84%
than boiling oil at
400 miles an hour

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:90%
and land a parachute probe?

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Then we sent back radar
images-- never photos,

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:07.510 align:middle line:84%
but radar images-- of
jagged mountain ranges.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.111 align:middle line:10%
Under those conditions,
the sandblasting

00:36:10.111 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:10%
of the surface of that planet
would be smooth like a marble.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: You
wouldn't have that.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Next, there is a
very nice picture

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:90%
of Venus from the Mariner.

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a fly by, and
it shows a planet

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.580 align:middle line:84%
with blue, white clouds
swirling around it,

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.590 align:middle line:84%
entirely different
from the photos

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:90%
that you see given to you now.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:35.020 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: And so,
as I said in the book,

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.470 align:middle line:10%
we cannot call everyone who is
involved with JPL and in these

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.280 align:middle line:10%
many different
facilities complicit.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.124 align:middle line:84%
They are simply
technicians and--

00:36:43.124 --> 00:36:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For the most part.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --and
for the most part,

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.349 align:middle line:84%
they sit there and look what
comes over their computer

00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and teleprompters
and what have you.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the best
thing to think about

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:84%
is how are the
instruments calibrated?

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.199 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:58.199 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: As a pilot, I
know my instruments are only

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.110 align:middle line:84%
as good as the
calibration of them,

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.790 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
altimeter, whether it's

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:84%
the air speed and all
of the other ones.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:10%
So if you put in a calibration
error before launch,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.220 align:middle line:10%
and you're the only
one who knows--

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: A calibration error
before launch, intentionally.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Intentional,
and then you launch,

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.900 align:middle line:84%
all the material then
is broadcast down.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the normal
people see this material

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, this
must be verbatim.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:90%
This is how it is.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:84%
But only you know that you
have to readjust that data

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.800 align:middle line:90%
by the pre-calibration.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Go down to
the real baseline.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.826 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That's correct.

00:37:32.826 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's how simple it is.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.712 align:middle line:90%
Volkswagen just proved it.

00:37:35.712 --> 00:37:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: 40% of their
cars falsified emissions.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.404 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:41.404 --> 00:37:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And they had
to pay, what, $15 billion?

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
was a lot of money.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: That's
just the beginning.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Because of calibration
manipulation,

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and it shows you
how easy it's done.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is what
Adamski suggested was going on.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And the information, it was
reflected back to the public,

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that it had been
intentionally miscalibrated so

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:03.920 align:middle line:84%
that the people gathering
the data, the few at the top,

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.117 align:middle line:84%
know what the data
actually means.

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Mm-hmm.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
know more likely

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.660 align:middle line:84%
what the truth is of
the potential for life

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:11.916 align:middle line:90%
on Venus and other planets.

00:38:11.916 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I can
tell you that George

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.500 align:middle line:84%
was given a specially
designed camera, movie picture

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.890 align:middle line:84%
camera, that was lead-lined
in order to protect it

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:90%
from radiation and other rays.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And he took that camera
with him onboard the ships,

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.690 align:middle line:90%
as he was assigned to.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And he filmed not only
onboard the ships,

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.982 align:middle line:84%
but he filmed on the planet
in which he went and landed.

00:38:32.982 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which planet?

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And that
material was given back

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:41.140 align:middle line:84%
to the government, and they
have it under safekeeping.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it really doesn't
make a difference

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Mars, Venus,
Saturn, what have you.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:51.160 align:middle line:84%
But it shows that they are
aware that he was going there.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:84%
They collaborated with him
to supply the material.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:58.510 align:middle line:84%
His space contact agreed
to this procedure.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And so back comes
the information.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.830 align:middle line:10%
So there's a huge amount
of secretive information

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.740 align:middle line:10%
that is warehoused.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And if you ask at what point
will that ever become public,

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to have to be
honest and say never.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:10%
There will never come a
point of full disclosure.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.470 align:middle line:10%
That's a fantasy.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it has taken so
long to corrupt this subject

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that if the government would
suddenly come to you and say,

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.750 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.300 align:middle line:90%
All that was bogus.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to open it all up,
and you get to see what it is.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.410 align:middle line:84%
There will be such a disarray,
such a howling in the UFO

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:42.460 align:middle line:84%
community who have promoted
other information, that they

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.190 align:middle line:84%
will immediately claim you
can't trust the government.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:84%
They're giving you more bogus
information because they cannot

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:84%
reconcile the difference
between what they have promoted

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and marketed and exploited
and what actually comes out

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.360 align:middle line:90%
as the truth in fact.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So we have locked ourselves
in this endless loop,

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
difficult to break out.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.310 align:middle line:84%
If we're looking for
official release,

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.990 align:middle line:84%
George made a statement, and
so did Eisenhower and others,

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that we will only open up
a certain amount of this

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:15.670 align:middle line:84%
officially if we can relate
it to aggressive nature,

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:16.810 align:middle line:90%
to war-like nature.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Because then we can use the
same industries we do now.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Because basically,
the production of weapons

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.840 align:middle line:84%
has become the driver
of our economy.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.540 align:middle line:84%
At 38%, we are the
largest exporters

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.050 align:middle line:90%
of weapons to the world.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: How can
you promote peace

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.036 align:middle line:84%
when you're giving everybody
else guns and thinking,

00:40:37.036 --> 00:40:38.580 align:middle line:84%
well, we don't want
you to use them.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Of course they're
going to use them,

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:40.990 align:middle line:90%
and we know they will use them.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So we have established
a type of thinking

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and a type of economy that is
based upon aggressive activity.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.830 align:middle line:90%
And that will be our undoing.

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And only way that
we will move away

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:84%
from that and that
fractionalization

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.610 align:middle line:84%
is if we have an
outside source that we

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.770 align:middle line:90%
deem as more threatening.

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden we
can use the same method,

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:08.440 align:middle line:84%
not change it, and use it now
to build weapons to fight them.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But we are working
diligently to keep

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:90%
the status quo on this world.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is not
only our own people,

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:24.100 align:middle line:84%
but it also is based upon the
influences and suggestions

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:28.500 align:middle line:84%
of some non-so benevolent
space people as well.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Agreed.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:34.914 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: We have
allowed ourselves to become,

00:41:34.914 --> 00:41:39.810 align:middle line:84%
to a basic word, hypnotized
with sensationalism.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And we
have embraced it.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And it is used against us
psychologically in order

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:51.350 align:middle line:84%
to keep any constructive
change from happening.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And this is where
the UFO movement has gone.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.920 align:middle line:84%
This is where our
politics have gone.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:05.740 align:middle line:84%
This is so many aspects of
the changes on this world.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.370 align:middle line:84%
John Kennedy once said,
the barrage upon the truth

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.160 align:middle line:90%
will become more constant.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And that barrage, that
substitution of truth,

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.710 align:middle line:84%
will become so accepted
that people will not

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:24.725 align:middle line:84%
be able to delineate any longer
between what is substituted

00:42:24.725 --> 00:42:25.525 align:middle line:90%
and what is truth.

00:42:25.525 --> 00:42:26.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:26.325 --> 00:42:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And at the
end, we become slaves

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.560 align:middle line:90%
to the misinformation.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.850 align:middle line:84%
That's more or
less a paraphrase.

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:35.470 align:middle line:90%
And how prophetic is that?

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is very--

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:41.320 align:middle line:84%
60 years later, it couldn't
be more, 60-some years later.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, before we go on to some
of the other technologies

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and scientific realities
that Adamski shared,

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.630 align:middle line:84%
the film you were
talking about, did

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.565 align:middle line:90%
it show habitable conditions?

00:42:52.565 --> 00:42:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Oh, the film that
had to do with the special

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:55.330 align:middle line:90%
camera--

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --that
was developed for him?

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it did, of course.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It showed him, there was a
portion of the film standing

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.644 align:middle line:84%
here on the edge of the plateau
with one of his contacts

00:43:02.644 --> 00:43:04.810 align:middle line:84%
overlooking the mountain
range, and there was a city

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:90%
in the valley down there.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I have to emphasize
the fact that when George went

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.520 align:middle line:84%
into space, perhaps not
to the other planets,

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.810 align:middle line:84%
but at least into space,
into orbit around this planet

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and to the Moon, he
described that he always

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:21.040 align:middle line:84%
recognized other
prominent figures on board

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.510 align:middle line:90%
those crafts as well.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:25.620 align:middle line:84%
People who had come from
government or what have you

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.640 align:middle line:90%
were also invited.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was to
help educate them

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and to push the
experience of what was out

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.200 align:middle line:84%
there so that once
again we would

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.990 align:middle line:84%
get a certain level
of recognition

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:43.420 align:middle line:84%
into what was
happening out in space.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.430 align:middle line:90%
And the interesting thing was--

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and I saw this recently promoted
on the internet as well--

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:53.080 align:middle line:84%
is that the FBI at one point
wanted to persecute George.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And Hoover, who had a thing
for all kinds of different,

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.844 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, of
his intolerances,

00:43:59.844 --> 00:44:01.135 align:middle line:90%
was going to come after George.

00:44:01.135 --> 00:44:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And certain files were printed.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.830 align:middle line:84%
However, the CIA file
that has recently

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:07.720 align:middle line:84%
been released
completely countermands

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.670 align:middle line:90%
whatever was in the FBI file.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, George
said to them, he said, OK.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Call me to testify.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.417 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you where I was
picked up, when, who else--

00:44:17.417 --> 00:44:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who else was on board.

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:20.375 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --was
on the ship with me,

00:44:20.375 --> 00:44:21.750 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the FBI was directed
to drop the case against him,

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:25.690 align:middle line:90%
and that's what happened.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Nothing went any further.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And so these are
all piecemeal stuff

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.475 align:middle line:84%
that people over the
years pick up fragments

00:44:31.475 --> 00:44:33.850 align:middle line:84%
from because they don't have
any idea of the true stories

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:34.650 align:middle line:90%
of anything.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.520 align:middle line:84%
They just get bits and
pieces, and then they

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.936 align:middle line:84%
throw together
this story and say,

00:44:37.936 --> 00:44:41.170 align:middle line:84%
oh look, George, bad George
this, and bad George that.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And they have no idea what
they're talking about.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:46.750 align:middle line:84%
As my father called it, children
tripping over their own feet.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:50.217 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, let's talk about
the way the craft operated.

00:44:50.217 --> 00:44:52.300 align:middle line:84%
We won't go too much into
that because we actually

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.850 align:middle line:84%
don't have a lot of
time left, and also

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:56.655 align:middle line:84%
go into the subject
of he explained

00:44:56.655 --> 00:44:59.080 align:middle line:84%
geomagnetism, the
fields that intersect

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.210 align:middle line:84%
with those of nearby
planets, creating

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.805 align:middle line:84%
this kind of constant
supply of cosmic energy.

00:45:03.805 --> 00:45:06.324 align:middle line:90%
He called it rivers of energy.

00:45:06.324 --> 00:45:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we think, oh, once you
get out of this atmosphere,

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.160 align:middle line:90%
it's just there's nothing there.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.110 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:90%
He's saying no, not at all.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.550 align:middle line:90%
That's not how it works.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Every body, every
planetary star,

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:84%
body out there is
casting off these kind

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:90%
of geomagnetic rings.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.620 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that a little bit.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.685 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: First we
have a great ignorance

00:45:24.685 --> 00:45:25.900 align:middle line:90%
of what happens in space.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But we are slowly opening the
veil of that information too.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:33.340 align:middle line:84%
In reality, space itself is
in constant motion, as is we.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And there are huge
electromagnetic storms.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.630 align:middle line:90%
There are huge solar flares.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.685 align:middle line:84%
The entire cosmos
has representations

00:45:41.685 --> 00:45:43.810 align:middle line:84%
very similar to what we
have in our atmosphere that

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:47.200 align:middle line:84%
are spread on gigantic
scales in comparison.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So the travel in space
from point A to point B

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:53.500 align:middle line:84%
is a very intricate and
sophisticated means.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not warp speed, Scotty.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:90%
That's just a novelty.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to have
that technology that's

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:03.600 align:middle line:84%
3,000 or 4,000 years ahead
of us for deep space travel,

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.190 align:middle line:84%
it requires an immense
amount of advancement.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.290 align:middle line:84%
That advancement
also will parallel

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.085 align:middle line:84%
sociological
advancement as well.

00:46:10.085 --> 00:46:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: You have to.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.820 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have one
without the other.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Even on this world, where
we have a great deal

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.220 align:middle line:84%
scientifically-- and I believe
it was Einstein who said we are

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.050 align:middle line:90%
still sociological morons--

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:22.240 align:middle line:84%
we still have been pulled
up from the Dark Ages

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.385 align:middle line:84%
and the Middle Ages, even
though it's at the same levels.

00:46:25.385 --> 00:46:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With some
dangerous toys now.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: With
very dangerous toys.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the recognition of what
really is happening in space

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.690 align:middle line:90%
is far more complex.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, when George
worked in the pro-gravity

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.710 align:middle line:90%
field-- not anti.

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:41.110 align:middle line:84%
There's not
anti-gravity, antimatter,

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:45.680 align:middle line:84%
because if you understand
it rudimentary,

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.070 align:middle line:84%
the planet puts out trillions
and trillions of watts

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:49.150 align:middle line:90%
of power and electricity.

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:51.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a giant Van de
Graaff generator.

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And in order to anti that,
you would have to produce,

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:57.190 align:middle line:84%
let's say, 5 trillion
megawatts of power

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:01.090 align:middle line:84%
just to get to a zero state, and
then produce another 5 trillion

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.801 align:middle line:84%
in order to get to an
anti-full power state.

00:47:03.801 --> 00:47:06.175 align:middle line:84%
That's 10 trillion when you
don't have to do any of that.

00:47:06.175 --> 00:47:09.876 align:middle line:84%
It's a waste of time,
energy, and scientific push.

00:47:09.876 --> 00:47:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you do is merge
with the power that is already

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:14.300 align:middle line:90%
generated here, the planet.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you turn on
that frequency and you

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.140 align:middle line:84%
travel at the speed of
magnetism outbound--

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's twice
the speed of light.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Think about that,
360,000 miles per second.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:27.520 align:middle line:84%
The Moon is only
250,000 miles away.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.190 align:middle line:84%
In less than a second,
you've gone that distance.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you tune in the
frequency of the next planet

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.740 align:middle line:90%
and which you are going to.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And using them as
a jumper point,

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.070 align:middle line:90%
you continue down the chain.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:41.706 align:middle line:84%
So it requires, one, that
you have mapped the planets,

00:47:41.706 --> 00:47:43.330 align:middle line:84%
that you have mapped
their frequencies,

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:44.956 align:middle line:84%
and you understand
the forces involved.

00:47:44.956 --> 00:47:45.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:45.755 --> 00:47:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And this type of
transportation, free energy

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.120 align:middle line:84%
transportation, precludes
rockets, ionic rockets,

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and nuclear rockets.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.400 align:middle line:84%
We are still at a very
rudimentary stage.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.658 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: George
worked together

00:47:57.658 --> 00:48:00.070 align:middle line:84%
with people like TT Brown,
who anybody in this field

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.200 align:middle line:84%
will understand,
Agnew Bahnson, who

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.350 align:middle line:84%
also had a laboratory in
the Carolinas, pro-gravity.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And they worked with a lot
of known scientific names.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I have some of those files that
I got from the son of Bahnson

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:12.280 align:middle line:90%
recently.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And that shows how they started
to apply those frequencies

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and those type of power ranges
in order to attain what we

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.692 align:middle line:84%
would call a neutral
gravity or a pro-gravity--

00:48:24.692 --> 00:48:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
progravitic field.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:27.191 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: --the field.

00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the
book it was saying,

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Adamski stated that once
you get to that point,

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.990 align:middle line:84%
it takes very,
very little energy

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:36.610 align:middle line:90%
to continue the propulsion.

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Think about it.

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very little.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: If you come
to a weightless state,

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.680 align:middle line:84%
think about it if you go
swimming in the ocean.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.750 align:middle line:84%
You put on a scuba
tank, and you're

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.350 align:middle line:90%
hanging neutrally buoyant.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.620 align:middle line:84%
All you take is one kick
of the fin, and off you go.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.409 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And if you then
can incorporate that with

00:48:50.409 --> 00:48:51.835 align:middle line:90%
the magnetic lanes or currents--

00:48:51.835 --> 00:48:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those rivers
of energy, yeah.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.168 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --or
rivers, like a rip tide

00:48:55.168 --> 00:48:57.400 align:middle line:84%
if you get caught on
it, it carries you along

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.120 align:middle line:84%
at the velocity
upon which it goes.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:48:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: This is
very, very simple.

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Simple
but still beyond--

00:49:04.385 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: It was described
that a seven-year-old could

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.560 align:middle line:90%
understand it.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
yes, it's beautiful

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:10.100 align:middle line:90%
the way he lays it out.

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:13.390 align:middle line:90%
I just love the science of it.

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.340 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple other
areas we can go into,

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.440 align:middle line:84%
but I thought we might
go in and touch into,

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.157 align:middle line:84%
for the last few minutes,
on the lunar anomalies,

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:22.240 align:middle line:84%
because this is something
that you and your father

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.040 align:middle line:90%
also heavily researched.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And George had been taken
to the Moon as well.

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:27.569 align:middle line:90%
And what did he find?

00:49:27.569 --> 00:49:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: George
went up to orbit,

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:31.401 align:middle line:84%
and he also was taken around
the Moon as well in orbit.

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:33.020 align:middle line:90%
And he described several things.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:38.030 align:middle line:10%
One, a sporadic lunar
atmosphere, clouds and mists,

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:40.375 align:middle line:10%
varying moving lights
of different colors

00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:45.220 align:middle line:10%
and dimensions, water,
and so on and so forth.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And everybody said, ha ha
ha, the Moon is a dead place,

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:48.910 align:middle line:90%
nonsense.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Yet I have the NASA
documents, the 1966 report,

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.480 align:middle line:84%
which is a chronology of
lunar observations, which

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.800 align:middle line:84%
describe exactly the
same thing independently.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.730 align:middle line:10%
Then through the
contacts at NASA,

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:05.642 align:middle line:10%
dad got access to the
microfilms in the '70s,

00:50:05.642 --> 00:50:07.600 align:middle line:10%
and we ordered all these
pictures, which remain

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.190 align:middle line:10%
in our archives and vaults.

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And they are replicated in the
book "Alien Bases on the Moon."

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And it shows
atmosphere, the reports

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:23.140 align:middle line:84%
of water geysers spraying
for 14 hours from 1971.

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.140 align:middle line:84%
The astronauts
reporting it looks

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.510 align:middle line:84%
like we're flying over
a clear mountain lake.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It shows mists on the craters.

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:31.740 align:middle line:84%
It shows areas of activity,
the Straight Wall,

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Alpine Valley, Aristarchus,
Gassendi, Archimedes,

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.200 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And so this congruent
statement between what Adamski

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.170 align:middle line:84%
had witnessed and what
our own people had

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:46.620 align:middle line:84%
witnessed over the years tie
in systematically together.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And this, once again, just
drives the critics up the wall.

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Because every time
they turn around,

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.910 align:middle line:84%
there's reaffirmation
of what George said.

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:55.530 align:middle line:90%
And that continues to this day.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you said
there are structures

00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:57.210 align:middle line:90%
on the back side of the Moon.

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolute.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:50:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's life.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:59.826 align:middle line:90%
There's structures.

00:50:59.826 --> 00:51:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They
show what looks

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.290 align:middle line:84%
like pyramidal
structures, or large tanks

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:08.550 align:middle line:84%
like we would have our oil tanks
that are in certain refineries.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.560 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned the
secret space program.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: There is
definitely a tangent program

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:16.470 align:middle line:84%
that is done out of the
sight of the public.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember having that
conversation with John Lear.

00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:21.660 align:middle line:84%
We flew together and served
in airplanes together.

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And although I cannot agree
with a lot of what he says,

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.890 align:middle line:84%
there are some things that
we have common ground.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And so he was talking
about where could they

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.900 align:middle line:84%
possibly launch that
would not be visible?

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I discussed
a couple locations,

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and so they were affirmed,
not by him but by others

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.050 align:middle line:84%
as well, which were areas
located in equatorial ranges

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.660 align:middle line:84%
as far downstream in the Indian
Ocean so that by the time

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.220 align:middle line:84%
they reached orbit,
it could never

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.470 align:middle line:84%
be seen on the United
States land mass.

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It detracts by, of
course, by NORAD or what

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.485 align:middle line:90%
has now become Space Command.

00:51:51.485 --> 00:51:52.360 align:middle line:90%
But that's different.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.340 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that we
went to the Moon,

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.366 align:middle line:84%
that there's activity
there, George Leonard

00:51:57.366 --> 00:51:59.490 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called "Somebody
Else Is on the Moon."

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:01.650 align:middle line:90%
He was one of the first in '76.

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:04.410 align:middle line:84%
We were the second in '81
with many more pictures.

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
book by William Brian,

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:10.590 align:middle line:84%
was in '83, called "Moongate,"
the unofficial space program.

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.920 align:middle line:84%
We were pretty much
the launch pioneers

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.280 align:middle line:84%
of this investigation of the
lunar anomaly and activity.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Many, many years later,
and then a lot of this

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:22.290 align:middle line:84%
is copied and re-digested,
the interesting thing

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:25.430 align:middle line:84%
is I recently saw a
lunar anomaly program,

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and they showed pictures
from the book, our book.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.360 align:middle line:90%
But they never give credit.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.650 align:middle line:90%
They never show the cover.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:32.566 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:52:32.566 --> 00:52:35.265 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They want
absolutely no reference

00:52:35.265 --> 00:52:37.650 align:middle line:90%
of material and Adamski.

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:40.860 align:middle line:84%
When you tie those two
together, you become ostracized.

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Now I can't
tell you how many conventions

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.400 align:middle line:90%
I've gone to.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.290 align:middle line:84%
The latest one, whether I speak
or not is inconsequential.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:50.490 align:middle line:84%
But I offered them
to show the film.

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Just by themselves, because
everybody's interested--

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: They denied.

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.355 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
anything to do with it.

00:52:55.355 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, this is
a really fractured community,

00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.010 align:middle line:90%
to say the least.

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Two questions, did he
believe that the Moon--

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did your
dad and you believe

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.674 align:middle line:90%
the Moon landings were faked?

00:53:05.674 --> 00:53:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely not.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.256 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You felt
they were real.

00:53:08.256 --> 00:53:10.749 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely
real, because, once again,

00:53:10.749 --> 00:53:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I was asked that question
during a lecture,

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.879 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I lived
through that time.

00:53:14.879 --> 00:53:15.712 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps they didn't.

00:53:15.712 --> 00:53:16.860 align:middle line:90%
They were too young.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But when you watched
Apollo launch off the pad,

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:22.380 align:middle line:84%
not only did the official
tracking stations

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.770 align:middle line:84%
follow Apollo to the Moon, but
hundreds of amateur astronomers

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:28.380 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet and all
the different continents

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.650 align:middle line:84%
during the specific
times of viewing

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.930 align:middle line:84%
for their particular zone, would
watch Apollo go to the Moon.

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So when I pointed this
out to the people,

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.660 align:middle line:84%
they said, well, we
didn't think about that.

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it was just
empty or remote control.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.670 align:middle line:84%
They cannot justify
their point of view,

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.890 align:middle line:84%
because every time you
point it out differently,

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:52.300 align:middle line:84%
then they try to fall back
on some kind of other stance.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and there's
some kind of nuanced position,

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.850 align:middle line:84%
too, that yes we did
land on the Moon,

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:57.410 align:middle line:84%
but that the video
they showed was

00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.490 align:middle line:90%
staged for its own purposes.

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe there
were some inconveniences

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.574 align:middle line:84%
of what was being
shown on the Moon,

00:54:03.574 --> 00:54:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't necessarily
want that going to the public.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's another stance.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, it
comes from two things.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.680 align:middle line:84%
One, the movie "Capricorn
One," if you recall,

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:16.060 align:middle line:84%
in which they staged
that particular theme.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They staged that,
and then of course something

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.040 align:middle line:84%
happened to the capsule, and
these guys were supposedly dead

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.590 align:middle line:84%
when, of course, they
never left the ground,

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and a whole movie
based upon that.

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.610 align:middle line:90%
So people have grasped on that.

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, you have to
remember that there was a time

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.150 align:middle line:90%
lag in the broadcast sequence.

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And all these sequences
didn't go directly

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.500 align:middle line:90%
to your television set live.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a time lag
due to distance,

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.620 align:middle line:84%
going through the home
station, and then selectively

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.400 align:middle line:90%
going out from there.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So in order to negate any
type of unwanted attention

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.250 align:middle line:84%
or information, they didn't
have to stage anything.

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:55.310 align:middle line:84%
They simply didn't continue
it in the video loop.

00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:56.350 align:middle line:90%
It was that simple.

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Because when you
look at the other video loops,

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:02.190 align:middle line:84%
you look at astronaut
Young with a full pack,

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.600 align:middle line:84%
jump about 15 inches, as high as
he could on the lunar surface.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Under 1/6 gravity,
if it was really so,

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.740 align:middle line:90%
he'd have jumped 3 meters high.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.740 align:middle line:84%
When they took that Frisbee
and threw it around,

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:15.570 align:middle line:84%
there had to be
atmospheric pressure

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:17.790 align:middle line:90%
to sustain that body in the air.

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.130 align:middle line:84%
When you watch the lunar
rover drive around,

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.320 align:middle line:84%
you can see the particles
plume off the back,

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.030 align:middle line:84%
just like if you're driving your
dune buggy out in the desert.

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.438 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And they
fall to the ground.

00:55:26.438 --> 00:55:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Without atmosphere to hold
it, it would continue to go.

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And without gravity it
would continue to go.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And it plumes and falls
right back to the surface.

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:36.900 align:middle line:84%
These are the facts
and the inconsistencies

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.160 align:middle line:90%
that we continue to point out.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.635 align:middle line:84%
And they're available to
all who wish to see them.

00:55:40.635 --> 00:55:42.760 align:middle line:84%
They just sometimes don't
put two and two together.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, one final question
because we're out of time.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is, do you
think, when you're

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:50.857 align:middle line:84%
dealing with these different
agencies in the military

00:55:50.857 --> 00:55:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence, that the
right hand often doesn't know

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.900 align:middle line:90%
what the left hand is doing?

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:59.820 align:middle line:84%
In that, for example, here
on one hand, early on Adamski

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.160 align:middle line:84%
was exposed to the fact that
there is life on the Moon.

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.810 align:middle line:84%
There are structures
on the Moon.

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:06.340 align:middle line:84%
It's relatively
habitable in that sense.

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, it has
bodies of water,

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:11.240 align:middle line:84%
enough that beings from
somewhere are building.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
you have a program out

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:16.620 align:middle line:84%
of Vandenberg Air Force
Base in '60s, I believe,

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:19.230 align:middle line:84%
late '60s, trying to
launch a nuclear missile

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:22.679 align:middle line:84%
toward the Moon, which
is life-destroying.

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Is it that they know that
and they're doing that,

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.060 align:middle line:90%
or each one isn't really--

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.950 align:middle line:90%
what is this about?

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I describe
it like an onion.

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:32.310 align:middle line:90%
You have the surface.

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:34.680 align:middle line:84%
This is your
political structure.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.480 align:middle line:84%
The people in Congress,
the president, these people

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.280 align:middle line:90%
know nothing.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:39.790 align:middle line:84%
They're not given
access to anything.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:41.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the clearance
for it and will never have it.

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.281 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: This is the
peripheral that is there

00:56:44.281 --> 00:56:45.970 align:middle line:90%
designed to satiate the public.

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.311 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: You
have a lower section

00:56:48.311 --> 00:56:51.240 align:middle line:84%
of that that may be comprised
of high commissioned officers

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.830 align:middle line:90%
and other notable people.

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:56.804 align:middle line:84%
This still isn't the level
that's aware of it as well.

00:56:56.804 --> 00:56:59.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to go deeper and
deeper into this structure, four

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.400 align:middle line:84%
or five layers, before
you start finding

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.780 align:middle line:84%
that those who have
some information

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.885 align:middle line:84%
are working on one
side of a project.

00:57:05.885 --> 00:57:07.260 align:middle line:84%
On the other side
of the project,

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.030 align:middle line:84%
you have people working
on something else.

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:11.347 align:middle line:84%
They don't know, because
they're designed not to,

00:57:11.347 --> 00:57:12.930 align:middle line:84%
because that information
is eventually

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:14.970 align:middle line:84%
going to come together
by a third party

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and be used the
way they want to.

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So quickly, we have our
natural development,

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the things that you see out at
Skunk Works, the U-2, the SR-

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:24.930 align:middle line:90%
71, the Aurora.

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:28.560 align:middle line:84%
These are natural developments
of known engineering systems

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.319 align:middle line:90%
that they progressed themselves.

00:57:30.319 --> 00:57:31.860 align:middle line:84%
This is completely
separate of what's

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.610 align:middle line:90%
used technology-wise underneath.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:36.368 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so when
we use that technology

00:57:36.368 --> 00:57:39.180 align:middle line:84%
to go to the Moon, like the book
"Alternative 3" spoke about,

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and we have also
recruited people

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to help build these lunar bases,
which don't get to come back.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.260 align:middle line:90%
They are the manual laborers.

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody is taking
people off this world,

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.340 align:middle line:90%
it is not the aliens.

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.140 align:middle line:90%
It's us.

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And we can find
that attributed many times

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:55.950 align:middle line:84%
to many of the activities that
was reported on this world

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:58.620 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do with
extraterrestrial visitations.

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:00.360 align:middle line:90%
It's our misunderstanding of it.

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have, therefore, a very
convoluted complex system

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:12.630 align:middle line:84%
upon which this entire realm
of information-- and it

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:14.250 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't have
to do with UFOs.

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
foreign policy.

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:18.330 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
association with the Russians.

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:20.880 align:middle line:84%
We were working scientifically
with the Russians already

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.440 align:middle line:90%
since the '60s and '70s.

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Soyuz was a joint operation.

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:29.070 align:middle line:84%
The American public is
highly uninformed about what

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:30.100 align:middle line:90%
is really going on.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so we use these
divisions to separate people.

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.825 align:middle line:84%
And we say, oh, the bad
them, the bad this, and we

00:58:37.825 --> 00:58:38.700 align:middle line:90%
can't deal with them.

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Underneath it, we
deal with everybody.

00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:43.866 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: There
are no borders.

00:58:43.866 --> 00:58:45.370 align:middle line:90%
There are no nationalism.

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:47.406 align:middle line:84%
There is no religious
distinction.

00:58:47.406 --> 00:58:49.530 align:middle line:84%
You have a one-world
government, and you don't even

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:52.830 align:middle line:90%
know about it, officially.

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
officially, very good,

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.790 align:middle line:84%
on that note, one
quick question, have we

00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:01.030 align:middle line:84%
back-engineered that
progravitic technology yet?

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yes.

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I will say
that we have back-engineered

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:07.200 align:middle line:90%
that since the '60s.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.870 align:middle line:84%
There are reports that we
have been actively involved

00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:12.540 align:middle line:84%
in building our own
installations on the Moon.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:15.217 align:middle line:84%
And some have even suggested
we've gone as far as Mars--

00:59:15.217 --> 00:59:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mars, yes.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --with this
particular development.

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:22.800 align:middle line:90%
And so it's limited.

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.990 align:middle line:90%
But it is operational.

00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And about, at that time, during
the '70s and '80s, about 50%

00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:33.000 align:middle line:84%
of what we witnessed around the
world was our own machinery.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Anything that was triangular,
had appendages hanging off

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.060 align:middle line:84%
of it, landing gear, things
like that, that's all our stuff.

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:44.270 align:middle line:10%
Now the percentage is as high as
probably 75%, with our drones,

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:46.950 align:middle line:10%
are ROVs, all these other
types of development

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:51.030 align:middle line:10%
that we have developed in our
military industrialist complex.

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:53.480 align:middle line:10%
So but still 25% represent--

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:54.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Visitors.

00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.860 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: --actual
UFO visitors.

00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you one thing.

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to see them.

00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm glad.

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much for
carrying this work forward.

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad that
you bought a new one,

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:07.730 align:middle line:84%
but you still continue carrying
the briefcase with you.

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Yeah, I'm
more than happy to make

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.120 align:middle line:84%
myself available to
whomever wishes to listen.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.504 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just like Adamski was.

01:00:13.504 --> 01:00:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That's correct.

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Glenn.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.484 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Thank
you so much, Regina.

01:00:17.484 --> 01:00:18.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I'm
repeatedly struck by

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.080 align:middle line:10%
the intelligent, youthful, and
gentle nature of George Adamski

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.070 align:middle line:10%
and wonder why these voices
have been minimized in favor

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:27.080 align:middle line:10%
of the big conspiracy stories.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.690 align:middle line:84%
In the end, it's up to
us to decide who stood

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.640 align:middle line:90%
to gain from their silencing.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you can
do your own research

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.520 align:middle line:84%
by contacting Glenn at
GeorgeAdamskiFoundation.com.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here on Gaia.
