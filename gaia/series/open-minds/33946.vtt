>> Regina Meredith: There
are severe repercussions

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.991 align:middle line:84%
for most people who take
the path of whistleblower.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you add large sums
of money to the equation,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.796 align:middle line:84%
the game can become
down right mean.

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:31.931 align:middle line:84%
Karen Hudes became an
inadvertent whistleblower when,

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.701 align:middle line:84%
as an attorney for
the World Bank,

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:84%
she began seeing corruption
throughout the system.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.039 align:middle line:84%
When she took it to the upper
echelon, she was ignored.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.542 align:middle line:84%
When she became more
insistent, she was fired.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.645 align:middle line:84%
Karen is with us today to tell
us why her findings should

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:90%
matter to all of us.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.548 align:middle line:90%
And welcome, Karen.

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:48.849 align:middle line:90%
It's so nice to have you here.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:51.185 align:middle line:84%
I've been very interested
in meeting you.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You've been to quite
a bit lately

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.321 align:middle line:90%
and over the last several years

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.158 align:middle line:84%
and it's not an easy
path you've chosen.

00:00:57.158 --> 00:01:01.162 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, you have
an audience here that, really,

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:04.365 align:middle line:84%
I think most of us don't really
understand the nature of the IMF

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:07.568 align:middle line:84%
and the World Bank and you
in conspiracies [inaudible]

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:11.572 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes even more kind of
confused, clouded, and shadowed.

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.942 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you're saying what
is happening at that level

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:18.979 align:middle line:84%
and your own story within it
should matter to all of us

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.382 align:middle line:84%
because we're in
precarious situation.

00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:23.184 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us what that means?

00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:24.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Karen Hudes: Yes,
Regina, and thank you

00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:90%
so much for having me here.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.788 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That was my pleasure.

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.491 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, this
matters a great deal

00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:35.329 align:middle line:84%
and the reason it matters is
because we are on the very edge

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.465 align:middle line:90%
of a total financial meltdown.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.434 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
it's so difficult

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:44.371 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's going on
is it's not that complicated,

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:47.908 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell your listeners
just how straightforward it is.

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:49.944 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
There are crooks and they're
trying to hide themselves

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.283 align:middle line:84%
and they bought up all
the media, all the press,

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:59.153 align:middle line:84%
and they are trying to keep
everybody from fighting

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:01.822 align:middle line:84%
out the simple facts
and the simple truth.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:04.391 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell everybody
what those facts are.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:05.693 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:08.062 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And they will join
me and the rest of the team

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:10.898 align:middle line:84%
because I'm one of a whole
slew of whistleblowers.

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:12.466 align:middle line:90%
We're all working together.

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
We've got 188 Ministers
of Finance behind us.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.706 align:middle line:84%
We have got the whole
world behind us.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:21.875 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have the
American public behind us.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.245 align:middle line:84%
And once everybody
hears the facts,

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:25.946 align:middle line:84%
they'll be behind
us too, I'm sure.

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.415 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I'm sure, but again,
you're trying to blast

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
through this, you have to know
we were talking off camera.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.824 align:middle line:84%
The options for becoming
educated are so clouded.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first, if you
go to mainstream media,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.095 align:middle line:90%
which people do by habit.

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:43.163 align:middle line:84%
And they build-- you
know, every now and then,

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.299 align:middle line:84%
they'll do something
that's intriguing and juicy

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
where you think, "Oh,
they're really trying

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.735 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference."

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:49.836 align:middle line:84%
Well, at-- you know, that's
almost like a lost lead

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.372 align:middle line:90%
or item at a sale on a store.

00:02:51.372 --> 00:02:53.139 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- they're
tossing it out there.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.009 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is if you
want real information,

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to get it there.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.113 align:middle line:84%
And off camera, you
were saying that many

00:02:59.113 --> 00:03:00.681 align:middle line:90%
of the other alternative means

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.584 align:middle line:84%
of finding information
are really just a part

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:08.656 align:middle line:84%
of the stretch, the reach of the
same cabal that runs the media.

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:11.358 align:middle line:84%
So how do people
even begin sorting

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
through what's true
and what's not.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.429 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the big questions.

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.197 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Nobody's going
to hand truth

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.566 align:middle line:90%
to somebody on a silver platter.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.336 align:middle line:84%
People have got to learn
how to be discerning.

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:23.437 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:26.106 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And when you
hear what I have to say,

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:29.643 align:middle line:84%
it's going to sound very
straightforward and you're going

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:32.012 align:middle line:84%
to say, "My goodness, how
could they have covered

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:35.382 align:middle line:84%
up such a simple
fact for so long?"

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:41.522 align:middle line:84%
And the simple fact is that
the banks are all in cahoots.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:43.389 align:middle line:90%
They're all one organization.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.994 align:middle line:84%
The same directors go from
one bank to the other,

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:48.862 align:middle line:84%
they tell each other
what's going on,

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:50.264 align:middle line:90%
and they work together.

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:51.565 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:53.734 align:middle line:84%
The countries of the world
are now all working together

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.203 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying that
those crooks are going

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:57.571 align:middle line:90%
to play by the rules.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:01.809 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of "it's
our world and we have a right

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.178 align:middle line:84%
to have crooks play
by the rules."

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:05.179 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:06.013 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you've
really been trying

00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:07.381 align:middle line:90%
to uphold this for a long time.

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:10.551 align:middle line:84%
You're like a girl scout in
the midst of all of it almost.

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:13.253 align:middle line:84%
But, one thing you
came in contact

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:84%
with was some information that
was really more mathematical

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
in nature in trying to sort
out where the essential power

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.197 align:middle line:90%
within banking systems existed.

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And there was a word that came
out of that that this very group

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.437 align:middle line:84%
that was analyzing all this
data mathematically came to

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.073 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
"super entity."

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:33.841 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: That's right.

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:34.842 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The super entity.

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:36.243 align:middle line:90%
We call it the cabal.

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:37.745 align:middle line:90%
You can call it the elite.

00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:40.481 align:middle line:84%
You can call it many things,
but you like the term they came

00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:41.849 align:middle line:90%
up with which is super entity.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.218 align:middle line:84%
So if we use that again
during the conversation,

00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:46.453 align:middle line:84%
I'm just stating it upfront
because that's when--

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:49.456 align:middle line:84%
an independent group came to
through a mathematical model

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.358 align:middle line:84%
and said, "In banking
world, you--

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:52.726 align:middle line:84%
" please tell what
their findings were,

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.294 align:middle line:90%
just what you said.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:58.399 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: What they did was they
took very accurate information

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:02.436 align:middle line:84%
about the 43,000 transnational
companies that are traded

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:04.972 align:middle line:84%
on the stock markets
of the world.

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:08.675 align:middle line:84%
And they look to see
who was in control

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:10.878 align:middle line:90%
and they were very astonished.

00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:14.014 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that-- yeah, this
group has a fair amount of money

00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:17.851 align:middle line:84%
but the power that they had
grabbed was 10 times more

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:19.686 align:middle line:84%
than you would have
otherwise expected

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:24.591 align:middle line:84%
because they secretly put the
same people on the same boards.

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:27.294 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody
could compare notes.

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
That's why the LIBOR
rate was rigged.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.465 align:middle line:90%
All of the markets are rigged.

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:35.269 align:middle line:84%
If you are trying to invest
in the capital market,

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.172 align:middle line:84%
there may be insider
trading for everybody else

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:42.409 align:middle line:84%
but for those financial
institutions, they're, you know,

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.011 align:middle line:84%
they've got everybody
coming and going

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:46.713 align:middle line:90%
and the SEC is captured by them.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:49.083 align:middle line:84%
That's called regulatory
capture.

00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:51.517 align:middle line:90%
I have been reporting to the SEC

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:54.354 align:middle line:84%
about how the World Bank
was breaking the rules

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.956 align:middle line:90%
on financial disclosure.

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:57.224 align:middle line:90%
The SEC was not home.

00:05:57.224 --> 00:05:58.192 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:05:58.192 --> 00:05:59.726 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: The SEC would
not do anything.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:04.498 align:middle line:84%
But the point about
being a lawyer who went

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:09.570 align:middle line:84%
to Yale Law School is I know how
to document this, and so I did.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.705 align:middle line:84%
And all of the letters
that I wrote to the SEC

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.607 align:middle line:84%
and all the other
government entities

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:16.977 align:middle line:84%
that were not doing their
job because they were part

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:19.847 align:middle line:90%
of that regulatory capture.

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.181 align:middle line:90%
You can read the letters.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:24.351 align:middle line:84%
You can then get in touch
with your government officials

00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.387 align:middle line:84%
and you can say, "Why weren't
you answering those letters?"

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.789 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:34.061 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: But, you know, I went to
the European Parliament in 2011.

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:37.464 align:middle line:84%
I testified for them and
the European Parliament took

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:38.732 align:middle line:90%
a chronology.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what they-- I said
what to whom and they sent

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.838 align:middle line:84%
that chronology to
the World Bank.

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:47.174 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "What do you
have to say about this?"

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:49.843 align:middle line:90%
So that was in 2011.

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:53.313 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2012, I
got two statements

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:55.048 align:middle line:90%
up on the UK Parliament.

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:56.315 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:59.586 align:middle line:84%
One of the World Bank
whistleblowers is in Scotland

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and the two of us
worked together and I met

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.426 align:middle line:84%
with the UK Serious
Fraud Office in 2010.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.896 align:middle line:84%
The Serious Fraud
Office called up the SEC.

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.597 align:middle line:90%
The SEC stonewalled.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.166 align:middle line:84%
And so when the UK
Parliament wanted

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:17.104 align:middle line:84%
to know whether the UK
money that was going

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:19.273 align:middle line:90%
for development assistant,

00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:22.943 align:middle line:84%
whether that was being spent
properly, I wrote them a letter.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:26.713 align:middle line:84%
I said the SEC stonewalled
the Serious Fraud Office.

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:29.383 align:middle line:84%
No. The money is not
going the right way.

00:07:29.383 --> 00:07:30.751 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, and
there's-- this is--

00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:33.687 align:middle line:84%
the system is right for this
and we really need to now back

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
up a bit and go to-- first
of all, give us a little bit

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.025 align:middle line:84%
of background about
yourself before we go

00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:41.528 align:middle line:84%
into what the World Bank
is, how it was formed,

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:44.464 align:middle line:84%
what it's supposed to do, but
what is actually happening.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.767 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a story
most people really truly do

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:48.168 align:middle line:90%
not understand.

00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:49.836 align:middle line:90%
So, your own background.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:52.339 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you're a
very smart lawyer,

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:54.007 align:middle line:90%
but you went beyond that.

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:58.645 align:middle line:84%
You also got a degree in Europe
from the University of Amsterdam

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.948 align:middle line:84%
as I recall in economics
as well,

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:03.617 align:middle line:84%
so you're uniquely
situated to be

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:05.986 align:middle line:84%
in the position you're
in for good or bad.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.722 align:middle line:84%
Talk a little bit about that
and what have you really desired

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:90%
to do with this career path

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.327 align:middle line:84%
when you're young compared
to where you are now?

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.362 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, I'm a
very persistent soul,

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and the other thing that
people ought to know

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.401 align:middle line:84%
about me is I was captain
of the NYU fencing team.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:25.105 align:middle line:84%
So when people started
retaliating against me,

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:27.674 align:middle line:84%
I remembered what my
Hungarian fencing taught--

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.477 align:middle line:84%
coach had taught me, which was
see what foot they're on and go

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:31.878 align:middle line:90%
in from the other side.

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:34.681 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And this really-- this
had to be almost spontaneous,

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.550 align:middle line:84%
intuitive part of
your development.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.652 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, he taught
me not to be intimidated.

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:41.555 align:middle line:84%
When you get rattled and
lose your concentration,

00:08:41.555 --> 00:08:44.858 align:middle line:84%
you're wasting a very
good moment which is

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.126 align:middle line:90%
when they're vulnerable,

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:48.762 align:middle line:84%
when somebody is attacking
you, they're off-balance.

00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:50.998 align:middle line:90%
They can't defend and attack.

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:53.900 align:middle line:90%
You simple defend and attack.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.903 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm going to
tell your listeners,

00:08:56.903 --> 00:09:00.107 align:middle line:90%
we got them on the riposte.

00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:01.475 align:middle line:84%
That's-- when somebody's
coming in to you,

00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:03.176 align:middle line:90%
you parry and you riposte.

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:07.814 align:middle line:84%
The last riposte that I did
was on the 22nd of July,

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:11.251 align:middle line:84%
which is when the Department
of Justice had arrested me

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.487 align:middle line:90%
for criminal trespass.

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:14.721 align:middle line:84%
They were ready to
throw me in jail.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:15.822 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:16.823 align:middle line:84%
Now, we need to get
the back story on that.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:18.025 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, "What
is this lady--

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:19.459 align:middle line:84%
what do they mean
they threw in jail?

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:90%
For what?"

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.261 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:22.295 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: They actually
did throw me in jail.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.831 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I know, so
let's back up a bit.

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:28.368 align:middle line:84%
OK. So you ended up-- you
were-- when you were young,

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:31.038 align:middle line:84%
you were still new in
your career and you ended

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:33.473 align:middle line:84%
up as an attorney
with the World Bank.

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:34.841 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:37.744 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of an interesting
story but how you got there,

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.646 align:middle line:84%
who brought you in,
and who you've been

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:41.481 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with
this whole time.

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:43.383 align:middle line:84%
Give us a little bit of
the back story there.

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:44.651 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: OK.

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:47.487 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, as I
told you all, I'm persistent.

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:50.957 align:middle line:84%
So I got hired on
my fifth interview.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:53.927 align:middle line:84%
My first interview was
right out of law school

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.396 align:middle line:84%
because I studied
development economics.

00:09:56.396 --> 00:10:00.867 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a lawyer and
you want to fight poverty,

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:02.169 align:middle line:84%
the World Bank is
the place to go.

00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:06.106 align:middle line:84%
That's where you can be both
a lawyer and an economist.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:11.144 align:middle line:84%
So, they said, "Well, Karen,
you may know a little bit,

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:13.613 align:middle line:84%
but you've never really
worked as a professional.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:17.117 align:middle line:84%
Go get your-- go learn
how to be a lawyer."

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:20.821 align:middle line:84%
So I went to a big law
firm, Wall Street law firm,

00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:22.789 align:middle line:90%
and I learned securities law.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.725 align:middle line:84%
And then I went back
and they said, "Well,

00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:28.095 align:middle line:84%
you may know securities
law but you never worked

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:29.529 align:middle line:90%
for a financial institution."

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:32.065 align:middle line:84%
So I went to US Export-Import
Bank

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:36.169 align:middle line:84%
which finances one-third
the amount of the World Bank

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:39.172 align:middle line:84%
but what it is is it's
financing exports.

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:40.507 align:middle line:90%
They called it Boeing's Bank.

00:10:40.507 --> 00:10:43.643 align:middle line:84%
We were financing
the sale of aircraft.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.845 align:middle line:90%
And so I did that.

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I went back and,
you know, you don't need

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.049 align:middle line:84%
to make a whole long
story short.

00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:52.319 align:middle line:84%
One time, one of the people
in the interview found

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:55.822 align:middle line:84%
out that my mother who was an
elementary school principal had

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
lectured this man because his
daughter was getting frightened

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.294 align:middle line:90%
of math.

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:04.264 align:middle line:84%
And so, when he said, "Is your
mother Sylvia Hudes [assumed

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:06.433 align:middle line:84%
spelling]" I said, "Yes",
and I could see by his face

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:07.934 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't I get
the job that time.

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But, anyway, so I went
back another time.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.005 align:middle line:90%
And that time was good.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:15.242 align:middle line:84%
And the person who brought
me in was Ibrahim Shihata

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:18.645 align:middle line:84%
who was an Egyptian
who had worked at OPEC

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:21.782 align:middle line:84%
and became the World
Bank General Counsel.

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:24.184 align:middle line:90%
And so he hired me.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And the very first thing
he did was he put me

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.289 align:middle line:84%
on the Jordan desk
and the Yemen desk.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:32.859 align:middle line:84%
And I worked very happily in
the Middle East for 10 years.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.461 align:middle line:90%
And then he reassigned me

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:38.064 align:middle line:84%
because I started reporting
corruption in Yemen.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.065 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:40.801 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So you started
at what year?

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.369 align:middle line:90%
When you started reporting the--

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.038 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: I went to the
Word Bank in 1986.

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:45.872 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:49.876 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: And it was in 95 that--

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.044 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: I started reporting
corruption in Yemen.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.382 align:middle line:84%
And so I was moved
to the Philippines.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.218 align:middle line:84%
And then I started reporting
corruption in the Philippines.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.187 align:middle line:90%
I have a sixth sense for--

00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:01.121 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:01.655 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: -- corruption.

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:02.756 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:04.491 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure they're
saying, "Oh, my God,

00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:06.927 align:middle line:84%
who was responsible
for bringing her in?"

00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:09.696 align:middle line:84%
OK. Now, what we're going
to do is take a look

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:24.364 align:middle line:90%
of this has been accomplished."

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.699 align:middle line:90%
Let's to talk about that.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:29.302 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, there were 44
countries in that conference.

00:14:29.302 --> 00:14:32.606 align:middle line:84%
There are now 188
countries that are members

00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:34.574 align:middle line:90%
of the World Bank and IMF.

00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:38.611 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about trying
to prevent a world war

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:43.183 align:middle line:84%
because of currencies
being out of control.

00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:45.952 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we are right now.

00:14:45.952 --> 00:14:50.623 align:middle line:84%
We're preventing World War
III because, for example,

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve
Board has refused

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.729 align:middle line:90%
to give Germany back its gold.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:56.663 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:14:56.663 --> 00:14:58.131 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: That's an act of war.

00:14:58.131 --> 00:14:59.265 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:00.266 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they've
gotten away with that.

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.601 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: We are--

00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:02.769 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Seven years they said
before they're going to be--

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.537 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- taken care of.

00:15:04.537 --> 00:15:05.939 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: We are on the
very edge of a war.

00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:09.309 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy to tell you that
we're not going to have a war

00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:13.146 align:middle line:84%
because of the Bretton Woods
Institutions, because all,

00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:18.651 align:middle line:84%
188 ministers have
reinstated me as the lawyer

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:22.288 align:middle line:90%
who understands what's going on.

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:26.092 align:middle line:84%
When you have 188
countries in an organization,

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.161 align:middle line:84%
you have to pay attention
to them.

00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.997 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened
is there was a rule,

00:15:30.997 --> 00:15:32.665 align:middle line:84%
called the Gentlemen's
Agreement.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:35.001 align:middle line:84%
That the United States
could appoint the president

00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:38.271 align:middle line:84%
of the World Bank and the
Europeans could appoint the

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.073 align:middle line:90%
managing director of the IMF.

00:15:40.073 --> 00:15:42.442 align:middle line:90%
This lasted for 66 years.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:49.749 align:middle line:84%
And in 2004, I learned that if
the United States didn't stop

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:52.585 align:middle line:84%
all of this corruption,
that we were going

00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
to lose the Gentlemen's
Agreement.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.057 align:middle line:84%
That was a very accurate
stakeholder analysis

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:59.426 align:middle line:84%
that I saw this was
going to happen.

00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:02.529 align:middle line:84%
And I started trying to
get the problem solved.

00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I did what a lawyer
is supposed to do.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.398 align:middle line:90%
I went to the audit committee.

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:08.435 align:middle line:84%
I stayed internally
inside the World Bank.

00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:13.073 align:middle line:84%
And finally in 2007, I went
to the Treasury Department.

00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:14.808 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Treasury
Department

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.644 align:middle line:84%
through Larry Summers,
whose child was

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.647 align:middle line:84%
in the same elementary
school class as mine.

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:25.485 align:middle line:84%
I would see him at a PTA meeting
and I would start harassing him

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.953 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that
we were going

00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:28.755 align:middle line:84%
to lose the Gentlemen's
Agreement.

00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:33.293 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, in 2010,
that's exactly what happened.

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:35.528 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So if we back up for
a moment, you were trying

00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:36.896 align:middle line:90%
to warn them about this.

00:16:36.896 --> 00:16:39.432 align:middle line:84%
Now, in one level, you know,
listening to it, I'd say, "Well,

00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:42.435 align:middle line:84%
the United States deserves
to lose that position

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:45.405 align:middle line:84%
if we're operating in-- to
that degree of corruption."

00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:49.442 align:middle line:84%
On another level, you're saying,
"Let's fix the corruption

00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
so that we can continue to
remain in that position," right?

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.783 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did we deserve to
remain in that position is--

00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:58.585 align:middle line:84%
that's more of an
ethical argument.

00:16:58.585 --> 00:17:01.421 align:middle line:84%
What was your intention
when you first tried

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.223 align:middle line:84%
to bring this to
their attention?

00:17:03.223 --> 00:17:08.794 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, in 2006 and 2007,
I was in the US Congress,

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:10.129 align:middle line:90%
all over the US Congress.

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:12.365 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations,

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:16.536 align:middle line:84%
that was then shared by Joe
Biden with Hillary Clinton

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.205 align:middle line:84%
and Barack Obama
as junior senators.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:23.176 align:middle line:84%
I went to the senate
Committee on Finance.

00:17:23.176 --> 00:17:28.314 align:middle line:84%
And what was very interesting
was Senator Lugar had a series

00:17:28.314 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:90%
of hearings on this corruption.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the letters that
I wrote to Senator Lugar,

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.221 align:middle line:90%
you can see it on my website,

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:39.826 align:middle line:84%
was I said the German executive
director on the board said

00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:84%
that the board is being treated
like mushrooms, kept in the dark

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.833 align:middle line:90%
and fertilizer put on them.

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:49.435 align:middle line:84%
And that was exactly
what was going

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:51.037 align:middle line:90%
on with the American public.

00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:54.774 align:middle line:84%
In 2007, I knew that the
public needed to know

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
about this corruption to
prevent the United States

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.212 align:middle line:84%
from losing the Gentlemen's
Agreement.

00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:00.747 align:middle line:90%
This is a terrible thing.

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:04.384 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our moral
leadership in front of all

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:06.152 align:middle line:90%
of the countries of the world.

00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:07.654 align:middle line:90%
This is a terrible thing.

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And it could have been prevented
and it wasn't presented

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.792 align:middle line:84%
because this super
entity that I was talking

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:15.562 align:middle line:90%
about owns all of the media.

00:18:15.562 --> 00:18:16.829 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:18.398 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And that was why I
couldn't get my story out.

00:18:18.398 --> 00:18:21.868 align:middle line:84%
So the most important thing
that I think your listeners have

00:18:21.868 --> 00:18:26.005 align:middle line:84%
to consider is everything that
I'm telling you all today,

00:18:26.005 --> 00:18:27.974 align:middle line:84%
why didn't you hear
about it earlier?

00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:29.976 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the dates
of the letters.

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:31.177 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When people
go to your website--

00:18:31.177 --> 00:18:32.278 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: That's right.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.413 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- and start
really digging into it.

00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:36.049 align:middle line:84%
You can see-- you have
chronicled everything

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:38.184 align:middle line:84%
as you said earlier at
the beginning of this.

00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:40.253 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: But also what
happened was,

00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:43.256 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't that the US
Congress was doing nothing.

00:18:43.256 --> 00:18:45.358 align:middle line:90%
The US Congress was asking

00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:49.262 align:middle line:84%
for a government
accountability office inquiry

00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:49.963 align:middle line:90%
into the corruption.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:50.797 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.065 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: That happened in 2008.

00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:57.103 align:middle line:84%
And then, in 2010, I went
to Organizing for America.

00:18:57.103 --> 00:19:00.707 align:middle line:84%
That is the group that
is very closely aligned

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:04.711 align:middle line:84%
with raising funds for the
reelection of Barack Obama.

00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:07.547 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "You will
get bipartisan support

00:19:07.547 --> 00:19:09.382 align:middle line:90%
for fighting this corruption."

00:19:09.382 --> 00:19:13.119 align:middle line:84%
And they went to Senator Lugar
and then they called me back

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:14.687 align:middle line:90%
and said, "Great, Karen.

00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:16.322 align:middle line:90%
Go to Senator Lugar."

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.259 align:middle line:84%
And Senator Lugar
published a paper

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:22.161 align:middle line:84%
which said the government
accountability office has

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.631 align:middle line:84%
withdrawn from the
inquiry into corruption

00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:27.233 align:middle line:84%
because the World
Bank is stonewalling.

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:32.872 align:middle line:84%
This is a very dramatic piece
of information which was kept

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:34.307 align:middle line:90%
from the American public.

00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
When the US lost the ability
to appoint the president

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.813 align:middle line:84%
of the World Bank, this
is a very important piece

00:19:40.813 --> 00:19:43.383 align:middle line:84%
of information that was
kept from the public.

00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So what we are talking about
now is a massive cover up.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you one of
the things that I reported

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.593 align:middle line:84%
to the Congress which
I was very shocked by.

00:19:53.593 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Paul Wolfowitz was
fired by the board

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.267 align:middle line:84%
because he gave an exorbitant
pay raise to his girlfriend

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:03.503 align:middle line:84%
who was working for
the World Bank.

00:20:03.503 --> 00:20:07.874 align:middle line:84%
And I speak Dutch, so I happen
to be in Holland when the man

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:12.445 align:middle line:84%
who was in-charge of firing
Paul Wolfowitz said that all

00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:16.015 align:middle line:84%
of the executive directors
who went to the same house

00:20:16.015 --> 00:20:22.388 align:middle line:84%
of ill repute that Eliot Spitzer
lost his governorship from,

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:25.525 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to intimidate
the board to prevent them

00:20:25.525 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:90%
from firing Paul Wolfowitz.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:32.098 align:middle line:84%
I went back to-- first, I
went to the Senate Committee

00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:34.634 align:middle line:84%
on Foreign Relations
and told Senator Lugar

00:20:34.634 --> 00:20:36.235 align:middle line:90%
about this very shocking thing.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.338 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Go to the
Treasury Department."

00:20:38.338 --> 00:20:39.872 align:middle line:90%
I went to Kenneth Peel.

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:42.742 align:middle line:84%
I ultimately went to the Senate
Committee on Intelligence.

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:46.512 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Europeans are saying
with all of what's going

00:20:46.512 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
on with the NSA spying
on their officials, well,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.655 align:middle line:84%
they started getting very
angry about that back in 2010

00:20:55.655 --> 00:20:57.824 align:middle line:84%
when I first was
report reporting it.

00:20:57.824 --> 00:21:03.296 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that--
the main message I want to get

00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:08.434 align:middle line:84%
out to your listeners
is don't get wild up now

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:10.903 align:middle line:84%
because the news that's
giving you information

00:21:10.903 --> 00:21:13.005 align:middle line:84%
about all these concerning
events,

00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:15.174 align:middle line:84%
they're playing you
all like a piano.

00:21:15.174 --> 00:21:16.342 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:21:16.342 --> 00:21:18.644 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Don't go out and riot.

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:20.012 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.615 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: We don't even demonstrate
because they're provocateurs

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:25.818 align:middle line:84%
and people want them to
be a military take over.

00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:28.721 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of the mater
is I have documented all

00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:31.524 align:middle line:84%
of this information that
I'm telling your listeners

00:21:31.524 --> 00:21:36.362 align:middle line:84%
and where it is right now, it's
with the 10 governors that are

00:21:36.362 --> 00:21:39.499 align:middle line:84%
under an Executive
Order that was issued

00:21:39.499 --> 00:21:42.101 align:middle line:90%
by Barack Obama in 2010.

00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:45.671 align:middle line:84%
They are now liaising with the
Department of Homeland Security.

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:49.742 align:middle line:84%
And I have gone to all of these
officials and I have said,

00:21:49.742 --> 00:21:53.513 align:middle line:84%
"There should be absolutely
no question in the minds

00:21:53.513 --> 00:21:57.617 align:middle line:84%
of the American public whether
there is a government here.

00:21:57.617 --> 00:22:00.186 align:middle line:84%
There is a government here,
where are the governors on this?

00:22:00.186 --> 00:22:02.288 align:middle line:84%
And you have to hold your
governors with them."

00:22:02.288 --> 00:22:04.791 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: OK, now explain who
were they representing?

00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:07.293 align:middle line:84%
What does that group
of people do?

00:22:07.293 --> 00:22:10.897 align:middle line:84%
The governors you just
spoke of in concert

00:22:10.897 --> 00:22:12.565 align:middle line:90%
with Homeland Security you said?

00:22:12.565 --> 00:22:15.601 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: If you read
the Executive Order,

00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:19.071 align:middle line:84%
that is there for
domestic peace.

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:23.109 align:middle line:84%
That is there to intervene
in case of an uprising.

00:22:23.109 --> 00:22:26.512 align:middle line:84%
That's what that committee
was established for.

00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:29.282 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: OK, so now, there
are so many threads here.

00:22:29.282 --> 00:22:32.218 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to a
comment you made earlier.

00:22:32.218 --> 00:22:34.687 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about the
fact that we're sitting

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:37.523 align:middle line:84%
on the precipice of
economic collapse.

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:40.059 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first way to have
insurrection among the public

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:90%
at large, of course.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.529 align:middle line:84%
You start-- you don't have
enough money to survive

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:46.432 align:middle line:84%
because of some kind of
collapse of the currency.

00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:47.733 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have people
in the streets

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:50.436 align:middle line:84%
and everywhere else very,
very upset, we know that.

00:22:50.436 --> 00:22:52.271 align:middle line:84%
You said we're sitting
on the precipice of it

00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:90%
but it's not going to happen.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.208 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: That's right.

00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:59.111 align:middle line:84%
Because all of the governors
are going to follow the example

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:03.349 align:middle line:84%
of the lead states which
have declared that gold

00:23:03.349 --> 00:23:05.218 align:middle line:90%
and silver is legal tender.

00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:08.054 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: OK, so that's where this
piece of the story comes in.

00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, when all this was coming
down, you told me off camera,

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:84%
you started metal
straighters coming to you.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.597 align:middle line:84%
So, basically looking at
the market, the situation,

00:23:17.597 --> 00:23:20.500 align:middle line:84%
the devaluation of the dollar,
why were they coming to you

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.934 align:middle line:90%
and what was your role in this?

00:23:21.934 --> 00:23:23.836 align:middle line:90%
What were you telling them?

00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:27.173 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, they knew that I
had bought a World Bank bond

00:23:27.173 --> 00:23:30.243 align:middle line:84%
and that I had sued the World
Bank and the World Bank--

00:23:30.243 --> 00:23:31.477 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: As a bond holder?

00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: -- auditors, because
if you're a bond holder,

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:84%
then the World Bank
has no immunity.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.486 align:middle line:84%
And I had all of
this data showing

00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
that the financial
information that was going

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.294 align:middle line:84%
to the public was not
accurate, was not reliable

00:23:48.294 --> 00:23:50.496 align:middle line:84%
because whistleblowers
were getting fired.

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:51.264 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:23:51.264 --> 00:23:52.398 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Anybody that tried

00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:54.467 align:middle line:84%
to correct inaccurate
financial information.

00:23:54.467 --> 00:23:59.405 align:middle line:84%
Not just me but a whole
slew of whistleblowers.

00:23:59.405 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Accountants were reporting

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.411 align:middle line:84%
that the borrowers were being
overcharged their interest.

00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:08.381 align:middle line:84%
There were all kinds
of shenanigans going

00:24:08.381 --> 00:24:13.686 align:middle line:84%
on because this group, this
super entity felt that it was

00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:16.689 align:middle line:84%
so powerful and it had
control of the media

00:24:16.689 --> 00:24:19.392 align:middle line:90%
so it could act with impunity.

00:24:19.392 --> 00:24:21.827 align:middle line:90%
And it did act with impunity.

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:26.465 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't count of the
fact that we, whistleblowers,

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:29.769 align:middle line:84%
were going to enlist our
governments and we were going

00:24:29.769 --> 00:24:33.806 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that all
of the dire consequences

00:24:33.806 --> 00:24:38.544 align:middle line:84%
that this super entity is trying
to achieve would not happen.

00:24:38.544 --> 00:24:41.581 align:middle line:84%
And so, the governors
are going to make sure

00:24:41.581 --> 00:24:47.286 align:middle line:84%
that we do not have a currency
where no one has any confidence.

00:24:47.286 --> 00:24:48.988 align:middle line:84%
They will-- we don't
have to replace--

00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:50.823 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So basically we're
going to the states.

00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:53.059 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the states are really
going to have to implement

00:24:53.059 --> 00:24:55.061 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of the people.

00:24:55.061 --> 00:24:57.363 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Not just the states,
the counties as well.

00:24:57.363 --> 00:24:58.698 align:middle line:90%
We've gone to the counties.

00:24:58.698 --> 00:24:59.865 align:middle line:90%
And when I say we--

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:01.467 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: OK, so it's getting
more and more local.

00:25:01.467 --> 00:25:04.637 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're looking at
essentially surviving any kind

00:25:04.637 --> 00:25:07.673 align:middle line:84%
of devaluation of the dollar,
you're saying A, it won't happen

00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:08.774 align:middle line:90%
that way to begin with,

00:25:08.774 --> 00:25:10.076 align:middle line:84%
that they're not going
to let it collapse.

00:25:10.076 --> 00:25:12.144 align:middle line:84%
But it's really now
falling into the hands

00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:14.513 align:middle line:90%
of the counties and the states.

00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.849 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And the public,
to make sure

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:21.887 align:middle line:84%
that their officials do
their job before we lose the

00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:23.589 align:middle line:90%
credibility of the dollar.

00:25:23.589 --> 00:25:24.957 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:26.325 align:middle line:84%
Well, that seems like we're
just sitting right on the edge

00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:27.927 align:middle line:84%
of that, it's been
threatening for over a year.

00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:29.128 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: We can take steps.

00:25:29.128 --> 00:25:31.063 align:middle line:84%
We can take steps to
prevent this from happening

00:25:31.063 --> 00:25:34.533 align:middle line:84%
and we are taking steps to
prevent this from happening.

00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:38.237 align:middle line:84%
And if your listeners
demand information

00:25:38.237 --> 00:25:40.806 align:middle line:84%
from their officials,
they can get the ones

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:42.174 align:middle line:90%
that aren't moving on this--

00:25:42.174 --> 00:25:42.808 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:25:42.808 --> 00:25:43.743 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: -- to move.

00:25:43.743 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.544 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.846 align:middle line:84%
So I have a couple
questions here.

00:25:46.846 --> 00:25:48.981 align:middle line:84%
One, I want to go in to
the piece you just kind

00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:53.586 align:middle line:84%
of you mentioned briefly which
is going to a metals-backed,

00:25:53.586 --> 00:25:56.422 align:middle line:90%
gold-backed currency again.

00:25:56.422 --> 00:26:00.126 align:middle line:84%
The other one is a little
higher up the chain.

00:26:00.126 --> 00:26:03.829 align:middle line:84%
What is the relationship between
the Federal Reserve super

00:26:03.829 --> 00:26:07.066 align:middle line:84%
entities and the
IMF and World Bank?

00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:10.569 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one is created in '33
the other is created in '44.

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.471 align:middle line:84%
What is the relationship
between the two?

00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:14.607 align:middle line:90%
Is one being run by the other?

00:26:14.607 --> 00:26:17.443 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, there is
what you have on paper

00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:20.079 align:middle line:84%
and then there's what
you have in practice.

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:21.147 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:26:21.147 --> 00:26:21.747 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
happens in practice.

00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:22.982 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: OK.

00:26:22.982 --> 00:26:24.016 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me start out
though with what's on paper.

00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:25.051 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:26.886 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Because the
fed does had a role.

00:26:26.886 --> 00:26:29.121 align:middle line:84%
There's something called the
National Advisory Council

00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:32.091 align:middle line:84%
which is chaired by the
Secretary of the Treasury

00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.693 align:middle line:90%
but it has the chairman

00:26:33.693 --> 00:26:36.562 align:middle line:84%
of the Federal Reserve
Board on it, Ben Bernanke.

00:26:36.562 --> 00:26:39.165 align:middle line:84%
And I've been writing that
group, it has the Secretary

00:26:39.165 --> 00:26:41.867 align:middle line:84%
of State, it has the chairman
of the Export-Import Bank,

00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:45.438 align:middle line:84%
it has all the Commerce
Department,

00:26:45.438 --> 00:26:47.073 align:middle line:84%
the Special Trade
Representative.

00:26:47.073 --> 00:26:51.744 align:middle line:84%
All of the departments in the
US government that have a role

00:26:51.744 --> 00:26:54.213 align:middle line:84%
to play in international
trade are

00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:55.681 align:middle line:84%
on the National Advisory
Council.

00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So I had written
these officials--

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.818 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:26:58.818 --> 00:27:00.119 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: -- to find out what
they're planning on doing.

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.691 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And so, I got in
touch with the Office

00:27:05.691 --> 00:27:08.961 align:middle line:84%
of the Inspector General in
the Federal Reserve Board

00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "What is
Chairman Bernanke doing

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.833 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of this crisis?"

00:27:13.833 --> 00:27:15.401 align:middle line:90%
And I got a letter back saying

00:27:15.401 --> 00:27:18.104 align:middle line:84%
that Chairman Bernanke
had nothing whatsoever

00:27:18.104 --> 00:27:19.405 align:middle line:90%
to do with it.

00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote them back and I
said, "We'll wait a minute.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.975 align:middle line:90%
No, he doesn't get off the hook.

00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:25.578 align:middle line:84%
I've been writing him
for years on this."

00:27:25.578 --> 00:27:29.381 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact, the
very last letter that I wrote,

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:34.019 align:middle line:84%
I said, "If you don't answer me,
I am sending this very letter

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:37.823 align:middle line:84%
to all of the ambassadors
of the 188 countries.

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:39.959 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget the
board knows me very well

00:27:39.959 --> 00:27:45.464 align:middle line:84%
because I had been there for
20 years and they also know me

00:27:45.464 --> 00:27:49.301 align:middle line:84%
as the person who went to
the US Congress to report

00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:51.303 align:middle line:84%
about how they were
getting blackmailed."

00:27:51.303 --> 00:27:51.837 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:52.805 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:27:52.805 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was locked
down at the building

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.978 align:middle line:90%
in 2000-- I guess it was 2009.

00:27:58.978 --> 00:28:01.447 align:middle line:84%
Because what I was
doing there was I said,

00:28:01.447 --> 00:28:04.183 align:middle line:84%
"All of this corruption
has gotten to the point

00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:08.454 align:middle line:84%
where we have to end a
convention," is what it is.

00:28:08.454 --> 00:28:11.824 align:middle line:84%
There was something which
early in the very beginning

00:28:11.824 --> 00:28:18.230 align:middle line:84%
in 1944 there was a
convention that the president

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.367 align:middle line:84%
of the World Bank
could propose anything

00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:26.772 align:middle line:84%
and the board would wait
and vote up or down.

00:28:26.772 --> 00:28:28.941 align:middle line:90%
And this is just a convention.

00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:32.912 align:middle line:84%
They can say, "Well, there's too
much corruption and we are going

00:28:32.912 --> 00:28:35.681 align:middle line:84%
to follow all of the
powers of the board

00:28:35.681 --> 00:28:37.216 align:middle line:90%
that are in the articles."

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:38.317 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Yes.

00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:40.286 align:middle line:84%
This is-- it's time
for you to do that."

00:28:40.286 --> 00:28:44.089 align:middle line:84%
And right after I did that, I
was locked out of the building.

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:46.892 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I had also
been interviewed for the job

00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:48.761 align:middle line:90%
of general counsel and I was--

00:28:48.761 --> 00:28:49.562 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: For the World Bank?

00:28:49.562 --> 00:28:50.396 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: For the World Bank.

00:28:50.396 --> 00:28:52.398 align:middle line:90%
And I was asked the question,

00:28:52.398 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:84%
why is there such
a high turnover?

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.772 align:middle line:84%
Why do you have to have another
general counsel every year

00:28:59.772 --> 00:29:00.539 align:middle line:90%
or two?

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:01.407 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very good question.

00:29:01.407 --> 00:29:02.608 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:05.211 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the answer
because one of the people

00:29:05.211 --> 00:29:08.614 align:middle line:84%
at that conference in
1944 was a young lawyer,

00:29:08.614 --> 00:29:10.883 align:middle line:84%
Dutch lawyer named
Aaron Broches.

00:29:10.883 --> 00:29:14.086 align:middle line:84%
And I got to know him
because I wanted to find

00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:16.622 align:middle line:90%
out what the real story is,

00:29:16.622 --> 00:29:19.592 align:middle line:84%
not just what the World
Bank is like on paper.

00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:20.826 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:29:20.826 --> 00:29:21.894 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And he was a general
counsel for how long?

00:29:21.894 --> 00:29:23.662 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: The longest
serving general counsel.

00:29:23.662 --> 00:29:26.031 align:middle line:84%
He was there for 20
years as general counsel.

00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:27.233 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:29:27.233 --> 00:29:29.268 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And he said that
when Robert McNamara came

00:29:29.268 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:90%
to the World Bank in 1968,

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.607 align:middle line:84%
that's when the World Bank
started going really corrupt.

00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:38.811 align:middle line:84%
It's-- the general counsel is
really the most important job

00:29:38.811 --> 00:29:41.947 align:middle line:84%
in the World Bank because
if you have the president

00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:43.849 align:middle line:90%
who is ignoring the board,

00:29:43.849 --> 00:29:46.452 align:middle line:84%
if you have a good general
counsel they won't let

00:29:46.452 --> 00:29:47.686 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:29:47.686 --> 00:29:50.522 align:middle line:84%
Or as what I did when I went
to the board and I said,

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:84%
"It is time now, not to sit
back and wait for the president

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.861 align:middle line:90%
to propose something."

00:29:55.861 --> 00:29:58.264 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is that
president proposing?

00:29:58.264 --> 00:30:01.133 align:middle line:84%
He is there as a puppet
of the super entity.

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:02.067 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:04.937 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: That's what
the reality is.

00:30:04.937 --> 00:30:06.972 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So you learned
from this man

00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:08.307 align:middle line:84%
that you were just
speaking about?

00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:11.577 align:middle line:84%
That just that-- is that what
he taught you in essence?

00:30:11.577 --> 00:30:12.711 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:30:12.711 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You are not
there to be a puppet.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.583 align:middle line:84%
You are there to be a
lawyer, to have rule of law."

00:30:17.583 --> 00:30:18.717 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: To uphold
the rule of law.

00:30:18.717 --> 00:30:20.085 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: To uphold
the rule of law.

00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:23.722 align:middle line:84%
And as you saw, the
World Bank was created

00:30:23.722 --> 00:30:25.591 align:middle line:90%
to prevent World War III.

00:30:25.591 --> 00:30:26.992 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: If the lawyer is sitting
there and following the rules,

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.565 align:middle line:90%
you don't have World War III.

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:34.266 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:30:34.266 --> 00:30:35.567 align:middle line:90%
It's just very simple.

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:37.703 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But going
back to the point

00:30:37.703 --> 00:30:41.106 align:middle line:84%
that these general counsels
were disappearing basically

00:30:41.106 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
at the rate of one a year, is
it because they were attempting

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.713 align:middle line:84%
to impose the rule
of law and going

00:30:47.713 --> 00:30:50.249 align:middle line:90%
up against the puppet masters?

00:30:50.249 --> 00:30:51.483 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: No.

00:30:51.483 --> 00:30:53.485 align:middle line:84%
No. What they were doing
was they were getting fired

00:30:53.485 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:90%
by the board.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.354 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, they're being fired.

00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:56.488 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:58.324 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And then there
was a special inquiry.

00:30:58.324 --> 00:31:02.227 align:middle line:90%
And the United States tried

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:05.331 align:middle line:84%
to have the board removed
from the World Bank.

00:31:05.331 --> 00:31:07.066 align:middle line:90%
There was a commission.

00:31:07.066 --> 00:31:10.769 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the board
wasn't going to do that.

00:31:10.769 --> 00:31:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:12.604 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Germany resigned
from commission.

00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:14.239 align:middle line:90%
It was just an embarrassment.

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:15.607 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:18.978 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, now, let's
go back 'cause it's--

00:31:18.978 --> 00:31:21.747 align:middle line:84%
I was a little nervous about
talking to you honestly

00:31:21.747 --> 00:31:25.284 align:middle line:84%
because this is a story that
really requires 10 or 15 hours

00:31:25.284 --> 00:31:28.654 align:middle line:84%
to tell and we're trying to keep
it as streamlined and simple

00:31:28.654 --> 00:31:32.825 align:middle line:84%
as possible but it's hard to
do because without bringing

00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:36.195 align:middle line:84%
in tangential information,
other parts don't make sense.

00:31:36.195 --> 00:31:40.232 align:middle line:84%
So, saying that right here,
we have to jump back now,

00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that I want to get
back to what you said.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways of avoiding
the currency collapse is

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.806 align:middle line:84%
by through these governors that
are on this-- it's not a board.

00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:48.874 align:middle line:84%
What did you say
the name of that?

00:31:48.874 --> 00:31:50.542 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, there
are two levels.

00:31:50.542 --> 00:31:51.744 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:31:51.744 --> 00:31:52.478 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: There is the Board
of Executive Directors.

00:31:52.478 --> 00:31:53.245 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:31:53.245 --> 00:31:54.513 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: There's 25 of them

00:31:54.513 --> 00:31:58.384 align:middle line:84%
and the seven largest countries
have their own dedicated

00:31:58.384 --> 00:31:59.685 align:middle line:90%
executive directors.

00:31:59.685 --> 00:32:00.953 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:32:00.953 --> 00:32:03.389 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: So there's the US,
Britain, France, Germany,

00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:07.292 align:middle line:90%
China, Saudi Arabia, Japan.

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the countries
share an executive director.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.232 align:middle line:90%
They all work together--

00:32:13.232 --> 00:32:14.333 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:15.267 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: -- to share an
executive director.

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:16.969 align:middle line:90%
And that group is resident.

00:32:16.969 --> 00:32:18.137 align:middle line:90%
They are there all the time.

00:32:18.137 --> 00:32:19.338 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:32:19.338 --> 00:32:22.341 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And then, you have
all 188 countries come

00:32:22.341 --> 00:32:24.376 align:middle line:90%
to the World Bank every--

00:32:24.376 --> 00:32:28.247 align:middle line:84%
twice a year and they
discuss what's going on.

00:32:28.247 --> 00:32:30.516 align:middle line:84%
And then, in between
those times,

00:32:30.516 --> 00:32:34.386 align:middle line:84%
there is something called the
Development Committee which acts

00:32:34.386 --> 00:32:40.426 align:middle line:84%
to safeguard the interest
of the 188 countries.

00:32:40.426 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.995 align:middle line:84%
So they're part of the
Development Committee.

00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:46.432 align:middle line:84%
And now, you just teased us
a little bit with a notion

00:32:46.432 --> 00:32:48.434 align:middle line:84%
of going back to
the metals-backed

00:32:48.434 --> 00:32:52.771 align:middle line:84%
or asset-backed currency of
some kind in five of the states.

00:32:52.771 --> 00:32:53.972 align:middle line:90%
I think it's five.

00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Is it four, five, or six
of the states in the US--

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.442 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, I know
that there are 12

00:32:56.442 --> 00:32:57.843 align:middle line:84%
that are considering
legislation--

00:32:57.843 --> 00:32:59.545 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I think five have
already done it, haven't they?

00:32:59.545 --> 00:33:01.046 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: And there may be more.

00:33:01.046 --> 00:33:05.117 align:middle line:84%
What I did on Friday was I
asked a couple of the governors.

00:33:05.117 --> 00:33:06.185 align:middle line:90%
I called them up.

00:33:06.185 --> 00:33:07.419 align:middle line:90%
They called me up.

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:10.756 align:middle line:84%
I asked a couple of the
governors who are concerned

00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:13.959 align:middle line:84%
about this very serious
problem to try

00:33:13.959 --> 00:33:15.894 align:middle line:90%
to convene the other governors.

00:33:15.894 --> 00:33:19.631 align:middle line:84%
And we have experts, world
experts, who can explain

00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:21.300 align:middle line:90%
to them why this is necessary.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.735 align:middle line:84%
We can explain this
to the citizens

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:28.307 align:middle line:84%
who can also make their counties
and governors responsive

00:33:28.307 --> 00:33:30.709 align:middle line:84%
because we do have the
time to solve the problem.

00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:33.178 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And demanding that we
move away from fiat currency

00:33:33.178 --> 00:33:34.580 align:middle line:90%
to an asset-backed currency?

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.482 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And we can do
it in a very smooth way

00:33:36.482 --> 00:33:39.485 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't have to be
entirely precious metals.

00:33:39.485 --> 00:33:41.453 align:middle line:90%
There is room for other--

00:33:41.453 --> 00:33:42.521 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Other assets.

00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:44.089 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: -- other assets,
other commodities.

00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:45.824 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:33:45.824 --> 00:33:48.393 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: So, all that has
to happen is we have

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:52.431 align:middle line:84%
to break the logjam
of lack of information

00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:55.334 align:middle line:84%
because the media
is all controlled

00:33:55.334 --> 00:33:57.035 align:middle line:90%
by this super entities.

00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:58.403 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense at all.

00:33:58.403 --> 00:33:59.605 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No, it doesn't.

00:33:59.605 --> 00:34:01.807 align:middle line:84%
I mean, only from their
point of view of course.

00:34:01.807 --> 00:34:02.808 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:34:02.808 --> 00:34:03.976 align:middle line:84%
That's where it makes
a lot of sense.

00:34:03.976 --> 00:34:05.377 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That makes a lot--
makes perfect sense.

00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:09.814 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking now at those
markets, now, the same entities,

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
at least from what I read
and concess [phonetic]

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:16.988 align:middle line:84%
of the situation, those same
super entities also control the

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:20.225 align:middle line:90%
prices on those metals markets.

00:34:20.225 --> 00:34:22.827 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: They have not
only controlled them,

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:25.831 align:middle line:90%
they manipulate them illegally.

00:34:25.831 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So how you--
and so if you have

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:31.303 align:middle line:84%
that as a manipulated market,
and that's what we need to kind

00:34:31.303 --> 00:34:35.474 align:middle line:84%
of turn to in order to have some
kind of asset-backed currency--

00:34:35.474 --> 00:34:35.974 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: No.

00:34:35.974 --> 00:34:36.742 align:middle line:90%
No. No.

00:34:36.742 --> 00:34:37.242 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: How does this work?

00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:38.577 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: OK.

00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:41.680 align:middle line:84%
What happened was they only
got away with it for so long

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.649 align:middle line:90%
until people understood

00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:46.185 align:middle line:84%
that they were trying
to fool everybody.

00:34:46.185 --> 00:34:47.186 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:34:47.186 --> 00:34:48.353 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And it doesn't
work anymore.

00:34:48.353 --> 00:34:51.990 align:middle line:84%
The people are running
out to buy gold--

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:53.025 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, yeah like crazy.

00:34:53.025 --> 00:34:54.193 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: -- to hoard it.

00:34:54.193 --> 00:34:55.327 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And silver.

00:34:55.327 --> 00:34:56.061 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:56.795 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Palladium.

00:34:56.795 --> 00:34:57.996 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:34:57.996 --> 00:35:02.267 align:middle line:84%
So, what the super entity
was doing was they were

00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:03.569 align:middle line:90%
leasing gold.

00:35:03.569 --> 00:35:05.704 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't lease
gold anymore.

00:35:05.704 --> 00:35:07.973 align:middle line:90%
It's stopped in July.

00:35:07.973 --> 00:35:13.212 align:middle line:84%
The price of the lease-- the 7th
of July got to be so expensive

00:35:13.212 --> 00:35:16.181 align:middle line:84%
that nobody was going to
lease their gold anymore.

00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:18.917 align:middle line:84%
They were also afraid that
they wouldn't get the gold back

00:35:18.917 --> 00:35:20.185 align:middle line:90%
at the end all of these.

00:35:20.185 --> 00:35:22.554 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Tell us about
gold leasing?

00:35:22.554 --> 00:35:23.488 align:middle line:90%
Who's involved?

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:24.523 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:35:24.523 --> 00:35:26.024 align:middle line:90%
Who benefits?

00:35:26.024 --> 00:35:27.392 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what that means.

00:35:27.392 --> 00:35:30.128 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: What it is, that's the
reason that you have the fed

00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:31.630 align:middle line:90%
and the central banks.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:36.368 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
that kind of power,

00:35:36.368 --> 00:35:40.739 align:middle line:84%
you can take real
gold and lease it.

00:35:40.739 --> 00:35:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And then the company that is
leasing the gold gets to count

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:49.181 align:middle line:84%
that as their gold and the
company who is the lessor

00:35:49.181 --> 00:35:52.284 align:middle line:84%
of the gold, that's
saying one piece of--

00:35:52.284 --> 00:35:56.655 align:middle line:84%
one ton of gold exists
in two places.

00:35:56.655 --> 00:35:57.489 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:35:57.489 --> 00:35:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Well, that's impossible.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.191 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:00.259 align:middle line:90%
So that-- you're saying

00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:02.227 align:middle line:84%
that practice has
stopped as of July 7th?

00:36:02.227 --> 00:36:03.428 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: It has stopped it.

00:36:03.428 --> 00:36:06.932 align:middle line:84%
It has stopped because the
people who are leasing,

00:36:06.932 --> 00:36:09.835 align:middle line:84%
who are calculating
the price of the lease,

00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:11.937 align:middle line:84%
are taking the risk
that they will not--

00:36:11.937 --> 00:36:13.171 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Sure.

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.306 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: -- get the gold back
at the end of the lease.

00:36:14.306 --> 00:36:17.142 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So what are the
ramifications globally

00:36:17.142 --> 00:36:20.545 align:middle line:90%
of stopping this practice?

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:24.683 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: The ramifications are the
people understand even though

00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:29.187 align:middle line:84%
the super entity is writing
articles to try to explain this.

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:33.759 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in Bloomberg,
there was an article trying

00:36:33.759 --> 00:36:38.096 align:middle line:84%
to give a good explanation for
why it doesn't really matter

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:40.332 align:middle line:84%
when there's no more
leasing of gold.

00:36:40.332 --> 00:36:42.701 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote a comment, I said,

00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:44.936 align:middle line:84%
"This is putting
leotards on a pig."

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:47.406 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:36:47.406 --> 00:36:51.276 align:middle line:84%
And then I described about
how I had had this problem

00:36:51.276 --> 00:36:54.446 align:middle line:84%
with the Department of Justice
trying to throw me in jail

00:36:54.446 --> 00:36:57.883 align:middle line:84%
when 188 Ministers of
Finance, they want me back

00:36:57.883 --> 00:37:00.686 align:middle line:84%
at the World Bank so we
can sit down and sort

00:37:00.686 --> 00:37:04.056 align:middle line:84%
out these problems while
there is still time.

00:37:04.056 --> 00:37:05.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:06.458 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:08.894 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And they know, I-- you
know, I send them the emails

00:37:08.894 --> 00:37:10.629 align:middle line:84%
that I'm sending
to the governors.

00:37:10.629 --> 00:37:11.730 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "You know,

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.832 align:middle line:84%
the governors are taking
you very seriously.

00:37:13.832 --> 00:37:17.169 align:middle line:84%
We're not in that dire
straits, and I'm getting

00:37:17.169 --> 00:37:19.004 align:middle line:90%
through to the American public.

00:37:19.004 --> 00:37:23.542 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually sit down and
come up with the transition,

00:37:23.542 --> 00:37:25.410 align:middle line:84%
so that the Bretton
Woods Institutions

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:29.481 align:middle line:84%
that we were just seeing
actually achieved their purpose

00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:31.917 align:middle line:90%
of preventing World War III."

00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:35.087 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, part of it is, as
I will ask-- you had mentioned,

00:37:35.087 --> 00:37:37.155 align:middle line:84%
the stabilization of
global currencies.

00:37:37.155 --> 00:37:39.858 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking about
the US currency right now.

00:37:39.858 --> 00:37:41.360 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about the dollar.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.896 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, there are
means by which we could keep it

00:37:44.896 --> 00:37:47.399 align:middle line:84%
from totally collapsing
but let's look at some

00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:49.735 align:middle line:84%
of other currencies around
the world and what's happened

00:37:49.735 --> 00:37:51.136 align:middle line:90%
in some other regions.

00:37:51.136 --> 00:37:54.706 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was it completely not
foreseen that this would happen

00:37:54.706 --> 00:37:56.541 align:middle line:84%
in Cyprus, Spain,
Italy, et cetera?

00:37:56.541 --> 00:37:59.344 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was this-- this
was a surprise to everyone,

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:02.381 align:middle line:84%
the media acts like,
"Oh, what a surprise.

00:38:02.381 --> 00:38:04.549 align:middle line:90%
We had no idea."

00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:06.051 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:38:06.051 --> 00:38:09.021 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: OK, let me tell you
about another whistleblower.

00:38:09.021 --> 00:38:10.021 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:11.456 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Do you remember
what happened

00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:15.761 align:middle line:84%
with the US Postal Service
where we said that we had

00:38:15.761 --> 00:38:17.496 align:middle line:90%
to tighten their belts because--

00:38:17.496 --> 00:38:18.597 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:38:18.597 --> 00:38:20.599 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: The reason why
is because they have

00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:23.135 align:middle line:84%
to prefund all of
their pensions.

00:38:23.135 --> 00:38:25.237 align:middle line:90%
This is an accounting rule.

00:38:25.237 --> 00:38:29.908 align:middle line:84%
And then, the bankers
go out and raised funds

00:38:29.908 --> 00:38:32.310 align:middle line:84%
on the capital markets
to finance--

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.712 align:middle line:90%
to prefund the pensions.

00:38:33.712 --> 00:38:37.783 align:middle line:84%
Now, these postal workers aren't
going to be retiring next year.

00:38:37.783 --> 00:38:39.184 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:38:39.184 --> 00:38:41.486 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Why should all of that
money be sitting there liquid?

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:43.054 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: For retirement
upfront, yes.

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:43.588 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Exactly.

00:38:43.588 --> 00:38:44.656 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:45.557 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Why are you
financing this upfront?

00:38:45.557 --> 00:38:46.691 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:48.994 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: The reason why
is it's a very lucrative

00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:52.497 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same thing for
municipal financing or Detroit

00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:53.799 align:middle line:90%
or any of these things.

00:38:53.799 --> 00:38:57.335 align:middle line:84%
It's very lucrative practice
for these banks to go out.

00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:59.871 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same thing--
no, I'm not saying

00:38:59.871 --> 00:39:02.340 align:middle line:84%
that Cyprus doesn't
have a financial problem

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.811 align:middle line:84%
but I'm saying the
answer is not immediately

00:39:05.811 --> 00:39:07.579 align:middle line:90%
to turn to austerity.

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:11.349 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Not only that, pilfering
the accounts of the depositors.

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.751 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:39:12.751 --> 00:39:17.122 align:middle line:84%
This is a solution that
makes sense if you're one

00:39:17.122 --> 00:39:20.792 align:middle line:84%
of the super entity and
makes no sense if you're one

00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:22.394 align:middle line:90%
of the people living in any

00:39:22.394 --> 00:39:24.629 align:middle line:84%
of these countries that's
going into austerity.

00:39:24.629 --> 00:39:29.935 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have to have
a very serious conversation

00:39:29.935 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:90%
about what the conventions are.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:34.139 align:middle line:84%
Because the point is,
if you're not prefund--

00:39:34.139 --> 00:39:35.273 align:middle line:84%
let's go back to
what we were talking

00:39:35.273 --> 00:39:37.375 align:middle line:84%
about with prefunding
the pensions.

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:40.579 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have to prefund
all of these pensions,

00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:44.316 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have to tax
people to pay the debt,

00:39:44.316 --> 00:39:47.419 align:middle line:84%
the interest on these
bonds that you're issuing.

00:39:47.419 --> 00:39:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.956 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, if the money
stays with the people,

00:39:50.956 --> 00:39:52.591 align:middle line:90%
they buy goods and services.

00:39:52.591 --> 00:39:54.559 align:middle line:90%
The economy grows.

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:55.894 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a depression.

00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:57.562 align:middle line:90%
This is a way to get more jobs.

00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:58.163 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Keeping this circulating.

00:39:58.163 --> 00:39:58.697 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Exactly.

00:39:58.697 --> 00:39:59.831 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:02.767 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: This is a way to
keep more jobs instead

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:05.737 align:middle line:84%
of keep more profits
in Wall Street.

00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:09.341 align:middle line:84%
So we need to have a
monetary conference

00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:11.276 align:middle line:84%
in the Bretton Woods
Institutions

00:40:11.276 --> 00:40:13.445 align:middle line:84%
and anywhere else
that makes sense.

00:40:13.445 --> 00:40:17.983 align:middle line:84%
But, first of all, all of
the people who are thinking

00:40:17.983 --> 00:40:22.087 align:middle line:84%
that they can just relax and let
the experts take care of things,

00:40:22.087 --> 00:40:24.789 align:middle line:84%
no, they need to
inform themselves.

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:29.060 align:middle line:84%
There's something that they
call a democratic deficit.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Your Secretary of the
Treasury is going to all

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.566 align:middle line:84%
of these meetings and
speaking on your behalf.

00:40:34.566 --> 00:40:36.401 align:middle line:84%
What do you know about
what he's saying?

00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:39.170 align:middle line:84%
What do you know about
what the conventions are?

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.239 align:middle line:90%
You need to inform yourself.

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:43.308 align:middle line:90%
You need to be involved.

00:40:43.308 --> 00:40:46.011 align:middle line:84%
You need to support the
people who are trying

00:40:46.011 --> 00:40:49.614 align:middle line:84%
to get this situation
regularized

00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:53.552 align:middle line:84%
so that the shots are not being
called by this super entity.

00:40:53.552 --> 00:40:54.853 align:middle line:90%
Who elected them?

00:40:54.853 --> 00:40:58.056 align:middle line:84%
Nobody. Why should they deny
information to the public?

00:40:58.056 --> 00:40:59.324 align:middle line:90%
They shouldn't.

00:40:59.324 --> 00:41:01.293 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:41:01.293 --> 00:41:02.727 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:41:02.727 --> 00:41:04.296 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we talked about at the
beginning this conversation,

00:41:04.296 --> 00:41:07.032 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult for people
to know who they can trust

00:41:07.032 --> 00:41:08.133 align:middle line:90%
with information anymore.

00:41:08.133 --> 00:41:09.734 align:middle line:90%
That's really a big one.

00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:13.572 align:middle line:84%
So when you have the super
entities creating media outlets

00:41:13.572 --> 00:41:16.875 align:middle line:84%
that are posing as alternative
media outlets for example,

00:41:16.875 --> 00:41:18.743 align:middle line:90%
this makes it even cloudier.

00:41:18.743 --> 00:41:20.946 align:middle line:84%
People almost have to go
to a crystal ball to figure

00:41:20.946 --> 00:41:23.548 align:middle line:84%
out who they can trust
and listen to any longer.

00:41:23.548 --> 00:41:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, what they
need to do is talk

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.918 align:middle line:90%
to their next door neighbor--

00:41:26.918 --> 00:41:27.752 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:41:27.752 --> 00:41:29.154 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: -- and do a study group.

00:41:29.154 --> 00:41:30.622 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That is very true.

00:41:30.622 --> 00:41:31.823 align:middle line:90%
Taking it to the streets

00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:34.392 align:middle line:84%
and taking responsibility
ourselves as you said.

00:41:34.392 --> 00:41:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, there is a group

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.163 align:middle line:84%
of countries taking
responsibility themselves.

00:41:38.163 --> 00:41:40.031 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the BRIC countries.

00:41:40.031 --> 00:41:42.534 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what's happening

00:41:42.534 --> 00:41:49.207 align:middle line:84%
between the super entity-- super
entities and the BRIC countries,

00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:53.311 align:middle line:84%
and why the BRIC countries, and
please talk about who they are,

00:41:53.311 --> 00:41:55.814 align:middle line:84%
why they're-- each one of
these countries is involved,

00:41:55.814 --> 00:41:58.817 align:middle line:90%
what they're attempting to do.

00:41:58.817 --> 00:42:03.588 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: That's Brazil, Russia,
India, China, and South Africa.

00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:06.191 align:middle line:84%
And these countries,
if you add up the trade

00:42:06.191 --> 00:42:10.495 align:middle line:84%
that they have among
themselves, that's 25 percent

00:42:10.495 --> 00:42:12.731 align:middle line:90%
of international trade.

00:42:12.731 --> 00:42:17.802 align:middle line:84%
So what this means is the
dollar has been the currency

00:42:17.802 --> 00:42:19.404 align:middle line:90%
for international trade.

00:42:19.404 --> 00:42:21.906 align:middle line:84%
We have been financing
all of the trade

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.275 align:middle line:90%
between these countries.

00:42:23.275 --> 00:42:25.744 align:middle line:84%
They said, "You know, I
think we've had enough

00:42:25.744 --> 00:42:28.313 align:middle line:84%
of the corruption of
this super entity.

00:42:28.313 --> 00:42:32.951 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we find a different
system for financing our trade?"

00:42:32.951 --> 00:42:36.421 align:middle line:84%
And so, at the last
spring meeting just before

00:42:36.421 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:84%
that in April, they
announced that they were going

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.492 align:middle line:84%
to setup their own
development bank.

00:42:40.492 --> 00:42:43.828 align:middle line:84%
And what they're going to do
is they are going to add up,

00:42:43.828 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:90%
they're going to use barter.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:49.768 align:middle line:84%
They're going to add up who's
got a positive trade balance.

00:42:49.768 --> 00:42:52.237 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
finance that with gold

00:42:52.237 --> 00:42:57.108 align:middle line:84%
and then they're going to take
the dollars that they have got,

00:42:57.108 --> 00:43:00.745 align:middle line:84%
surplus dollars that they don't
want anymore, and they're going

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:02.747 align:middle line:84%
to lend them out through
this development bank.

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:06.985 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way for them to get
rid of all of these surplus--

00:43:06.985 --> 00:43:09.788 align:middle line:84%
and where are these extra
dollars coming from?

00:43:09.788 --> 00:43:12.590 align:middle line:84%
They're coming from something
called quantitative easing.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.658 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:43:13.658 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Every month,
we've got, you know,

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:20.031 align:middle line:84%
printing press going
with paper currency.

00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:22.667 align:middle line:90%
Now, people aren't-- the demand

00:43:22.667 --> 00:43:26.538 align:middle line:84%
for the dollars is not
meeting the supply.

00:43:26.538 --> 00:43:28.573 align:middle line:90%
There is a surplus there.

00:43:28.573 --> 00:43:30.508 align:middle line:90%
And pretty soon, you're going

00:43:30.508 --> 00:43:34.312 align:middle line:84%
to risk the people will
not view these dollars as--

00:43:34.312 --> 00:43:35.246 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: As having value.

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:35.814 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:43:35.814 --> 00:43:36.648 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Exactly.

00:43:36.648 --> 00:43:39.351 align:middle line:90%
And so we have got to find us--

00:43:39.351 --> 00:43:44.122 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to be no
more dollars but we have

00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:48.493 align:middle line:84%
to find a smooth
transition to replace this--

00:43:48.493 --> 00:43:50.061 align:middle line:90%
they call it fiat currency.

00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:50.929 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:43:50.929 --> 00:43:53.264 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: It's used
to be until 1971

00:43:53.264 --> 00:43:55.867 align:middle line:84%
that you could take a
dollar and you could go

00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:59.204 align:middle line:84%
to the Federal Reserve and
you would get the dollar's

00:43:59.204 --> 00:44:00.338 align:middle line:90%
equivalent in gold.

00:44:00.338 --> 00:44:01.172 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:44:01.172 --> 00:44:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: I think it was at 35--

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.341 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- cents a--
every dollars an ounce.

00:44:03.341 --> 00:44:04.609 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: -- 35 dollars an ounce.

00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:06.444 align:middle line:90%
Yes. OK. And by the way,

00:44:06.444 --> 00:44:12.317 align:middle line:84%
just before the US suspended
the convertibility of dollar

00:44:12.317 --> 00:44:16.321 align:middle line:84%
into currency, that's when
you had another situation

00:44:16.321 --> 00:44:18.757 align:middle line:84%
where there was no
more leasing of gold.

00:44:18.757 --> 00:44:23.495 align:middle line:84%
So the market is signaling that
we are getting to a situation

00:44:23.495 --> 00:44:26.631 align:middle line:84%
where we have got to
try something else.

00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:27.432 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:44:27.432 --> 00:44:28.466 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: And the question is,

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:30.268 align:middle line:84%
what are we going to
do with that time?

00:44:30.268 --> 00:44:37.142 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm telling you is that
I have been regularly in touch

00:44:37.142 --> 00:44:39.878 align:middle line:90%
with all of the governors.

00:44:39.878 --> 00:44:42.313 align:middle line:84%
I've written to them
about four or five times.

00:44:42.313 --> 00:44:44.849 align:middle line:90%
I call up their offices.

00:44:44.849 --> 00:44:46.184 align:middle line:90%
They call me up.

00:44:46.184 --> 00:44:49.821 align:middle line:84%
I've been in touch with the
188 countries and I've said

00:44:49.821 --> 00:44:52.590 align:middle line:84%
to the countries I'm in
touch with the governors.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.528 align:middle line:84%
And so, they know that we have
got a system up and running

00:44:56.528 --> 00:45:00.532 align:middle line:84%
and we have got to
make good time of the--

00:45:00.532 --> 00:45:05.136 align:middle line:84%
good advantage of the time to
come to some orderly transition.

00:45:05.136 --> 00:45:08.473 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What about the notion
of nationalizing the currency

00:45:08.473 --> 00:45:13.411 align:middle line:84%
to basically disbanding the fed
and the United States, well,

00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:15.880 align:middle line:84%
such as in, I think is
North Dakota, isn't it?

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.447 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:17.549 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The notion of
states and governments--

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.218 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: You've studied
well for this.

00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:23.721 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- taking back the right
to print their own currency

00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:26.491 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of and for the people.

00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:28.726 align:middle line:84%
Do you see that as
a possibility even?

00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:30.028 align:middle line:90%
I mean, many people say,

00:45:30.028 --> 00:45:32.730 align:middle line:84%
"Why can't that we did find
a way to disband the fed?

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:33.498 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we?

00:45:33.498 --> 00:45:34.165 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Well--

00:45:34.165 --> 00:45:34.999 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Or should we?

00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:36.301 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Let's put it this way.

00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:39.103 align:middle line:84%
This is a conversation that
needs to be taking place.

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:42.040 align:middle line:84%
In each and every state, they
need to decide whether they want

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.311 align:middle line:84%
to follow the example of North
Dakota, whether they want

00:45:46.311 --> 00:45:51.616 align:middle line:84%
to do declare precious
metals as legal tender.

00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:52.617 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:52.617 --> 00:45:53.718 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: This is a
conversation that needs

00:45:53.718 --> 00:45:54.686 align:middle line:90%
to be taking place right now.

00:45:54.686 --> 00:45:55.787 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now, it sounds
like this is

00:45:55.787 --> 00:45:58.356 align:middle line:84%
where the average person
can become involved

00:45:58.356 --> 00:45:59.557 align:middle line:90%
in the conversation.

00:45:59.557 --> 00:46:02.026 align:middle line:90%
We can understand that.

00:46:02.026 --> 00:46:03.127 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean, that
we can comprehend.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:09.534 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the consequences of
not having this conversation,

00:46:09.534 --> 00:46:12.670 align:middle line:84%
in the near future as
far as you can see it?

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:17.041 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: The consequence is
that you have left a legacy

00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:19.711 align:middle line:84%
for your children that
you may not want them

00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:21.379 align:middle line:90%
to have, which is--

00:46:21.379 --> 00:46:22.347 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Spill it out.

00:46:22.347 --> 00:46:23.781 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: -- the super
entity is going

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:26.751 align:middle line:90%
to decide what it wants to do.

00:46:26.751 --> 00:46:29.153 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that it may want

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:33.391 align:middle line:90%
to do is to have FEMA camps.

00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:34.425 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:46:34.425 --> 00:46:36.661 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go there
for a minute, OK?

00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:39.731 align:middle line:84%
One of the things you say
is that, if they continue

00:46:39.731 --> 00:46:42.433 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate currencies
and we don't have any power

00:46:42.433 --> 00:46:45.203 align:middle line:84%
over the currencies ourselves,
just these private bankers

00:46:45.203 --> 00:46:47.872 align:middle line:84%
that we call-- we're
calling the super entity,

00:46:47.872 --> 00:46:49.307 align:middle line:84%
that have their fingers
and everything,

00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:51.543 align:middle line:90%
else including the media.

00:46:51.543 --> 00:46:58.816 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to-- how
does that translate to FEMA

00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:01.286 align:middle line:84%
and the media get
putting out stories

00:47:01.286 --> 00:47:04.389 align:middle line:84%
that keep us basically pitted
against each other on a number

00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:08.559 align:middle line:84%
of levels, to create a
potential for martial law

00:47:08.559 --> 00:47:09.761 align:middle line:90%
or the enactment, if you may?

00:47:09.761 --> 00:47:11.863 align:middle line:84%
You and I talked
about this off camera.

00:47:11.863 --> 00:47:15.333 align:middle line:84%
If that's what they're trying
to do, what is their end game?

00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:18.469 align:middle line:84%
What's in it for them to
institute martial law?

00:47:18.469 --> 00:47:21.839 align:middle line:84%
To have us upset enough, to
have our dollar devalued enough,

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:23.841 align:middle line:90%
to have us pouring angry enough

00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:25.843 align:middle line:84%
that they can institute
martial law.

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:27.245 align:middle line:90%
What's the end game there?

00:47:27.245 --> 00:47:30.348 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Because they will then
say anarchy is certainly not a

00:47:30.348 --> 00:47:32.583 align:middle line:84%
better alternative
than our solution

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:34.752 align:middle line:84%
and they will come
with a solution.

00:47:34.752 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And do you
have an idea what

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.155 align:middle line:90%
that solution is looking like?

00:47:37.155 --> 00:47:39.257 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, it's not
going to be dollars

00:47:39.257 --> 00:47:40.725 align:middle line:90%
because nobody wants dollars.

00:47:40.725 --> 00:47:44.963 align:middle line:84%
It may be something
like a single currency.

00:47:44.963 --> 00:47:46.497 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So that's where
the whole arguments

00:47:46.497 --> 00:47:48.066 align:middle line:90%
for one-world currency comes in.

00:47:48.066 --> 00:47:48.766 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yes.

00:47:48.766 --> 00:47:49.867 align:middle line:90%
But here's the problem.

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:52.537 align:middle line:84%
We already saw that
the BRICS are insisting

00:47:52.537 --> 00:47:54.172 align:middle line:90%
on not going forward with that.

00:47:54.172 --> 00:47:56.140 align:middle line:84%
That's when you get
into World War III.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.509 align:middle line:90%
We don't need World War III.

00:47:58.509 --> 00:48:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Why is it in the
United States interest

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.551 align:middle line:84%
to have the super entity
issuing a one-world currency?

00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:07.952 align:middle line:90%
That's not in our interest.

00:48:07.952 --> 00:48:08.653 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:48:08.653 --> 00:48:09.988 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Absolutely not.

00:48:09.988 --> 00:48:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that,
you know, I've been in touch

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:17.862 align:middle line:84%
with the Department of Defense
on this quite intensively

00:48:17.862 --> 00:48:21.299 align:middle line:84%
because the World Bank
is a knowledge bank.

00:48:21.299 --> 00:48:23.768 align:middle line:84%
So this was very accurate
stakeholder analysis.

00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:29.874 align:middle line:84%
In 2004, as a political
scientist named Jacek Kugler

00:48:29.874 --> 00:48:34.445 align:middle line:84%
came to me and he had
actually developed this--

00:48:34.445 --> 00:48:37.115 align:middle line:90%
it's using game theory.

00:48:37.115 --> 00:48:38.316 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:38.316 --> 00:48:41.719 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Using the ability
to analyze the situation,

00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:43.888 align:middle line:90%
translating it into numbers

00:48:43.888 --> 00:48:47.025 align:middle line:84%
and then letting the
computer do the simulation.

00:48:47.025 --> 00:48:51.529 align:middle line:84%
And, anyway, so I took Jasec
Kugler with me to Ghana

00:48:51.529 --> 00:48:56.467 align:middle line:84%
to see what was going on and
why a law wasn't getting passed.

00:48:56.467 --> 00:48:57.802 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Just to see how this--

00:48:57.802 --> 00:48:58.903 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Just to [inaudible]
it, to see how this model is.

00:48:58.903 --> 00:49:00.304 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- as a software,
how this plays out.

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.672 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: OK.

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:04.175 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that the
intelligence community has been

00:49:04.175 --> 00:49:07.812 align:middle line:84%
working with this model for
a number of years and it's 90

00:49:07.812 --> 00:49:09.247 align:middle line:90%
to 95 percent accurate.

00:49:09.247 --> 00:49:12.617 align:middle line:84%
If there's ever a disagreement
between the analysts

00:49:12.617 --> 00:49:15.086 align:middle line:90%
and the model, the model wins.

00:49:15.086 --> 00:49:18.523 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so, and that was how
I could tell the Treasury

00:49:18.523 --> 00:49:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Department in 2007 that if
we didn't play by the rules,

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.295 align:middle line:84%
we would lose the
Gentlemen's Agreement.

00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Bingo.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:26.397 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because this--
you had modeled it out.

00:49:26.397 --> 00:49:27.498 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: I had modeled
rule of law--

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:28.633 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Through that software.

00:49:28.633 --> 00:49:29.634 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: At the World Bank.

00:49:29.634 --> 00:49:30.768 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:49:30.768 --> 00:49:32.303 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: So what we have
is we have two models.

00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We have the model of
the world and the tra--

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.975 align:middle line:90%
they call it power transition.

00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:42.447 align:middle line:84%
And what this model that Jasec
Kugler had done showed was

00:49:42.447 --> 00:49:45.717 align:middle line:84%
that if the United States
played by the rules,

00:49:45.717 --> 00:49:49.353 align:middle line:84%
we would work together
with our western allies.

00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:53.758 align:middle line:84%
And as the eastern Asia
countries grew more powerful

00:49:53.758 --> 00:49:57.195 align:middle line:84%
gradually over, say,
a period of 50 years,

00:49:57.195 --> 00:50:00.364 align:middle line:84%
there would be a peaceful
transition of power.

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:03.668 align:middle line:84%
But it said, if we
tried to go it alone

00:50:03.668 --> 00:50:07.105 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't observe the
rule of law, we were going

00:50:07.105 --> 00:50:12.477 align:middle line:84%
to have a currency war and
China would come up very fast.

00:50:12.477 --> 00:50:19.584 align:middle line:84%
And I went to-- at that time
in 2008, I went to Chuck Hagel

00:50:19.584 --> 00:50:21.886 align:middle line:84%
who was then the
senator of Nebraska.

00:50:21.886 --> 00:50:24.822 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Playing
cat and mouse

00:50:24.822 --> 00:50:31.796 align:middle line:84%
with these issues is a
terrible security risk

00:50:31.796 --> 00:50:33.297 align:middle line:90%
for the United States."

00:50:33.297 --> 00:50:37.001 align:middle line:84%
So when Chuck Hagel became
the Secretary of Defense,

00:50:37.001 --> 00:50:39.237 align:middle line:90%
I wrote the Defense Department.

00:50:39.237 --> 00:50:42.507 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Inspector
General and I said,

00:50:42.507 --> 00:50:44.242 align:middle line:84%
"There is a very
accurate model that's

00:50:44.242 --> 00:50:45.343 align:middle line:90%
in the Department of Defense."

00:50:45.343 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And the person who was
the project manager

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.052 align:middle line:84%
for that department wrote me
from LinkedIn and she knew

00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:58.689 align:middle line:84%
as well as I that we
needed to have rule of law

00:50:58.689 --> 00:51:03.795 align:middle line:84%
and take back the power
from that super entity.

00:51:03.795 --> 00:51:07.331 align:middle line:84%
And I have been following
this issue with--

00:51:07.331 --> 00:51:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Talk about
David and Goliath.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.168 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Well, I know.

00:51:10.168 --> 00:51:11.335 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I love it.

00:51:11.335 --> 00:51:12.170 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:13.271 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: They all know everybody.

00:51:13.271 --> 00:51:15.239 align:middle line:84%
And-- but don't forget
I've also been

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:16.941 align:middle line:90%
in touch with the countries.

00:51:16.941 --> 00:51:18.075 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:19.477 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And I've said to
the countries, "Well,

00:51:19.477 --> 00:51:22.947 align:middle line:84%
this is the letter that I have
been sending to the governors--

00:51:22.947 --> 00:51:24.215 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:51:24.215 --> 00:51:27.051 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: -- and the 10 governors
that are on this group

00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:30.454 align:middle line:84%
that are setup under the
Department of Homeland Security

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:33.424 align:middle line:84%
and Peter Verga who is
the assistant secretary."

00:51:33.424 --> 00:51:36.494 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I see
an article that looks--

00:51:36.494 --> 00:51:38.963 align:middle line:84%
so for example, on July
4th, they were trying

00:51:38.963 --> 00:51:41.966 align:middle line:90%
to have armed people marching.

00:51:41.966 --> 00:51:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, I went to
these 10 governors.

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:50.775 align:middle line:84%
It's-- one of the chair of
the-- there's two co-chairs,

00:51:50.775 --> 00:51:54.545 align:middle line:84%
my governor, Martin
O'Malley from Maryland is one

00:51:54.545 --> 00:51:58.716 align:middle line:84%
of the co-chairs and so is
Governor Branstad from Iowa.

00:51:58.716 --> 00:52:02.486 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Which would you
rather have, inciting riots

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:05.556 align:middle line:84%
or that we have a
peaceful transition?"

00:52:05.556 --> 00:52:10.561 align:middle line:84%
And I said to all of the
188 ambassadors, I said,

00:52:10.561 --> 00:52:12.763 align:middle line:90%
"We are working the problem."

00:52:12.763 --> 00:52:14.031 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And you're not alone.

00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people,
even people that are very,

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.202 align:middle line:84%
very well-known and
what has been called the

00:52:18.202 --> 00:52:19.437 align:middle line:90%
conspiracy community.

00:52:19.437 --> 00:52:20.805 align:middle line:90%
I don't really like that term

00:52:20.805 --> 00:52:23.107 align:middle line:84%
for just revealing what's been
hidden shouldn't be called a

00:52:23.107 --> 00:52:25.276 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy but they're
also speaking

00:52:25.276 --> 00:52:26.644 align:middle line:90%
up saying the same thing.

00:52:26.644 --> 00:52:28.613 align:middle line:84%
"Don't take to the
streets and riot.

00:52:28.613 --> 00:52:31.882 align:middle line:84%
Just engage from the game and
start working through education

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:33.718 align:middle line:90%
and creating the new game."

00:52:33.718 --> 00:52:35.353 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not
alone in saying that.

00:52:35.353 --> 00:52:36.621 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: What I'm trying to say is

00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:40.124 align:middle line:84%
that this new game is
very well articulate.

00:52:40.124 --> 00:52:41.125 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:52:41.125 --> 00:52:44.161 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And the information
is there.

00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:45.396 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:47.665 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: It's-- and the
parties are taking it very,

00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:49.000 align:middle line:90%
very seriously.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was reinstated
by 188 Ministers of Finance.

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:53.804 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What's happened?

00:52:53.804 --> 00:52:55.539 align:middle line:84%
You're reinstated then
went to jail or you went

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:57.508 align:middle line:90%
to jail or then reinstated?

00:52:57.508 --> 00:52:58.342 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: OK.

00:52:58.342 --> 00:52:59.977 align:middle line:90%
Here is how beautiful it is.

00:52:59.977 --> 00:53:04.382 align:middle line:84%
There is a company named
AlliedBarton that hired all

00:53:04.382 --> 00:53:06.150 align:middle line:90%
of the security personnel.

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:07.118 align:middle line:90%
So those people--

00:53:07.118 --> 00:53:08.286 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: No, let's
give the background.

00:53:08.286 --> 00:53:09.954 align:middle line:90%
You're trying to reenter what?

00:53:09.954 --> 00:53:11.656 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to
physically go where?

00:53:11.656 --> 00:53:12.957 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Into the World Bank.

00:53:12.957 --> 00:53:13.491 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:53:13.491 --> 00:53:14.158 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Yeah.

00:53:14.158 --> 00:53:14.558 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: There we go.

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:15.693 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:15.693 --> 00:53:17.561 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And the Ministers
of Finance said, "OK-- "

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.597 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: This is very
recently by the way.

00:53:19.597 --> 00:53:24.535 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, the lawsuit was
settled on December 20th.

00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:30.074 align:middle line:84%
And then there was this
meeting on April 20th

00:53:30.074 --> 00:53:31.676 align:middle line:84%
when I was given
a security badge.

00:53:31.676 --> 00:53:32.376 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:33.544 align:middle line:90%
So you were good to go,

00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:34.845 align:middle line:84%
if you come back home,
go back to your--

00:53:34.845 --> 00:53:37.181 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: I went in-- actually,
you know, I actually went

00:53:37.181 --> 00:53:38.816 align:middle line:90%
in on the 19th of April.

00:53:38.816 --> 00:53:40.785 align:middle line:90%
I went into the spring meeting.

00:53:40.785 --> 00:53:42.019 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:43.788 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And then, when I
went to go back on the 20th,

00:53:43.788 --> 00:53:47.525 align:middle line:84%
the Secret Service said
I couldn't go back in.

00:53:47.525 --> 00:53:50.828 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Who are you
to say that I can't go?

00:53:50.828 --> 00:53:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Here's my security badge."

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:57.001 align:middle line:84%
And then I went home
and I wrote a letter

00:53:57.001 --> 00:54:02.206 align:middle line:84%
to Julia Pierson who's the new
director of the Secret Service.

00:54:02.206 --> 00:54:04.542 align:middle line:90%
But before I sent it, I sent it

00:54:04.542 --> 00:54:08.112 align:middle line:84%
to my friends, all
of the countries.

00:54:08.112 --> 00:54:09.213 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:54:09.213 --> 00:54:10.981 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: I sent it to
the executive directors

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:14.318 align:middle line:84%
and I sent it to
Dr. Belka who's--

00:54:14.318 --> 00:54:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Basically saying
you have every right

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.588 align:middle line:90%
to answer that [inaudible].

00:54:17.588 --> 00:54:18.489 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: I said, "If there's
anything in this letter--

00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:21.625 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: -- that's incorrect, let
me know and I won't send it."

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:22.626 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So how did you end up--

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:23.427 align:middle line:84%
we only have a couple
of minutes left.

00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:24.662 align:middle line:90%
How did you end up in jail?

00:54:24.662 --> 00:54:26.797 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:54:26.797 --> 00:54:27.765 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: OK.

00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:31.569 align:middle line:84%
So, that I was kind
of surprised.

00:54:31.569 --> 00:54:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, yeah, really?

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:36.741 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Actually, I was, because
I went to the chief of police

00:54:36.741 --> 00:54:38.743 align:middle line:90%
in the District of Columbia.

00:54:38.743 --> 00:54:41.612 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "If you
think that the governors

00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:45.116 align:middle line:84%
of the World Bank have
not reinstated me,

00:54:45.116 --> 00:54:46.984 align:middle line:90%
would you please let me know

00:54:46.984 --> 00:54:49.487 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going back
there in the afternoon.

00:54:49.487 --> 00:54:51.856 align:middle line:84%
Here's their email address,
just send them an email."

00:54:51.856 --> 00:54:52.857 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:54:52.857 --> 00:54:54.558 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: And so, I
walked in there and--

00:54:54.558 --> 00:54:56.560 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.863 align:middle line:90%
-- they called the police.

00:54:58.863 --> 00:55:01.932 align:middle line:84%
And when the police came,
they were two agents.

00:55:01.932 --> 00:55:04.769 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said--
I said, "You know,

00:55:04.769 --> 00:55:06.771 align:middle line:84%
why don't you call
your commander--

00:55:06.771 --> 00:55:07.471 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:08.639 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: -- Michael Reese

00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:11.175 align:middle line:84%
and he will call Dr.
Belka and we'll be fine."

00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
put me in handcuffs

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and put me in a police car--

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.081 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I don't know
if this was your--

00:55:17.081 --> 00:55:18.482 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: -- and threw me in jail.

00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:20.551 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I don't know if this was
your highest or lowest points

00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:21.685 align:middle line:90%
in all of your efforts.

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:24.155 align:middle line:84%
Certainly no good
deed goes unpunished.

00:55:24.155 --> 00:55:27.024 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: Well, you know, there
have been many twists and turns.

00:55:27.024 --> 00:55:28.392 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They really happen.

00:55:28.392 --> 00:55:31.162 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: I have to say that I
am working together with a lot

00:55:31.162 --> 00:55:32.696 align:middle line:90%
of other whistleblowers and--

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.799 align:middle line:84%
but some of these
people have been through.

00:55:34.799 --> 00:55:35.633 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, it's horrible.

00:55:35.633 --> 00:55:36.867 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed some, yes.

00:55:36.867 --> 00:55:39.437 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: And so, I've actually--

00:55:39.437 --> 00:55:42.273 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You're here
to talk about it.

00:55:42.273 --> 00:55:44.241 align:middle line:84%
But as you said off camera
and you said earlier--

00:55:44.241 --> 00:55:46.110 align:middle line:90%
we only have a few seconds left,

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:49.113 align:middle line:84%
the reality is you
can do all of this.

00:55:49.113 --> 00:55:51.816 align:middle line:84%
You and all the whistleblowers
can put yourselves on the line.

00:55:51.816 --> 00:55:55.820 align:middle line:84%
But if we're not backing
you up, it has no power.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.189 align:middle line:84%
>> KH: I manage with
the stakeholder analysis

00:55:58.189 --> 00:55:59.423 align:middle line:90%
and with the people.

00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:00.591 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's right.

00:56:00.591 --> 00:56:03.127 align:middle line:84%
Karen, thank you so much
for taking the trouble

00:56:03.127 --> 00:56:04.328 align:middle line:90%
to come here and talk with us.

00:56:04.328 --> 00:56:06.096 align:middle line:84%
I know it's been very hard
to get your message out

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:08.232 align:middle line:84%
and I think you've
been very inspirational

00:56:08.232 --> 00:56:09.600 align:middle line:90%
in putting it back on us.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.935 align:middle line:90%
That's where it needs to be.

00:56:10.935 --> 00:56:11.769 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:56:11.769 --> 00:56:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> KH: Thank you for having me.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:15.406 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: This is a story that is a
bottomless pit if you're looking

00:56:15.406 --> 00:56:17.842 align:middle line:84%
at it through the shadows but
Karen has brought the facts

00:56:17.842 --> 00:56:20.344 align:middle line:84%
to daylight for anyone
who cares to see.

00:56:20.344 --> 00:56:23.614 align:middle line:84%
