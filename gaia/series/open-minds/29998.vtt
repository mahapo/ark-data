00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.702 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In
more progressive circles,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.120 align:middle line:84%
there's been discussion that
our countries might benefit

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:84%
from looking at repurposing the
military for peaceful endeavors

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:90%
rather than war.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a new idea.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:84%
During the Vietnam War,
Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channon

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:84%
made a public address
to a military think tank

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that a
soldier has a higher

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
purpose-- his
soul-- to consider,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and that peace should
be the ultimate goal.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
It makes complete sense when
you're facing life and death

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
situations every day,
as he and his men did.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood, however, decided
to poke a little fun at him

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:84%
in the film "Men Who Stare at
Goats," in which Jim was played

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
by Jeff Bridges as the leader
of the First Earth Battalion.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I met with Jim in
Winchester, England,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.300 align:middle line:84%
at the Winchester
College Studios.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Jim, I have to ask you this.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into
the intriguing part

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.670 align:middle line:84%
that everybody wants to know
about and we have to get to,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you how did
a sweetheart like yourself

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.210 align:middle line:90%
choose a life in the military.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.475 align:middle line:90%
No less a harsh tour of duty.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.011 align:middle line:84%
>>JIM CHANNON: Well, I was
a good 20th century man,

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:90%
I did what my father told me.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what he did.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:90%
He did what his father told him.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And it worked out great
because I flunked the exam

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:84%
to West Point, so I got to go
to a party school after all.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So I partied myself
crazy for four years

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and still went to ROTC and
got the same darn lieutenant

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:90%
of regular infantry.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Four years service.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was right
about it all along.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, you do four
years and then you see.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And what he knew
that I didn't know

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
is that the variety of
challenge in the military

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
was just what I was up
for because you never

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.750 align:middle line:90%
do the same thing twice.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of danger involved.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:90%
There was in this case.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of growth
goes with danger.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a hero's journey
advocate, absolutely.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:90%
It's always been that way.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Look back as far
as you want to go.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.995 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of good stuff,
and a lot of bad stuff

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
pushing the good stuff
around until it wakes up.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So really it
was a perfect jumping off

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.314 align:middle line:84%
point for you to do
the hero's journey.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.014 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not that you have to go
into the military to be a hero.

00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Absolutely, yeah.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But for you, the
whole notion of light and dark

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.567 align:middle line:90%
bouncing off of each other.

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Stop and go.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:90%
You know it is these days.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:90%
You wake up.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
You think you want
to do something.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, fine.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And then your
computer won't work.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.854 align:middle line:84%
And you can't call
what's his name.

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: And you have to wait.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And then something, if
you're awake, appears.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
hero's journey of today

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.380 align:middle line:84%
as we are, well,
on our way to being

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.099 align:middle line:84%
fifth dimensional beings
or something better.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Since we've already
gone to other dimensions,

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%
let's go ahead and
get into the story

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that most people are familiar
with, which was the Hollywood

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
version of your
life, to an extent.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:84%
At least, a portion of your life
as portrayed by Jeff Bridges

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.719 align:middle line:90%
in "Men Who Stare at Goats."

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Good old Jeff.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I had to see
that film because I've always

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
been intrigued with
remote viewing, especially

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
the military and the
intelligence community

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.772 align:middle line:90%
applications of it.

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And also I thought,
I've got to see

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:90%
what they're doing with this.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So rather than giving
my big fat opinion

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
of what they did with
that film, tell us

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
how you felt about how
the subject and what

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:90%
you were really doing.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:90%
What your life was really like.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:84%
What you were trying to give
during that period of time

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and how you felt about
the portrayal of it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.016 align:middle line:90%
in "Men Who Stare at Goats."

00:03:58.016 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: The first I heard of
it is a script came in the mail

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:90%
from BBC.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And the producer
called and said, look,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
George Clooney just
bought this script,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're not going to make it
unless you agree to sign away

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:84%
all of your rights to suing us
for what we do with your story.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And initially, when
I read it, I was

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:84%
horrified because
this was not ennobling

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.950 align:middle line:84%
to all of the guys
in the military who

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
stuck their creative
necks out as far

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
as they could go to really dare
to think of the unthinkable.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it would
be a disservice to them

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:90%
to have the movie made.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got up a couple days
later and I thought, you know,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
as much as I talk
and as much as I

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:84%
think about how the Army
could help the planet,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:84%
it's not actually making
it through the hairball.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
The web, bless its heart,
is just doing wonders.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.194 align:middle line:84%
But if Einstein were trying
to get his idea of E equals MC

00:05:06.194 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:90%
through the web?

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.625 align:middle line:90%
Not going anywhere.

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, George
Clooney, Jeff Bridges,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Kevin Spacey downfield
blocking for me?

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll take a risk.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So the Jedi came up and said
OK, I'll play this game.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Let the cards fall
where they may.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.111 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You signed
the release as it was.

00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: I signed a release.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
the other few people

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:90%
that were asked signed it, too.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Something about
Hollywood, you know?

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.619 align:middle line:90%
It's an invitation.

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is alluring.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: It is.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, being roasted by
Jeff Bridges and George Clooney

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
is not actually an insult
in any way, shape, or form.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
That is a warrior's hand
clap of the highest order.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:90%
So what the hell?

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They made this material
and put it on the screen.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.965 align:middle line:84%
And of course, half of it was
distorted to make it funny.

00:06:02.965 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.923 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Well, it's a cartoon.

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:08.045 align:middle line:84%
And it was sort of
an edgy cartoon.

00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:90%
It was a psycho edgy cartoon.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, well, I never was
as fat as Jeff, or as groungy

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
as Jeff, or let my margarita
roll down on my beard

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.720 align:middle line:90%
like Jeff.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:90%
But I was a good heart.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'm ever grateful.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Who could better play anybody?

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.966 align:middle line:90%
What an honor, Jeff Bridges.

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Everybody
loves Jeff Bridges.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And he just got
more famous after that.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when the
airboat opened up

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and people are asking the
question, who was Jim Channon?

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.396 align:middle line:90%
Hello, here I am.

00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And I have stuff to pass out.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:90%
So it worked great in the end.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.477 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, my
kids thought I was cool.

00:06:55.477 --> 00:06:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very cool.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Did you stare at goats?

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: No.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I never heard of that idea
until the book came out

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:90%
by Jon Ronson.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jon Ronson did come to
my house a couple years before

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and interviewed-- he
didn't interview me.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.685 align:middle line:90%
He was carrying some equipment.

00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
He was a gaffer or
a grip or something.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:90%
But he was listening.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And he got enough information
about the paranormal

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
to say hey, there's some
edge here, and I'll work it.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Then the guy who got
the book from him

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
upgraded it by making it
the kind of comedy which

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
helps people in the audience
let go of old ideas.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Old idea one being army guys
go in and shoot everything.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:90%
They break things.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:90%
The blow shit up.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.434 align:middle line:84%
Well, the guys in the
goats made them to do that.

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:84%
They played with animals
and let the prisoners

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:90%
go home for dinner.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, that stereotype needed to
be established because that's

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:84%
exactly how our armed
forces, for the most part,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:06.100 align:middle line:84%
are trained to behave in
the new counter-insurgency,

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
counter-terrorist environment.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way soldiers
can behave because soldiers

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
are pretty much built with
a heart of a Boy Scout.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they're
adventure-seeking as general.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.739 align:middle line:84%
They want to get out of town--
like some women too-- early.

00:08:20.739 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
bit of adrenaline.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Be bored to death.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Experience a
rush here and there, yeah.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: But fundamentally,
they're service-oriented.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And my intention, of course, is
that eventually all the armies

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:90%
will be restoring the biosphere.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I want
to get into that project.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, what were you
actually doing?

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:84%
We saw how it was portrayed
with George Clooney and Jeff

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Bridges.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:90%
What were you actually doing?

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: What I was doing
was being part of a think tank

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:84%
that was frightened that
the Soviets were going

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
to outgun and out-man us if
we ever had to fight them

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.260 align:middle line:90%
in the Fulda Gap in Germany.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And assembled the
best thinkers they

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.881 align:middle line:84%
could to say, how can
we protect our soldiers?

00:09:03.881 --> 00:09:04.505 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this.

00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple mission.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.730 align:middle line:84%
How do we protect our
soldiers and teams of soldiers

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.326 align:middle line:84%
on the battlefield when they're
out-manned and outgunned?

00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
what you were part of?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: I was part
of that think tank.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.394 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Find a
creative problem

00:09:18.394 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:90%
solving in that situation.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And I chose to
go after the human being.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the
time of the-- what's

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.925 align:middle line:84%
that great book
Stewart Brand produced?

00:09:31.925 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:90%
The big "Whole Earth Catalog."

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: So I found my
way into sports situations,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
some New Age situations
that involved

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
the physical body, the
energetic body, breathing

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:84%
control, mental
control, sensing.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I took some from
hunters and whatnot.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I hand drew a 125-page field
manual for a mythical unit.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And it just came to me on the
plane going to the think tank

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:84%
meeting, the First
Earth Battalion.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:90%
So I got there.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And right away, I
could tell, because I

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
was dealing with matters like
soul, and energy, and whatnot.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I had to tell the think
tank-- they were expecting

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
me to make a report-- tell them
I had no interest in giving

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
them a cold, hard
fact information

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
briefing about a subject that
was way different than that.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- and I just
figured this out sort

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:84%
of on my feet-- you come
to the officers' club

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:90%
on Thursday night.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And I want to initiate you
into the mythical First Earth

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Battalion.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.296 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't know
what to think of that.

00:11:00.296 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They didn't.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Why were you chosen
to begin with,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:90%
to be part of this think tank?

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: I had a
reputation for writing

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.269 align:middle line:84%
in military journals, for
thinking, for drawing.

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there we go.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the
officers' club early.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And I arranged all the plastic
flowers in the back room

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and turned off the lights, all
but a candle and a dollar bill.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And when they started
coming into the room,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I had them take their
shoes off and get

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:90%
in a circle around the candle.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, they knew I'd
been in California,

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:44.245 align:middle line:84%
so they began to snicker and
chuckle amongst themselves.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You think.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And then
when I said, we're

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:84%
going to begin this meeting
by locking in the energy field

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
by doing the mantra
E for the Earth.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just say
E together until you

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.360 align:middle line:90%
can feel when it locks in.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And they just looked back
at me like oh, golly.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Certifiable
at this point, yeah.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Here we go.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:90%
And we started.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was full of
laughing, and gurbling,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and choking, and
coughing, and all sorts

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
of distractive,
runaway techniques.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I stepped on my platoon
commander's posture

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and I said, gentlemen,
it's not up to standard.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.545 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do this again.

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:37.180 align:middle line:90%
And they went, oh, damn.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, this time, you're
allowed to take a breath,

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.075 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:40.575 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Eee.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And as sound does, it unified
the water bubbles in the air,

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and coalesced, and
made coherent the space

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:84%
around the men standing in
a circle, who then felt it.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Then out comes
Colonel Mike Malone,

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
who was the Army's sort of wild
storyteller-poet laureate, who

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:84%
also made fun of things
inside the system.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And he did a beautiful
Korean hard style karate

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.072 align:middle line:90%
kata, which is a warrior dance.

00:13:20.072 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:90%
And everybody went, OK.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:90%
This guy could smoke a cigar.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:90%
We can do the rest of this.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Off we went.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I told the story
about the dollar bill

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and the principles of
the original founders.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And some things to say we are
entering a spiritual domain

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:43.880 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
about life and death,

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and doing things on
behalf of life and death,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about a
spiritual dimension.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's not pretend this
is all about the toys,

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:90%
and the guns, and the bullets.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's pretend this
is about our souls.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there were some
more things that went on.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell at
about 25 minutes,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:90%
there was just had enough.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, now,
you're not supposed

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:84%
to make up your mind
about this information.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to let it in.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Absorb.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.096 align:middle line:90%
Imagine you've had a dream.

00:14:20.096 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll see you tomorrow
in the conference room.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I reported to the
conference room in the morning,

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
there was this sort
of guy outside.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't an MP with
white leggings and a helmet.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
But he said, Colonel
Channon, you're not to go in.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:90%
You're not to go in.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.176 align:middle line:90%
The door is closed to you.

00:14:43.176 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear this-- I
could hear deliberations.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, ooh,
the trial has begun.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.304 align:middle line:90%
You have gone too far this time.

00:14:55.304 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
you're known to do.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Just boom.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm always crossing the
line, but that was too far.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:90%
And then doors opened magically.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the military-sounding
tone, "Colonel Channon,

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:90%
report!"

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.745 align:middle line:84%
Sorry for that sound
effects, but, you know,

00:15:14.745 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:90%
I know where that is.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a space, too.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
That's a semi-trance space.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the
room came to attention.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:84%
They pointed for me to
stand and face the group.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And Colonel Malone said,
"Attention to orders.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
From this point forward you,
Lieutenant Colonel James B.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Channon, are appointed the
commander of the First Earth

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Battalion.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:84%
To go forward in space
and time, and dare

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.065 align:middle line:90%
to think the unthinkable."

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How amazing.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Were you shocked?

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: I'm still shocked.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still doing it.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this gave
you license for what?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Well, to continue
to pursue what at that time

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a name,
called the paranormal.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:84%
But it was definitely
fringe-o stuff.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that I'd
had four combat commands,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
so I wasn't going to play
around with these ideas.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.007 align:middle line:84%
I was going to bring them to
bear on something practical.

00:16:17.007 --> 00:16:18.756 align:middle line:84%
And they saw all the
drawings in the book.

00:16:18.756 --> 00:16:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, this
guy, he can make the book too.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:90%
No, the book wasn't there then.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I brought the book
in the next time.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But they knew my reputation
was good for presenting

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:90%
information, so off I went.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, you had
done hardcore duty already

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yes.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you
said, they knew

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:90%
you weren't messing around.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.158 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you
came up with would

00:16:41.158 --> 00:16:42.367 align:middle line:90%
have a practical application.

00:16:42.367 --> 00:16:43.324 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: That's true.

00:16:43.324 --> 00:16:45.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about remote viewing a bit.

00:16:45.745 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
some of the things

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.328 align:middle line:84%
you were developing, who
you were working with,

00:16:49.328 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and what the practical
applications were.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: In combat
in the first year,

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I took 65 guys through
triple canopy jungle

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:04.560 align:middle line:84%
to find Viet Cong in
village base camps,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
where they lay all dug in in
tunnels with their weapons

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:18.089 align:middle line:84%
at the ready in order to shoo
them off and burn their huts.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is Rome
trying to go in and play

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:90%
with hardcore guerrillas.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So my obligation was not to
walk my 65 guys into a ambush--

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In a trap, yeah.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: --every day.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So the first day of
combat, I lost a man.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And 14 other things
happened, only two of which

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd ever been trained to
make a decision about.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
So right away I
took responsibility.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Said OK, this is going
to be my operation.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
this as a team.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
To hell with what we thought
we learned in school.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:90%
We're going to stay alive.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, most of us
didn't have any real intentions

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.670 align:middle line:84%
about killing North Vietnamese
or South Vietnamese.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know who they were.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
the papers said.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:90%
We're more grown up than that.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So what I noticed as we began
to move off the next day

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:84%
is that certain of my men
were kind of psychically moved

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:90%
by something.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And the first time,
it was Johnson.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.705 align:middle line:84%
And Johnson, I said,
what's going on, Johnson?

00:18:35.705 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
He says, it's right
here in my belly, Sir.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean, Johnson?

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean something's
about to happen.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.990 align:middle line:90%
How soon?

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:90%
About 200 meters or 20 minutes.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And I said, thank you, Johnson.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.025 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And as we went forward,
more and more men

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
had different types of
clairvoyance or clairaudience.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Our ears got way better
than they ever were.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
We could actually feel
when the forest got quiet

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
because if there were
people getting set up,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:90%
the birds will leave.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And so it went.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So after 319 days, where I
had everybody still alive--

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: --I knew that the
Homo sapiens was a good thing

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
That dropping into
our animal bodies

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:84%
gave us some real tools that had
always been there with animals.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't have any
scientific names then.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:84%
They weren't paranormal
or remote viewing.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have that word.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But as I brought things into
the First Earth Battalion field

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.410 align:middle line:84%
manual, I included
a lot of those kind

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
of extra sensory
perception elements.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And as the generals
pushed that manual out--

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and they printed 350
copies at the War College--

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and they knew who the
brightest officers in the Army

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
were and they sent
them to those guys.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And they then had psychic
and unified position

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:90%
to act creatively.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:21.365 align:middle line:84%
So they used me to
put the spark plug in.

00:20:21.365 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I became known in the
Army as the lightning rod.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And they would call me,
generals would call me,

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:84%
to talk to 100 other generals,
or 1,000 officers, or whatever.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would do something
about the future that

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
was dramatic storytelling
and definitely shamanic.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I would always make fun of
the stuff that didn't work.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the holy fool, you know?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I would introduce
the things that might work.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So across the board,
the buzz in the Army

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.300 align:middle line:90%
was you can be creative.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So the guys at Fort Bragg
who were working with goats

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:84%
thought, well, maybe they'd
try some psychic connections

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.554 align:middle line:90%
with goats.

00:21:04.554 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anything about this.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.345 align:middle line:84%
It was just running along
under its own power.

00:21:09.345 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a mixed opinion, but
evidently one man I know

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
personally said
yes, he saw a goat

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:90%
drop, but only semi-consciously.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jon Ronson tells
the story about bursting

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:90%
the heart of a goat.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.830 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Sell your book, Jon.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
Jon, to his credit,

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:84%
got the phrase sparkly
eyes in the book.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And he has some of
the best sparkly eyes.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's been using
that ever since.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:90%
I actually like Jon.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Jon is a holy fool as well.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:84%
He makes a mess on
the floor so that when

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
you put the pieces
back together,

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.304 align:middle line:84%
they have to be put
together differently.

00:21:52.304 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
what was interesting

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:84%
is you go into an
environment where

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:84%
people are told to
march to their orders.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:84%
But what you were
saying-- you were totally

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.297 align:middle line:90%
deconstructing that.

00:22:01.297 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: That's correct.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.046 align:middle line:90%
That's the word.

00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Deconstructing.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.383 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:04.383 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: That's
exactly how it works.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
deconstructed that.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:90%
You wrote this manual.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
It was distributed to 350
of the brightest officers.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.019 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yes.

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:17.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it
actually utilized

00:22:17.435 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and implemented
beyond your brigade?

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Well, it was doing
the same job "The Whole Earth

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Catalog" did.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:84%
The bright officers went through
and said, page four, you know?

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Prana, what a concept.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Gee, I have to put my men
underground for 20 days

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:90%
during a nuclear attack.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I think they need to
learn to meditate and run

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.275 align:middle line:90%
their energy while not moving.

00:22:45.275 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it was
very practically-based.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: It was grown-up.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
yeah very grown-up.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.493 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: You're the grown-ups.

00:22:50.493 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:84%
You figure out
what's useful here.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
was so interesting-- you

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:90%
said this several minutes ago.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.160 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about the fact this

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:90%
is a matter of life and death.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.924 align:middle line:90%
This is a matter of soul.

00:22:59.924 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that's not
something that I would think

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:84%
would be commonly
spoken about when

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.727 align:middle line:84%
you sign up for
your tours of duty.

00:23:06.727 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: No.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Especially since Hollywood
has made most of the movies

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.470 align:middle line:84%
about basic training,
where everybody

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:90%
goes around yelling at privates.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But the best commandos I ever
met, at the highest ranks,

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I've met some that all
made their own bibles.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:84%
They made their own bibles for
a multiple religious beliefs.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And they generally kept
them over their heart

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:90%
with a kind of medal.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So these guys knew
they were signing up

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:90%
to be at the edge of it.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:84%
They had to be able to
answer the question,

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.270 align:middle line:84%
can I shoot somebody
and can I die?

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Well hello, spirit.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:84%
You better check
your soul state out

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:59.610 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be in that
place and be functional.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Because most soldiers are not
functional at shooting anybody,

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.760 align:middle line:90%
and it's been true in every war.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
you think about that.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.940 align:middle line:84%
That's not anything I've ever
given any serious thought

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.622 align:middle line:84%
to because that wasn't
part of my trajectory.

00:24:13.622 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Right.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Certainly not
now, not in this life.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet I've always
wondered, how does somebody

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:90%
respond to a call like that?

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you're forced
into service through a draft,

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
How does this work when
your life is literally

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:90%
going to be put on the line?

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Well, the ones that
are just brought into service

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:40.230 align:middle line:84%
or come off the streets
because they don't have a job

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:84%
need to have an experience
where they face death.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And they find an unusually
strange, calm thing happens

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:53.850 align:middle line:84%
to them, just like a
black belt in the ring.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And they can get
slightly addicted

00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:04.220 align:middle line:84%
to that state of full
presence, complete clarity.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was exemplified
in the movie "The Hurt Locker."

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.036 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: It was.

00:25:09.036 --> 00:25:10.050 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, that experience
doesn't happen often.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But those who catch a whiff of
that very often say, well, OK.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I can't just go home
and forget this.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I have to take this
a little further.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So they volunteer for the
commando jobs and the more

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.670 align:middle line:84%
exposure to
independent thinking.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And gosh, there's some pretty
crazy movies out right now

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:90%
about those kinds of characters.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I don't think
that's any stranger than people

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:84%
being exposed to
combat and helping

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:84%
a village in
Afghanistan, go home,

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:84%
all the pressure
goes off, and it's

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:84%
the same old boring
story every day.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.122 align:middle line:90%
That's not a life either.

00:26:01.122 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's interesting.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here, I'm
a mother of a son.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And of course I
would do anything

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:84%
to stop my child
from having to go

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:84%
to war like any
mother of any son

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.460 align:middle line:84%
pretty much, unless
you're a military family.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
But it sounds like what
you're saying-- I mean,

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:90%
we have to call it war.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it has to be war
in the context of today.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was
another way in which

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.490 align:middle line:84%
to experience this
in times past.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
there's a place for this

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:90%
in the development of a man.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Sure.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:90%
I have to say that.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, again,
history has been replete

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
with this constant edge
is always available.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And the people who want to
feel something about themselves

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
at a deeper level, they step
into the crack very often.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.762 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.762 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
theoretically, stepping

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
to the edge of oneself should
be able to happen in ways

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:84%
in which the life
isn't in danger,

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.960 align:middle line:84%
but, say, your ego's feeling
very, very vulnerable

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.940 align:middle line:90%
or threatened.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, stepping to the edge of
your skill set in a given area

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.285 align:middle line:84%
or going onto stage, for
example, as an artist or actor.

00:27:19.285 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Yes, with
1,000 people out there--

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With a 1,000
people out there.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.024 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: --waiting
to be entertained.

00:27:23.024 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Or getting on the London
tube and changing three times

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to get here to talk to you when
I've never been on one of those

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:30.910 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:32.004 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the edge.

00:27:32.004 --> 00:27:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing is,
it's not dangerous.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you make
a mistake, you're

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:84%
80 miles out into Timbuktu,
you know, before you recover.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So the preparation
in the military

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.830 align:middle line:84%
gives me the ability
to settle myself

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:90%
when I go into a new situation.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So I can go into situations
that are way more complicated.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.670 align:middle line:84%
You could ask me
right now-- you said

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:84%
there's 5,000 people out
there in the audience

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and the speaker just had a
heart attack-- what can we do?

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Can you go on, Jim?

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.640 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, I can go on.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.280 align:middle line:90%
I will go on.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.674 align:middle line:84%
I've actually been way
better in those experiences.

00:28:15.674 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is the
total presence thing.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we hear about Eckhart
Tolle and "The Power of Now,"

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:21.470 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:25.410 align:middle line:84%
That's been one of the
backbone publications

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:30.456 align:middle line:84%
within the what's erroneously
called the New Age community.

00:28:30.456 --> 00:28:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yes.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But "The Power of Now"
is what you're speaking about.

00:28:33.705 --> 00:28:36.630 align:middle line:90%
The presence of now.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: It's really--
needs to be talked

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
about even more because
in Western society,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and in the 20th century, our
heads ran away from our bodies.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happened when we worked.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And we worked according
to thinking about this,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and thinking and talking
about-- the circle was this big.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.310 align:middle line:84%
It never went back
down and joined.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk about
presencing yourself

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:84%
into danger, where your
animal must be awake,

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:84%
you might get lucky and
hook them both back up

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:84%
together again-- which
means you can walk

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:84%
through life from that
point on totally buzzed,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.155 align:middle line:90%
and stay buzzed.

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that essentially
is what you've done.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But you've constructed
really a very different life

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.067 align:middle line:84%
for yourself than
what most people live.

00:29:24.067 --> 00:29:25.525 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And
continue to do that.

00:29:25.525 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't stopped.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And it gets more complex.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'm enjoying the ride.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I know.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people, due
to vanity or whatnot,

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be labeled,
and certainly don't

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:90%
want to be dated.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But when we were at
lunch prior to this,

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I learned that
you're 73 years old.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And anybody listening and
watching right now would say,

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.384 align:middle line:90%
you have to be kidding.

00:29:49.384 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't look it.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.760 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel it.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.880 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing about
you that exudes anything

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.836 align:middle line:84%
that we would perceive
as 73 years old.

00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
you seem to be

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.470 align:middle line:84%
in this state of
constant self-creation.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Self-creation,
which produces life force.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.624 align:middle line:84%
I have the life force
of a 36-year-old.

00:30:08.624 --> 00:30:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So creating
the moments of your life

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to keep a person as healthy
and happy and full of mischief

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.710 align:middle line:84%
as you are right now is
really a conscious choice.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.020 align:middle line:90%
It took a lot of consciousness.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:84%
It took a lot of courage in
other parts of your life.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Even standing up and
having the, as you told us

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, your
other peers in the military

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:90%
even do these exercises.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:84%
That's wacko crazy
levels of courage.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean, putting yourself
up there for rejection.

00:30:34.425 --> 00:30:37.280 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:84%
If you can start painting a
portrait of what you're doing,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
what you're working toward,
because you have a bigger plan.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:44.195 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yes.

00:30:44.195 --> 00:30:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You see what
the future looks like.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.870 align:middle line:84%
How you would
construct that and how

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:54.690 align:middle line:84%
you think our probable outcome
as humanity is going to go.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And let's start
talking about that

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and moving forward as to
that, how we get there,

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:84%
what we're capable of, what it
takes within us to create it.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: I'm sure there have
been times when you've been,

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:14.400 align:middle line:84%
say, looking at a star-studded
night, or watch the ocean,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:84%
or watched some Olympians do
their thing, when you said,

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:90%
this is a miracle universe.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:90%
We are in miracle bodies.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
take responsibility

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:39.110 align:middle line:84%
to do something to
live up to that.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.455 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It happens a lot.

00:31:40.455 --> 00:31:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yes.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.621 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those
moments of perfection

00:31:42.621 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:90%
bring me to tears all the time.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: So we've
heard a lot you

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:84%
can't build the 21st century
with the 20th century

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.044 align:middle line:84%
thinking that brought you to
the place where you are now.

00:31:56.044 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: So 21st
century thinking.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:84%
If I want to step up, do I
step up only in one department?

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Or do I say I'm going to
step up in every department

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I can get my hands
on or I can imagine?

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.920 align:middle line:90%
And I just start doing it.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And it starts with
the book of Jim,

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:17.800 align:middle line:84%
where I make notes about what
I want to be and whatnot.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:84%
One way to boil it down is right
now, if you read anthropology,

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:28.000 align:middle line:84%
it says we've decided
we're Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're a man who thinks,
and man who thinks and thinks

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.250 align:middle line:90%
about how he thinks.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Well duh, that's
not enough for me.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Thinking is what lost
me my animal body.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I had to unthink to get back
in my body and feel something.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's just go to soma, add
the word soma or sentient.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, how about
Homo sentient sapiens?

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Homo soma sapiens.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:90%
And I want to evolve.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to get better than
I was the day before.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's the evo, evolutis.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:02.962 align:middle line:90%
That evolution.

00:33:02.962 --> 00:33:04.170 align:middle line:90%
We'll put that in there, too.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Evo soma sapiens sapiens.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And so it goes.

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:14.460 align:middle line:84%
The paranormal skills, I
want to be telempathic.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
telepathic because that just

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:84%
means you're wide open to the
whole broadcast all the time.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to be empathic
towards somebody

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.776 align:middle line:84%
and then be able to feel what
they feel, that sort of thing.

00:33:26.776 --> 00:33:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
a heart connection.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:84%
That would indicate
a heart connection.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Well, heart
connection is how it happens.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:90%
You have to go to your heart.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:84%
If you're not used to going
to your heart, bang, bang,

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:42.330 align:middle line:84%
If you aren't used to going to
your heart and sort of opening

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:48.310 align:middle line:84%
it up in a different way, I
sometimes imagine green light.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And I imagine my
heart is not a pump,

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:54.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually
four transmitters.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And I just made this all up
because I had a heart attack

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.310 align:middle line:84%
about three months ago and
I actually could feel this.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And then my psychic
friend said, well,

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:84%
you can now broadcast 4,000
miles with your thoughts

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:90%
when your heart is open.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:84%
I said, ooh, better check
out what I'm thinking.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But I would get telephone
calls from 4,000 miles

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.250 align:middle line:84%
after I would think
a certain thing.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.170 align:middle line:90%
So I know that's possible.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:27.639 align:middle line:84%
Hello, I just found that I'm
a Ferrari in the thinking

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:30.810 align:middle line:90%
and transmitting department.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But that's no different
than doing a full out

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.573 align:middle line:90%
breath every now and then.

00:34:38.573 --> 00:34:40.114 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: True, we
forget to breathe.

00:34:40.114 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Settle
the system down.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So there are like 10 or 12
things I check into all day

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.969 align:middle line:84%
long to keep myself tuned
up, relaxed, present,

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:84%
waiting for instructions,
because we live in the time

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.674 align:middle line:84%
when the other side
is coming to visit.

00:34:58.674 --> 00:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
what you mean by that.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:00.965 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yes.

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a tricky
one because some people,

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:09.120 align:middle line:84%
for instance, imagine that
they have a higher self.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes
they get information

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.370 align:middle line:90%
from their higher self.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe that they
have intuition, which usually

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.770 align:middle line:84%
comes out of stomach,
and they get information

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:18.990 align:middle line:90%
from the stomach.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And some people know
that they have dreams

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and somehow they have no right
to be seeing what they're

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:30.310 align:middle line:84%
seeing in the dream based on
the life they've already lived.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So they're connected
to the matrix, perhaps.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Notice that when I get on
a drive to do something,

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.460 align:middle line:84%
because I'm
task-oriented, you know.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm always on purpose.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.460 align:middle line:84%
But if the computer won't
work or the Wi-Fi's down

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and it happens more
than two minutes,

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.640 align:middle line:84%
I go whoa, something
better coming.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.005 align:middle line:84%
So you have to wait for that,
and calm down and feel good

00:35:58.005 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:90%
while you're waiting.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.550 align:middle line:90%
You know, amuse yourself.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe open some
channels, other channels,

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.020 align:middle line:84%
to see if there are any
more signals coming in.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.450 align:middle line:90%
The whole day goes like that.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I have four
hours of not knowing

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and 20 hours of pure pleasure
because what usually happens

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.680 align:middle line:84%
is just way better than
what I had imagined.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Simultaneously, I do vision for
very specific objective things.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I want a new
something on my land.

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to buy that darn
eucalyptus tree that I always

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:90%
wanted, you know?

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And that happens then.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:38.520 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I go to the store,
I see the word eucalyptus

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.850 align:middle line:84%
on the little
plant and I buy it.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's that
objective connection.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a
completely subjective world

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.030 align:middle line:90%
of this doesn't feel right now.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Now the feeling's
coming through.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Answer the phone.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Or don't answer the phone.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Or call that person you were
thinking of, but not right now.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
like flying in the cloud,

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:84%
the so-called cloud where all
our information is going to be.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And there are angels
in there and there're

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.520 align:middle line:90%
provocateurs in there.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Provocateurs are
called commonly demons.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.795 align:middle line:84%
And the demons are the
ones that nudge you

00:37:18.795 --> 00:37:23.160 align:middle line:84%
until you would do something
you don't want to do.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Moroccan
culture, they call it the jinn,

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:84%
for example, that can
disturb your environment.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Almost every culture
has that Shiva or the destroyer

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.810 align:middle line:90%
aspect.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you'll
engage with or just

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:84%
let the message kind of
flow through and not engage?

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with
that particular realm

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.670 align:middle line:90%
of the disturbers?

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: I pretend.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:54.790 align:middle line:90%
I play like I know this.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be just like a kid.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be the
captain of the ship now.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I charge in because I know
it's another illusion probably

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.070 align:middle line:84%
there for my benefit
from somewhere.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And I did that during
my heart attack.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I ran out and grabbed
my banyan tree.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know why I
was doing this exactly,

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:25.030 align:middle line:84%
but I let this Don
Quixote guy loose.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And I said take out the dark.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
The banyan tree-- And then
I fell into the ground,

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:90%
in the mud, and I did a thing.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And then I got up.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, I saw
a big umbilical cord

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.890 align:middle line:90%
coming down from the sky.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And I screwed that into
the earth because it looked

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:84%
like a nurturing force and some
fluid would come or something.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
the winds around me

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:84%
went to 60 miles an hour,
all around the tree.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Not in the tree, but
all around the tree.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.970 align:middle line:84%
We're in touch with
some world here.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is my belief
that planet Earth

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:14.580 align:middle line:84%
is about to move into a phase
where everything's coming,

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.589 align:middle line:90%
not something's coming.

00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.074 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:39:21.074 --> 00:39:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And the everything
is just-- part

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:28.420 align:middle line:84%
of that's getting subtle
signals from different places,

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
having your own ideas
based on your dreams.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.910 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty polyphonic.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And the intelligence you
need to deal with that

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.190 align:middle line:90%
is the polymath intelligence.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:43.190 align:middle line:84%
In Greek, poly means
many, math means facets.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So this whole business
of looking at your kids

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and saying what do you want
to be when you grow up,

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.635 align:middle line:84%
their answer needs to
be everything I can.

00:39:51.635 --> 00:39:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And so the answer
is not project manager.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, they took away
all the fun jobs-- adventurer,

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.263 align:middle line:90%
explorer.

00:40:00.263 --> 00:40:00.888 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:00.888 --> 00:40:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, I'm preparing
a thoughtful understanding

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.640 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence
we're going to need

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.700 align:middle line:84%
to produce the 21st
century that we want.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And the 21st
century that we want

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.620 align:middle line:84%
is one where our
biosphere is cleaned up.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, who's available?

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Turns out the military's
available for that job,

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.620 align:middle line:84%
provided we don't get
tricked into sending them

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:84%
off protecting
somebody else's supply

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.543 align:middle line:90%
lines or something like that.

00:40:32.543 --> 00:40:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And I've worked
with 230 general officer

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.220 align:middle line:84%
candidates for
three star generals,

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.200 align:middle line:84%
meaning they've already worked
in the Army for 20 or 15 years,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.810 align:middle line:90%
and they've already been tabbed.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.270 align:middle line:90%
And I get to talk to them.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The Army invites me
to speak to them.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is ongoing?

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.464 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: At this
moment, the Afghan War

00:40:52.464 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:84%
has taken the money
away for that.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, OK.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: But it was still--

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:55.903 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:55.903 --> 00:41:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: 2000 through 2004,
230 general officer candidates,

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:84%
men, women from nine nations,
all four branches of service.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And the exercise in the room
was restore the biosphere.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Think of every military
resource you've ever used.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Apply it to the solution.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Armies making designer forests
with delicate watershed

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:23.750 align:middle line:84%
projects, using teenagers from
high schools to make it up.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Playing music while
they're doing it.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Navies protecting
overfishing, moving hatcheries

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.870 align:middle line:84%
into the right place, bringing
all the flotsam and jetsam

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.090 align:middle line:84%
into the gyre, you know, where
it can be turned back into oil

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:38.970 align:middle line:84%
again with a little
heat or something

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.250 align:middle line:90%
intelligent like that.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.390 align:middle line:84%
The Marines, who have all
the shoreline vehicles,

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:49.220 align:middle line:84%
get to repair the waterways
and protect the coral reefs.

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force
does sensor work

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:54.210 align:middle line:84%
from up above, where they
monitor all the pollution,

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.980 align:middle line:84%
print it out, put it on the
daily news, weather, and sports

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.890 align:middle line:84%
programs, so everybody can
see who's making the mess.

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And also by having
these huge cargo

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.480 align:middle line:84%
planes take a complete--
rescue villages

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.780 align:middle line:84%
to places on the planet
that are in need of that.

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It goes on.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.440 align:middle line:90%
There are jobs for kids.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.690 align:middle line:84%
The high school
kids, I think, are

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.440 align:middle line:84%
perfect for helping
with the forest.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.370 align:middle line:84%
The college kids are
helping with the seed banks

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:90%
lets us have public seed banks.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And the college kids are
perfect because they're

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.410 align:middle line:84%
at this age of sorting
and classifying.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Middle school kids are
putting new combinations

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.700 align:middle line:90%
of surplus materials together.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And the grade school kids
are collecting all the stuff,

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:45.260 align:middle line:90%
you know, in wagons and whatnot.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So it goes over into
all the categories

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:51.080 align:middle line:84%
of people on planet Earth
that are not actively employed

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.760 align:middle line:84%
in some really
important activity.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out we
have a huge workforce

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:84%
to right the biosphere,
to resettle the forests.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And I say any of the younger
kids that get out of school

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and don't get a job, and
they have a college degree,

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.100 align:middle line:90%
then they're doing it now.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:84%
They're going into the
forests and they're

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.270 align:middle line:84%
building tropical
oases, where they

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.630 align:middle line:84%
can do their neo-tribal
dances and whatnot,

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and also help the old
farmer down the road who's

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.890 align:middle line:84%
60 plus years old and
can't keep his small farm.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Re-energizing the small farms.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.434 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful move.

00:43:32.434 --> 00:43:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And that means that
all local communities will

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.360 align:middle line:84%
have the capacity to feed-- at
least put half the food they

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.880 align:middle line:90%
need on the table.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.390 align:middle line:84%
They can get the other
half from agrobusiness.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.520 align:middle line:84%
But half the food is fresh
and it's on the table.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.700 align:middle line:90%
And it comes from their doing.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a
little preachy here,

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:57.240 align:middle line:84%
but I don't see anybody in
the 21st century benefiting

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:01.890 align:middle line:84%
from not having a personal
relationship with nature.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the
10-foot-long lettuce garden.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.920 align:middle line:90%
It's real involvement.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from the soil
to the artesian levels,

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole indigenous
microorganism world

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that can get activated with
the right kinds of water.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:21.300 align:middle line:84%
There's the biopsychic
world going over the trees.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Once you get enough trees to
a certain level, they bond.

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:26.880 align:middle line:90%
They lock together.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.080 align:middle line:90%
They trust each other.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.180 align:middle line:90%
They carry.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.560 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability
to keep the moisture

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.100 align:middle line:90%
level at the one they want.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I never have a yellow
leaf in my bioforest.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And I communicate
with my living trees.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:46.050 align:middle line:84%
If I fertilized
them the day before,

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.690 align:middle line:90%
they'll do a wind dance for me.

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I have trees and
bushes that are picked

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.700 align:middle line:84%
because they move
in certain ways.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:59.150 align:middle line:84%
They're picked because they
make certain sounds, surging

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:01.010 align:middle line:90%
sound, lifeforce sounds.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They're picked because their
leaf shapes are different.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.680 align:middle line:84%
They're picked because they hold
water so sun can reflect in it

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and make reflective
bubbles all around.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And I have 57 of those
friends right around my porch.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And in my porch I have
a swing that moves me.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.910 align:middle line:84%
It feels like I'm
in a treehouse.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have 27 things
in my view plane.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.860 align:middle line:90%
This is social architecture.

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.370 align:middle line:84%
From the volcano at the end of
my view plane, to the clouds,

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:32.740 align:middle line:84%
back to the blue channel,
back to the little town,

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.120 align:middle line:84%
back to the wind
generators, all the way back

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to where I'm sitting
are specifically planted

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.820 align:middle line:84%
pieces of nature
that have a certain--

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.370 align:middle line:90%
it's like a flower arrangement.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I need a light color here
and I need a stiff, darker

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.070 align:middle line:84%
color there, and I need
some taller ones here.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I put seven kinds
of birdseed in front of me

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:58.554 align:middle line:90%
and seven kinds birds show up.

00:45:58.554 --> 00:45:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
like paradise.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: We can make it.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.814 align:middle line:84%
Paradise is just a
great landscaping job.

00:46:04.814 --> 00:46:07.730 align:middle line:84%
In heaven, it's trusting
all this other weird stuff

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that's coming in and
playing the game.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Play the game with God.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you speak
about, to create paradise,

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.854 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a
paradise mindset.

00:46:18.854 --> 00:46:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not
going to create paradise

00:46:21.395 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:84%
if you're worrying about
feeding your family.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: That's right.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
gets us to issues

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.310 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the
economy right now,

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and how you're
seeing that play out.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:84%
How do you see where we
are now being transformed

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.310 align:middle line:84%
into the vision that you
just shared with us, which

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:41.640 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely beautiful, and for
all intents and purposes quite

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.350 align:middle line:90%
doable.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:45.390 align:middle line:84%
But not when all this money
that should be feeding people

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.820 align:middle line:84%
is being allocated toward the
military industrial complex.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.380 align:middle line:90%
How does this happen?

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Well, when I
look at the whole planet,

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.150 align:middle line:84%
what I see-- and Hazel
Henderson helped me with this.

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:00.110 align:middle line:90%
She's a hotshot economist.

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And she said 65% of everything
that's done or made or fixed

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:10.910 align:middle line:84%
or boiled or fried or
combed is done for love.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So if the economy is really
about swapping services

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:23.100 align:middle line:84%
of a human kind for the
reward of being loved,

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.785 align:middle line:84%
this money thing is
way out of proportion.

00:47:25.785 --> 00:47:28.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a big fat story.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:31.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like government
is a big fat story.

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Government hasn't done anything
very useful in a long time.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And the web is
outperforming the government

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:41.610 align:middle line:84%
in providing the infosphere
for decision-making

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:44.260 align:middle line:90%
by all the people.

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.450 align:middle line:84%
All the voters are
getting to do what

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.120 align:middle line:84%
they need to do,
find what they need

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.740 align:middle line:84%
to find much better
because of the web.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Not because their congressman
gave them a storefront

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.250 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So this whole business of value,
and where the money really

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:84%
needs to be, and how many
services there have to be that

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:08.300 align:middle line:84%
need to be paid for--
like transportation.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.410 align:middle line:90%
There's some real things.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Borders are just
getting us in trouble.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:17.130 align:middle line:84%
We just saw the Olympics, where
borders didn't mean anything.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that's
the oldest meeting

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:23.240 align:middle line:84%
that human beings have with each
other that isn't necessarily

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.920 align:middle line:90%
about territory.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.779 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And war.

00:48:25.779 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: And war.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, and the war
comes from territory.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.961 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON:You took my--
And you might blow me--

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.190 align:middle line:90%
all of that world.

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So the public consciousness
now is so strong as a culture.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.060 align:middle line:90%
We have a global culture.

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.280 align:middle line:90%
We eat the same food.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.220 align:middle line:90%
We play the same music.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.400 align:middle line:90%
We dress the same way.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.000 align:middle line:84%
You can go from one
city to the other

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and you're just
hard-pressed to find

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:52.190 align:middle line:90%
anything completely original.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I did find the other
day two Muslim people

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in a Chinese rickshaw
in London going

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:04.710 align:middle line:84%
to have their feet nibbled
by fish in a Thai salon.

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, how damn
integrated do we need--

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.173 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
a multicultural.

00:49:08.173 --> 00:49:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: How polycultural
do we need to get here?

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the mythology
that comes from big cities,

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and it comes from
bankers and whatnot,

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.780 align:middle line:84%
is very calculated to
keep us in their game.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And they can gamble
if they want to.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how
they do their lives.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.640 align:middle line:90%
They're taking too much.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.720 align:middle line:90%
And we can walk away from that.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.960 align:middle line:84%
The web, we can walk
away from government,

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.920 align:middle line:90%
we can walk away from banks.

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.760 align:middle line:90%
We know how to trade for love.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.180 align:middle line:90%
And we know what service is.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And service is what gets love.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So it may sound
slightly melodramatic,

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:56.600 align:middle line:84%
but I have a great feeling
the whole mythology

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.870 align:middle line:84%
of all that is just
going to go away.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:03.280 align:middle line:84%
It's going to crumble
up like burning paper.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of people are
feeling that and also seeing

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.259 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:50:06.259 --> 00:50:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yes.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And those of them who
have moved to the country

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and wake up every morning with
a full nose full of flora,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and lie in the soft, sweet
grass in the afternoon,

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the wind while
they're having dinner instead

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:30.190 align:middle line:84%
of TV, they're pretty close
to past paradise and close

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.950 align:middle line:90%
to heaven.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:31.942 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:31.942 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So we have to still tiptoe
through, or get a spade out,

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:43.620 align:middle line:84%
help turn the soil as it were,
metaphorically, spiritually,

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:49.180 align:middle line:84%
physically, to allow the
old structures to just fall

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.270 align:middle line:84%
under their own
weight, are you saying?

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Just unplug and let
them do what they

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.890 align:middle line:84%
need to do while
we create the new?

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Hasn't it
always been like that?

00:50:58.410 --> 00:50:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And the part
that people don't quite get

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:06.580 align:middle line:84%
is that the old pieces
are not destroyed,

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.770 align:middle line:90%
they're just unpacked.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:11.364 align:middle line:84%
And they go together
in new combinations.

00:51:11.364 --> 00:51:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like the military.

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Exactly.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The repurposing of
the military you're speaking of,

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.890 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And the
military in 1918

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:20.960 align:middle line:84%
was stocking trout in the
Yosemite National Forest

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.590 align:middle line:90%
and building trails.

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:25.290 align:middle line:90%
See, there's a cycle here.

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:27.895 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't
dishonorable in any way.

00:51:27.895 --> 00:51:30.820 align:middle line:90%


00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And gosh, I so hope there's
still the requisite amount

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:38.420 align:middle line:84%
of challenges for
every human being,

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:43.380 align:middle line:84%
as we are made, to make hard
decisions about their life

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.520 align:middle line:90%
and grow from it.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And that seems built in.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the hero's
journey is built

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.575 align:middle line:84%
into upping for a
life on this planet.

00:51:50.575 --> 00:51:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: It's true.

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And so pretend you're a
hero and get in the game.

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Speaking of game,
what is Project Earthrise?

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Well,
that was consciously

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.800 align:middle line:84%
collecting 80 fellows of the
World Business Academy, which

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:10.840 align:middle line:84%
included women, fellows
notwithstanding, and saying

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.990 align:middle line:84%
what are the best
ideas for planet

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Earth of a positive
nature for the future?

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.070 align:middle line:90%


00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:21.280 align:middle line:84%
We worked on that
for eight years,

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.209 align:middle line:84%
and we published something that
can be found on YouTube now.

00:52:25.209 --> 00:52:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It goes by that name?

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:27.285 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Project Eartrise.

00:52:27.285 --> 00:52:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And there
are other things

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:28.867 align:middle line:90%
called Project Earthrise.

00:52:28.867 --> 00:52:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do we do
distinguish this one?

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: World
Business Academy.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:32.291 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: World Business.

00:52:32.291 --> 00:52:32.985 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: WBA.

00:52:32.985 --> 00:52:36.760 align:middle line:90%
WBA, Project Earthrise.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what did
you come to as a group?

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Well, the
superordinate goal

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:44.780 align:middle line:84%
that was given to us
by Robert Muller, who

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:48.130 align:middle line:84%
used to be the deputy
undersecretary of the United

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Nations, a German man, was
to see the Earth as qualified

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.050 align:middle line:90%
to be paradise.

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:58.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the mindset.

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:01.660 align:middle line:84%
We just see her, as
she is, perfectly

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:04.850 align:middle line:90%
qualified to be paradise.

00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
global public voice,

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:10.010 align:middle line:90%
and we're not quite there.

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The Olympics was, in a
sense, the world of people

00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:18.610 align:middle line:84%
talking to the
world, but not quite.

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Really, we think the
only way we can talk

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:21.874 align:middle line:90%
is through governments.

00:53:21.874 --> 00:53:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.014 align:middle line:84%
It still had that
propagandist overlay to it.

00:53:25.014 --> 00:53:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yeah.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's perfectly
normal because when

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.335 align:middle line:84%
you're building something, you
do have to start with clumps.

00:53:31.335 --> 00:53:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before you can fashion
them into something beautiful.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: That's right.

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.740 align:middle line:90%


00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So I think at the secret part,
at the source part of all this,

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:56.740 align:middle line:84%
is that if we see our soul
with the same level of awe

00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and respect that we see
the galaxy, and the Earth,

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and the forest, we'll come
to a place to love ourselves

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.290 align:middle line:90%
not just because we say so.

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I have the t-shirt,
I love myself.

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to love yourself
like you were the baby

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:23.800 align:middle line:84%
child in your own arms,
and wait until you feel it.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that,
there is this business

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.470 align:middle line:90%
of knowing you're divine.

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:33.280 align:middle line:84%
We're part of the
universe that's sparkly

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and the trees that are
waving and whatnot.

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:44.320 align:middle line:84%
No better, no worse, but no
less-- naughty, miserable

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.020 align:middle line:90%
sinners.

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't like that one.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Checked out on Sunday
School a long time ago.

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: It may have worked
in the century it was invented.

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.010 align:middle line:84%
But no, everybody
has the capacity

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:58.440 align:middle line:84%
to find their divinity,
and their soul,

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and walk around in
it, and feel it.

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not feeling right,
take a minute and hook it up.

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think people
are so intrigued with others

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.580 align:middle line:84%
who have kind of
gone before them

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and have had the courage to
enter into this kind of a life.

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yes.

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we only
have a couple minutes left.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:20.350 align:middle line:90%
And time has just whizzed by.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Leave us with your vision
of what we as a species

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:25.589 align:middle line:90%
are becoming.

00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:26.880 align:middle line:90%
We've got two or three minutes.

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Would it be
weird if I actually--

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.214 align:middle line:90%
two or three minutes.

00:55:29.214 --> 00:55:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I get
into the space where

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I try to summarize for
myself where am I now

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:40.250 align:middle line:84%
after studying all
these different options

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and putting them together--
and I have something

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on here.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I'll read it.

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Butt in if you want.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: "'The Millennium
Comes.' We accept that

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.640 align:middle line:90%
the global age has arrived.

00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:01.000 align:middle line:84%
The global age, not the
post-industrial age.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And that we are one culturally
bonded global people.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.580 align:middle line:84%
When John Lennon said
what he said at the end

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Olympics, the song--
sang 'Imagine,' that was

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.640 align:middle line:90%
the benediction for the planet.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.690 align:middle line:84%
We organize our future
using the information

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:90%
economy of the World Wide Web.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the information
exchange that's rich.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not the dollars that are
crossing that does the work.

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Governments decentralize into
bioregional support centers.

00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:37.120 align:middle line:84%
We repair our biosphere
using the military resources

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.970 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:42.690 align:middle line:84%
We create global villages
that are multiethnic

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and grow half the food they
need to eat nearby, fresh.

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We integrate the
industrial matrix

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:53.710 align:middle line:84%
with nature's
natural power grid."

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:56.042 align:middle line:90%
Nature has a power grid.

00:56:56.042 --> 00:56:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're talking
free energy there, essentially?

00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Yes, all of that.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The new
technologies, yes.

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:04.436 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: And the partnership
with nature is not an option.

00:57:04.436 --> 00:57:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: No, that's real.

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:07.260 align:middle line:90%
That has to happen.

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:10.206 align:middle line:90%
Everybody, everybody.

00:57:10.206 --> 00:57:12.260 align:middle line:84%
A little green hat,
a little green coat.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:18.600 align:middle line:84%
"We accept the aquarian
mandate to make fresh water

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.770 align:middle line:90%
the new gold standard.

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:24.860 align:middle line:84%
We open our minds to the new
inner dimensional realities

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that are emerging,
including soul awakening.

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.860 align:middle line:84%
We invite galactic support
for our continued ascension."

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they're up there.

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:38.530 align:middle line:84%
They will wait till we're
grown-up enough to talk to.

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:40.860 align:middle line:84%
We haven't even made
a front door for them

00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:43.160 align:middle line:90%
to come in and land.

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:47.300 align:middle line:84%
"We see our-- ever more clearly
the golden age is in sight."

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.630 align:middle line:90%
We know what the golden age is.

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:51.340 align:middle line:84%
We've had books about
that all our lives.

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.710 align:middle line:84%
"We acknowledge that our planet
is qualified to be paradise.

00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:59.660 align:middle line:84%
We begin with love
and lifeforce living,

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:04.620 align:middle line:84%
knowing that levity works
just as well as gravity

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and that we can always
ask for what we want.

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:11.274 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, God."

00:58:11.274 --> 00:58:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That says it all.

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.220 align:middle line:90%
That says it all.

00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:14.970 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:16.116 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: I
apologize for reading.

00:58:16.116 --> 00:58:16.615 align:middle line:90%
You see--

00:58:16.615 --> 00:58:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is nirvana.

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:19.210 align:middle line:90%
The book of Jim.

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: The book of Jim.

00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're painting a
picture of nirvana for us.

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to each one
of us to choose that.

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: Yes, in
the amounts you like.

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
amounts we like.

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, have
you any final thought

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:33.080 align:middle line:90%
before we sign off?

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for
being here with me.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANNON: To all
those men and women

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:41.810 align:middle line:84%
in the industrial military,
industrial complex

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:46.840 align:middle line:84%
who built the world of the last
century-- all the bridges, all

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:50.290 align:middle line:84%
the airports, all the depots,
all the communications

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:53.130 align:middle line:84%
devices, the thing
that made us all

00:58:53.130 --> 00:59:01.080 align:middle line:84%
be able to come to the
Olympics-- thank you.

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.347 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And thank you.

00:59:02.347 --> 00:59:03.305 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANNON: Now move on.

00:59:03.305 --> 00:59:05.970 align:middle line:90%


00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It's only by agreement
of the population

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.550 align:middle line:84%
that such sweeping
changes can occur.

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But this kind of
model does give hope.

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:16.960 align:middle line:84%

Until next time, thank you for
