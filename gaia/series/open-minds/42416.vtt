>>Michael?

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Michael?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Are, are you coming down, dear?

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Be right down.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Just got to find my smokes.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>They're beside the bed
next to my Cortisone.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Did you find them?

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.920 align:middle line:90%
He'll be down directly.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>[GROANING]

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Look, who are you?

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:90%
I told you, George.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.969 align:middle line:90%
I'm your guardian angel.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, yeah.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.926 align:middle line:90%
You told me that.

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:90%
What else are you?

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:90%
What are you-- you a hypnotist?

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>No, of course not.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.904 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, then why am I seeing
all these strange things here?

00:01:34.904 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH:
Two wonderful films,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
clips from "Michael" and
"It's a Wonderful Life."

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
How often have we
felt lost and alone

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and unable to make a decision,
like in the film with James

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Stewart?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people reach such a state
of despondency and hopelessness

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.594 align:middle line:84%
that they choose
to end their lives.

00:01:49.594 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
What if the answers
to whatever you need

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
are right alongside
or within you?

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, they are.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Tom Moore has been working with
his team of guardian angels

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
for many years, and
he says life begins

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to take on miraculous
proportions in doing so.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.760 align:middle line:84%
But you have to have
the courage to ask.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big problem
with us earthlings.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes we don't feel
worthy for some reason

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:84%
of asking for help, not
even on the big things,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:90%
no less the little things.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So we have this illusion
that we're alone,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and this creates
a burden of life.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about how you first

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:84%
came in contact with
your guardian angel.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>> TOM MOORE: Ah.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It was about 17
years ago, and I had

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
been reading articles
in a magazine

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
by the name of "The Sedona
Journal of Emergence."

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And these were
spiritual-type articles.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the articles
by Robert Shapiro,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
he was channeling,
which I call telepathy,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
a being who told him
that you could request

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:84%
benevolent outcomes
in your life.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, hmm, that's
kind of interesting.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I've always been sort of
like out there experimenting

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.277 align:middle line:84%
and testing things,
the Law of Attraction

00:03:04.277 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:84%
all these other things
that have come a long, long

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
before it was called
the Law of Attraction,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:84%
where you were supposed
to just imagine things.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So I started
experimenting with it,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
really what I was doing.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But I started with
little, small requests

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.106 align:middle line:90%
for like a parking space.

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's kind of
the entry point for a lot

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
of people, talking to
the parking faeries.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.732 align:middle line:84%
Or as some people call
it, my parking angel.

00:03:32.732 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: OK.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:90%
But these little simple things.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And I found it was
working perfectly.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I was really,
really amazed at that.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And slowly but surely, I started
asking bigger and bigger things

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and including it in
my business life.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the international film
and TV distribution business,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
so I use it all time
in my own business.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can request benevolent
outcomes for every single thing

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing in your life.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And basically what happens,
as I've come to learn,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
is that you're turning
this over to what

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.660 align:middle line:90%
I believe is my guardian angel.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But if someone wants to believe
it's God or Allah or a Hindu

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
deity or Buddha,
it doesn't matter,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.270 align:middle line:90%
because it works perfectly.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you're turning it
over to them and saying,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:84%
is this request in my
best short-term interest

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:90%
and long-term interest?

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, please
honor my request.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.122 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And it's amazing the
things that come to you when

00:04:46.122 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:84%
you start requesting
benevolent outcomes.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And just to get a little
more esoteric, because I

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:84%
find it really interesting, and
some information that I came

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
across somewhere along the
way in the last few decades

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:90%
researching all of this.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the
human species is really

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.260 align:middle line:84%
one of the few species that
even uses guides or angels

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
for the simple reason that, as
you and I have spoken before,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.387 align:middle line:90%
we're called a veiled species.

00:05:12.387 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're this
explorer kind of species.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: We're the
only veiled species.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So we have issues with really
understanding who we are.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:84%
We're veiled from our own
magnificence of our own souls,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
our souls' journeys
and so forth.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And because of that kind
of amnesia, so to speak,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
we need the help
of others who are

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
able to operate in these
other subdimensional fields

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:90%
to be able to assist us.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And also you were
talking about the names

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:90%
by which we call that source.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's ourselves.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
It's our own higher
selves that are also

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
coming to our aid, which we have
no knowledge of for the most

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.266 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I just wanted
to add that little piece

00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in because there is a
magnificent network of unseen

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
beings that are literally
here to assist humanity.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:90%
That's their job.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.716 align:middle line:90%
And we don't call on them.

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And as I was to
eventually find out,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:84%
what we call guardian
angels are whole souls.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But they're such
ancient souls that they

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:90%
emanate a golden light.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they're called
golden light beings.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And there was a call
that our creator

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
made that went out all
over different universes

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:90%
for these beings.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And as Theo, my
guardian angel says,

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
he jokingly said, the
job description was only

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.656 align:middle line:90%
golden light beings need apply.

00:06:42.656 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Because this work
they do is extremely difficult.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're not only
handling our souls

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.185 align:middle line:84%
but thousands of other
souls all at the same time.

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Can you imagine?

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get
through and help someone

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.017 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't even know they
exist and never asks for help.

00:07:01.017 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.016 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
must that be like,

00:07:03.016 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
in terms of levels
of frustration,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:90%
trying to find a way--

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: They don't
have frustration.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --to
get through to us?

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.536 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: They don't
have frustration.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.250 align:middle line:90%
I get what you're saying.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a
special kind of being

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
to be able to stand up
to that energetically.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why they had to be
extremely experienced in order

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.611 align:middle line:84%
to do this, because they're
handling all of our lives

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%
that we'll ever have on Earth.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Because time is an illusion,
and all of our lives

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:84%
are taking place
at the same time.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And each of these lives
has 12 parallel lives

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:90%
going on at the same time.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So they're taking
care of all of those.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And it just kind of multiplies
into infinity almost.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.782 align:middle line:84%
And as Theo has told
me, they're busy guys.

00:07:48.782 --> 00:07:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're very busy.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But we have a mass
inferiority complex.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
We put everything that seems to
have supernatural capabilities

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
far above and beyond what we
are as humans, not understanding

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that we are a
magnificent species,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and we're doing the hard
work in the trenches.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:90%
We need the help.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So what have you been told
or taught by your guides

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.810 align:middle line:84%
about why we feel so unworthy
to even ask for help?

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Well, it's
because we're veiled.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's this doubting,
doubting everything.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.524 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Fear.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: --when
you have this fear,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and also keep in mind
there's religious training.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
religions that

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:84%
teach you can only ask your
clergymen, whatever type

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
of clergymen, priest,
whatever that happens to be.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:90%
You have to go through them.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.530 align:middle line:84%
You were not worthy to
be able to communicate

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:90%
with an angel or God yourself.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And so many, many
people grow up believing

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that they're very
unworthy, and they

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
don't understand that these
golden light beings are

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
so powerful that, as
I explain to people,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
they could handle 2 million
requests for a parking space

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.002 align:middle line:84%
at the same time and
not break a sweat.

00:09:16.002 --> 00:09:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: It's nothing to them.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.643 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And they will joyfully
help you, but you have to ask.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.170 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the rules.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask
for the assistance.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.641 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
thing I really like

00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:84%
about the way your work puts
it is what you said earlier,

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
looking for the terminology
the most benevolent outcome.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And tell us why asking for
the most benevolent outcome

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
became really such a
kind of switch for you.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Oh.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, when I
was experimenting with this,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I was saying, OK, I request
a benevolent outcome.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
But then I wanted to abbreviate
it, and I requested BO.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.138 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't sound very good.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:57.846 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:09:57.846 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: OK.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So I changed it to most
benevolent outcome,

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:90%
because you could say MBO.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And also I was told by
my own guardian angel

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:84%
later, years later,
that if someone

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
has a problem in pronouncing
the word benevolent--

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
because benevolent
17 years ago was not

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
a word that was
used that often, OK?

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
It's come into our language
more frequently now,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:84%
but there are still
people that have

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:84%
a problem in
pronouncing the word.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've been told that
if someone wants just

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to say I request
an MBO, they know.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.255 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly what
the person is asking for.

00:10:44.255 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: They don't have to
say benevolent if they don't--

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.743 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:10:47.743 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:90%
So an MBO.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:90%
We want an MBO out of this.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.327 align:middle line:84%
But you have to hold the
intent very clear in your mind.

00:10:52.327 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there's
someone you wrote about--

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and we dialogued a little bit
about this before you came here

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
for this interview about
whether to talk about Alphonse.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I wanted
to talk about Alphonse

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:84%
is because even if you don't
request help they're there.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.825 align:middle line:84%
And they're often there in very
extreme circumstances for us.

00:11:10.825 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Absolutely.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about Alphonse.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.354 align:middle line:84%
He was like a walking
disaster his whole life.

00:11:17.354 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And the things that happened
to him, because if that's not

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
inspirational I
don't know what is.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And Alphonse, I happened
to mention to him--

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:84%
he was in the film
industry, like I am, OK?

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And when he heard
that I was going

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to do this book-- I happened
to mention it at one of the TV

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.250 align:middle line:84%
markets in Cannes,
France-- he came over.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Tom, you gotta interview me.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:90%
I got all these stories.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:90%
You gotta hear these.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's how
Alphonse came to be.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And Alphonse just had all these
amazing instances where his

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:84%
life was literally about to
go off 1,000-foot cliff or off

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:13.270 align:middle line:84%
the side of a ship in the middle
of a storm and miraculously was

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:13.880 align:middle line:90%
saved.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how we
look at guardian angels,

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.467 align:middle line:84%
that they kind of show up
at these amazing times--

00:12:20.467 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: These critical times.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.008 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: --these critical
times and take care of us.

00:12:24.008 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:84%
But they are more than willing
to handle the littlest request

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to
the big request,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:90%
but you just have to ask.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Just have to ask.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's this
interesting thing.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about
Alphonse, and these

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.540 align:middle line:84%
were all life-threatening
situations.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.982 align:middle line:84%
And every one, how he came
out of that a movie should

00:12:42.982 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:84%
be made about the nine
lives of Alphonse.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was
pretty amazing.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But I am reminded of
this from a conversation

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I had at the airport a couple
days ago with my favorite TSA

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.900 align:middle line:90%
agent, a woman named Chris.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
When she's there, I'm
totally cool with TSA.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:90%
I just adore her.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.045 align:middle line:84%
And she had a minute or two
and told me this little story,

00:13:04.045 --> 00:13:05.545 align:middle line:84%
and I'm bringing
it up for a reason.

00:13:05.545 --> 00:13:08.099 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I said, you looked sad
last time I saw you.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And she said my mother
had just passed away.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And then she told me that
her father, who was also 92,

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:90%
is still alive.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I know
you like weird stuff.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
this little story.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Her father was a
pilot in World War II.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And his plane, he had
his sweetheart's name--

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:84%
her name was Mildred
or something.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Millie B,
something like that-- written

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the aircraft.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
He flew it, no
problems, no problems.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Right toward the end of
the war, the Millie B

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:90%
was finally shot down.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So it was strafed right
near the name Millie B

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:90%
on the 28th of September.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was 1944,
but it was nearing the end.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:90%
No one died.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:90%
They parachuted out.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Some became POWs.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But they lived all those
years together after that,

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and she, Millie,
died on September 28.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those
things that reminded me

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:84%
we have these guardian angels
that pull people like Alphonse

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
out of one ridiculous situation
after another, where he should

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:90%
have died many times over.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're taking
all these vitamins,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
doing everything we can
to preserve our lives.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
it appears there's

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:84%
something very gracious
about the time we're

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
given on Earth, that we have
sort of an expiration date.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.145 align:middle line:84%
Our number's not up
till our number's up.

00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:28.881 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:14:28.881 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they're there
to see to it that if you're not

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:90%
to go, you're not to go.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And also,
on the other hand,

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:84%
a guardian angel is to make
sure that, as an example,

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.792 align:middle line:84%
if your life is supposed to
end on a certain day in an auto

00:14:42.792 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:84%
wreck or whatever
it happens to be,

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.725 align:middle line:84%
they guide you to be
there at that second.

00:14:47.725 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.891 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: OK.

00:14:48.891 --> 00:14:51.247 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of their
job is to make sure--

00:14:51.247 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you
meet your contracts?

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
wonderful photos

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:84%
even that people have
caught of guardian angels

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:84%
at the site of really
horrific car wrecks

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.474 align:middle line:84%
where people have passed
over to the next dimension.

00:15:04.474 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:05.973 align:middle line:90%
And I've asked Theo.

00:15:05.973 --> 00:15:09.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, have you materialized?

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Because he's never
had a physical life.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
about golden light beings.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
any physical lives.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
It was at a time with a train
wreck where he became physical

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and was there to help not only
his charge but some others

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and then disappeared.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're a fan of
Robert Shapiro's work.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned him
a little bit ago.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things he talks about

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
is also requesting more
benevolent outcomes

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.170 align:middle line:84%
for more benevolent
companions and people

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that we travel with
through our own lives.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
this is really big.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It's thought that a lot
of what goes wrong in life

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
is by our choice
of associations.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Sure.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And keep in mind, obviously some
of these are soul contracts.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.324 align:middle line:84%
Because people come into your
life to give you challenges.

00:16:09.324 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:10.823 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:16:10.823 --> 00:16:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And you can't be
a good person in every life.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:90%
It's like a theater company.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:84%
In one life, you're the hero or
heroine, and in another life,

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:90%
you're the bad guy.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.899 align:middle line:84%
So it all has to
balance out at the end.

00:16:29.899 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Learning
through extremes.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what humanity does.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Learning
through extremes.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.682 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.682 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:84%
These are things
that you can learn

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.010 align:middle line:90%
to ask for benevolent people.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And as an example, if someone
is looking for someone to marry,

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:84%
they could say, I request
a most benevolent outcome

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:90%
for the perfect mate for me.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.546 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that doesn't
necessarily have a hassle-free

00:17:04.546 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:90%
guarantee in it.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.347 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: No.

00:17:06.347 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
learning from each other.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:84%
But it will be the
perfect mate for you.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:84%
But when you ask
for something, don't

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:84%
expect-- I've
actually gotten emails

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:84%
from people that are reading
my newsletters or whatever,

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and they said, Tom, you know,
I requested benevolent outcome

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.407 align:middle line:84%
for a man, and it's been a month
and he hasn't shown up yet.

00:17:27.407 --> 00:17:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Might need to
be a little more patient.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes, exactly.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:30.985 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:17:30.985 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: You've
got to be patient.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask for a benevolent
outcome for the perfect house.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I've got
a story for you there.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:40.861 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: OK.

00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:42.920 align:middle line:90%
And the perfect job for you.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So there are many things
that are much more important

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in your life than,
obviously, a parking space.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.894 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
that it's going to take time.

00:17:54.894 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: These things
take time to manifest.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And that's why I tell
people start with the mundane

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
requests, a seat on a bus or
a train or the parking space

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it happens to be
that's mundane that you get

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.845 align:middle line:90%
immediate feedback.

00:18:08.845 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And that way
you start trusting.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You build confidence.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.985 align:middle line:90%
You build confidence.

00:18:12.985 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:90%
You start trusting on it.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you can move on
up to the bigger things,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.606 align:middle line:84%
knowing full well that
it's going to work.

00:18:20.606 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to have that confidence
that it's there for you.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And requesting
benevolent outcomes is

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
the first and only modality
I've ever found that worked

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Even when you think
it didn't, you

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
find out a year or
two later it did.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's the critical part.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:90%
This takes a long-term view.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing with
non-physical beings.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Time and space doesn't
look the same to them.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.642 align:middle line:84%
What could take 10 years
looks like a blink to them.

00:18:50.642 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
that's, again, where

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.474 align:middle line:84%
we have to remember
the patience.

00:18:53.474 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And because you brought
this house thing,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you
my house story.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:57.511 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: OK.

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a
wonderful story.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So I was on vacation, just
a little brief vacation

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:84%
in Sedona, not planning
on moving there

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.468 align:middle line:84%
and thought, well,
I'll just look around.

00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one day way later
I'll want to move there.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:90%
And a realtor took me around.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I saw the back of this house,
and it wasn't the front,

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and said, I need
to go to the front.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.382 align:middle line:90%
I have to look at that house.

00:19:16.382 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, there's
a little for sale

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
by owner sign knocked
over on the ground.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Called the guy up, went
in the house, was stunned.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:84%
It was exactly the
house that I wanted.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's a strange house.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not your normal house.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Walked in the front
door, I was paralyzed.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.268 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I'd be
buying the house.

00:19:32.268 --> 00:19:33.965 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even gotten
past the foyer.

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I did buy the house,
and many miracles

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
happened around
allowing that to happen.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I felt intuitively guided to put
a mural in one of the archways.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And my guides told
me at the time

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.949 align:middle line:84%
make sure you put it on
something that can be removed,

00:19:53.949 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:90%
and I was startled.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
don't want to do that.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.085 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
leave this house.

00:19:58.085 --> 00:19:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Why would I want that?

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:90%
But I listened, and I did it.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So we had a business,
Conscious Media Network.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
As time went on, we
needed to sell the house.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
It was a struggling
business financially,

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:90%
beautiful otherwise.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Sold the house at
the top of the market

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:84%
because my guides told me one
day put a sign in the ground.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Start fixing that
house up right now.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:90%
You have to sell it immediately.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And I hit it right at
the top of the market

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:90%
by the time it finally sold.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
First thing that went
out was that mural.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was so sad.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I can't even tell you.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:90%
I thought, why did this happen?

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Where am I ever going
to put that thing?

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle line:90%
It only fits in one spot.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:90%
So a few years go on.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:90%
CMN's doing well.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:90%
We merge with Gaiam.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Now I can buy the house back.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.085 align:middle line:84%
And someone calls me and
says, Regina, your old house

00:20:47.085 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:90%
is for sale.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Now the bottom of
the market has hit,

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:84%
so now it's worth half of what
it was that I sold it for.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Sure enough, got in line.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
wanted the house.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And I knew from the first
day that house is my house.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:90%
It's coming to me.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:84%
All the escrows ahead
of us will fall through,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.950 align:middle line:90%
which is exactly what happened.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.335 align:middle line:90%
Bought it for half that amount.

00:21:07.335 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
that went back in

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
was that mural, back in
the exact same place.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
those things that

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
how did they know in 2000 that
in 2013 I'd be moving back

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:84%
into that place, enough to
warn me to put this mural?

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It would've been painted over.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Because they can
see further down the road.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.311 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:26.311 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And speaking
of another house story,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
my wife and I
decided to downsize.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:84%
We had a very large house in
an expensive section of Dallas.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Our kids were grown.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
We didn't need to be in that
school district anymore.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So she started
looking for a house.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And she would drag me out the
office to go look at houses.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I started requesting
a benevolent outcome

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:84%
to buy every single
house that we saw.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And we even put
an offer on one--

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and this was six years ago
when the market was not

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:84%
starting to do very well--
and the offer that we made

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.750 align:middle line:84%
was turned down because someone
payed full price for it.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And so finally I said, OK, I
request the most benevolent

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.680 align:middle line:84%
outcome for the
perfect house for us.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.381 align:middle line:90%
My wife found it the next day.

00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:90%
And it does work.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not really amazing.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.365 align:middle line:90%
That's how life works.

00:22:23.365 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If we choose to
engage with the unseen realms,

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.155 align:middle line:90%
that is how life works.

00:22:28.155 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.904 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that thing
is, like you said before,

00:22:30.904 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:84%
you have to build
your confidence.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And another aspect of
it is you say you really

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:90%
need to be habitual about this.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.764 align:middle line:84%
If you're not habitual,
you won't think to ask.

00:22:42.764 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets
really important

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:84%
or when your life is in
danger, as an example.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you're requesting these
mundane benevolent outcomes,

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
going along, and then even
requesting things like a MBO

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
for a meeting at work or
for a date that you're on

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it
happens to be, then

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.605 align:middle line:90%
suddenly something happens.

00:23:09.605 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I'll add, as an
example, I had a lady

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:84%
that told me her daughter was
in Union City, California,

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and she was walking
downtown at night.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And this van full of men
started following her.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.540 align:middle line:84%
She got very concerned,
and she was into MBOs.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
She requested a
benevolent outcome,

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and about that time
a group of people

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:84%
came out outside of the
door, and the van drove away.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said she knew
that her daughter--

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She was in danger.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: --had been in
danger, and that saved her.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
have the awareness

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.505 align:middle line:90%
to be able to ask for it.

00:23:54.505 --> 00:23:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You just
brought up a point.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.345 align:middle line:84%
Because the woman who was
thinking about her daughter,

00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and the daughter
knew to do this.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes we're associated
with people that aren't aware

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:84%
that they have all of this
talent at their disposal, all

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:90%
this help.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Or they
don't believe it.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
don't believe it.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:09.995 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:24:09.995 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you say that
the process of requesting help

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
for yourself from your own
guides and angels is different

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.370 align:middle line:84%
than that of requesting
help for another.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Theo, my guardian angel--
or my GA, I call him.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.572 align:middle line:84%
And he likes the term
servants of the creator,

00:24:31.572 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:84%
but nobody would know
what I was talking about.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:34.238 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:34.238 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: OK.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:84%
He tells me that
there are a little

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
over one million golden
light beings that

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:84%
handle all of these
specific requests

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and handle you on a
minute-by-minute basis.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:46.900 align:middle line:90%
They're monitoring you.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:84%
There's another set
of souls that we

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:84%
call angels that are
about over a million, too,

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and they handle all
the prayers on Earth.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.890 align:middle line:84%
When you're asking for
something for someone else,

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:84%
instead of saying, I request
a most benevolent outcome,

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:90%
you say I ask.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked
Theo, I said, that

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:90%
sounds about the same thing.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:90%
He said, read the dictionary.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:27.076 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.076 --> 00:25:29.739 align:middle line:84%
In my first book,
"Living Prayer"--

00:25:29.739 --> 00:25:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: "Living Prayer, yes.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And by
the second book,

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I decided I had all these
different ways of saying

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:90%
a living prayer.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:90%
There were just a ton of them.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, gosh, this is
going to be too hard for people

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:90%
to remember.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I was inspired, if you
will, to come up with a phrase

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that everyone could
remember, just

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:84%
like saying I request a most
benevolent outcome for dot,

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:90%
dot, dot.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:26:00.400 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I ask any and all
beings to blank, blank, blank.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And so that's called
a benevolent prayer.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I call those my BPs or
benevolent prayers now.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:84%
There was a time
a number of years

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.121 align:middle line:84%
ago where a meditation partner
and I used to do a lot of work

00:26:17.121 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:90%
We'd do these meditations.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And if someone
needed help, we would

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.816 align:middle line:84%
work with a remote
healing with them.

00:26:22.816 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And we had pretty good
luck with all of that.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But one day we were
told by the guides

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:84%
not to send our own
energy any longer and not

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:90%
to engage on that level.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:90%
And I asked, why?

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And they said, because the
guides on the other side

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%
are much more familiar with
the needs of the individual

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:90%
that you're trying to assist.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And you may think that the way
you're asking for this help

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:84%
or what you're asking for
is the right thing for them,

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.080 align:middle line:84%
when, in fact, it needs to be
maybe modulated for that person

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
so they can receive that
intention and that energy

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:84%
perfectly for the
event of healing

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and that these guides are
uniquely skilled to be

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
able to see into,
look into the aura,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
into the matrix of the person
and work at that level.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: But when you're
requesting a benevolent prayer,

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:84%
you're basically, again, turning
it over to these angels who

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:84%
actually work with
the people's guides.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So as an example,
let's just say there's

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:90%
a giant earthquake in Japan.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are people buried
underneath the rubble.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:84%
You can say, I ask
any and all beings

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:84%
to assist and comfort the people
that are buried in this rubble

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:90%
until they are rescued.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
any and all beings,

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.614 align:middle line:84%
it could be a dog
that finds them.

00:27:45.614 --> 00:27:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: It could be a child.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.149 align:middle line:84%
It could be anyone that
finds them in that rubble.

00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And those people will
be inspired or those animals

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.320 align:middle line:84%
will be inspired appropriately
in that moment by the other

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And so when you say
these benevolent prayers,

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:84%
it really gives
you a warm feeling

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.936 align:middle line:84%
that you feel like at least
you're doing something.

00:28:06.936 --> 00:28:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Because a lot of times
we feel so cut off and we see,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
oh, gosh, that's terrible
that that's happening to those

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:84%
people, where, in actuality,
you can do something.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:84%
You could say this
benevolent prayer.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's been described
to me as if it

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.430 align:middle line:84%
was a rainbow of
multi colors that

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:90%
goes out and over to that place.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are rainbows
coming from all

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.145 align:middle line:84%
over the world from other
people saying prayers,

00:28:36.145 --> 00:28:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and they all come
into that same place.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:38.853 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It does matter.

00:28:38.853 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:84%
When we see some
disaster on the news,

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:43.820 align:middle line:84%
it does matter if we
send that request out.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, if you have

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:84%
everyone in a group say
the same benevolent prayer,

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
then you're creating
this greater energy--

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.116 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:55.116 --> 00:28:57.283 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: --I've been told
that's greater than the--

00:28:57.283 --> 00:28:58.741 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've
been told the same.

00:28:58.741 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: --individual
people that say it.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: So I tell people if
you happen to go to a church,

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
one of the problems that I see
in churches is that there'll be

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:84%
one person up at the
front saying a prayer,

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and everyone bows their
head, and they're listening.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:18.745 align:middle line:84%
But if they would be
asked to say a prayer,

00:29:18.745 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:84%
if they would say,
would everyone

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:84%
join me in this prayer
for Brother John,

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.330 align:middle line:84%
who's sick in the
hospital, as an example,

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.610 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it happens
to be, and everyone

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.890 align:middle line:84%
says that, then there's
this great energy that

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:90%
goes to Brother John.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.024 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The Unitarian
Church is famous for this.

00:29:35.024 --> 00:29:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Because people can
write in their prayers

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:84%
to the Unitarian
Church, and they

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:84%
have prayer groups all over
that accept those requests

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.752 align:middle line:84%
and put them in and focus
intently in numbers on that,

00:29:45.752 --> 00:29:46.960 align:middle line:90%
which is a wonderful service.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: But they need to
be saying this out loud--

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: --together
to sort of make--

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.265 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that's a point.

00:29:50.265 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: OK.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.725 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It has
to be physical.

00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: It has to be physical.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You
can't just think it.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.081 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:29:55.081 --> 00:29:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Or in writing, if
someone is not able to speak.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I've had
people that have

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:84%
said that they thought a
benevolent outcome, an MBO

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and it
has worked for them.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:84%
But I've been told that
if you say it out loud

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:84%
you're creating
this greater energy.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.088 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A frequency.

00:30:15.088 --> 00:30:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And it works a lot
faster than if you're just

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.570 align:middle line:90%
thinking it.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we're in
a physical world,

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.185 align:middle line:84%
and it needs to be
something said physically.

00:30:22.185 --> 00:30:23.518 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think you're right.

00:30:23.518 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people have
experienced a situation where

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.775 align:middle line:90%
they've just had it.

00:30:26.775 --> 00:30:30.960 align:middle line:84%
They're so frustrated, and then
they just yell something out.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, things start
moving and changing out

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:84%
of the power of that frustration
and emotion of that request.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.082 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:30:40.082 --> 00:30:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I had a lady the other day
that sent in a story to me

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that she had a dream where
I think they were riding

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
three-wheelers or
something like that,

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.570 align:middle line:90%
and they were flying along.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:57.560 align:middle line:84%
It was very scary, and she
felt like she was about to die.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I request
a benevolent outcome

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.440 align:middle line:90%
and yelled it out.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly,
everything turned calm,

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and they were pulling
into the driveway.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.547 align:middle line:84%
So it was like
everything calmed down.

00:31:10.547 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
a message to her.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.838 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
hear that story a lot.

00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:15.217 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:31:15.217 --> 00:31:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A girl I know who was
in a car wreck a couple years

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.700 align:middle line:90%
ago, same thing.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is a very common one.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Everything goes
into slow motion.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly she feels
arms around her,

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and the arms were of
her deceased brother,

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.400 align:middle line:90%
who also died in a car wreck.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So here she is about to
go through the same thing,

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and it all slowed down and the
car was twisted and totalled,

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and she had nothing
but a cracked ankle.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.060 align:middle line:90%
She came out unscathed.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.249 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have
a scratch on her.

00:31:41.249 --> 00:31:41.915 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:31:41.915 --> 00:31:42.415 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:42.415 --> 00:31:47.525 align:middle line:84%
And in this book, I have
hundreds of stories.

00:31:47.525 --> 00:31:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Gentle Way
3, Master Your Life,"

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.150 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of stories
that were sent in to me.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of
stories about people

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that were miraculously
saved on icy roads

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:84%
where they were spinning
around going the wrong way

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.725 align:middle line:84%
and about to go off
cliffs and everything.

00:32:04.725 --> 00:32:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One time I was
trapped under a log underwater,

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:07.720 align:middle line:90%
and I gave up.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.053 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I can't believe
this is how I'm going to die.

00:32:10.053 --> 00:32:12.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a foot about
me, I see the sunlight,

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and I'm trapped under a log.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Everything went black,
and then sometime later I

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.100 align:middle line:84%
was downstream sputtering
and came out of the water.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what happened,
but something just loosened it.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even know
when I popped up.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Because it seemed like that was
the first breath I had taken.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.854 align:middle line:84%
And these kinds
of things, I think

00:32:32.854 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:84%
they're happening in our lives a
lot of times when we don't even

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.280 align:middle line:90%
know that's what's intervened.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.534 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:32:38.534 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
I wanted to talk about

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:45.390 align:middle line:84%
is when you use your
guides to find things.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.049 align:middle line:84%
Do you have some favorite
stories about finding things?

00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Oh.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:53.860 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.860 --> 00:33:02.290 align:middle line:84%
One time we went to the
theater, and when we got back

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:07.150 align:middle line:84%
from the movie theater I
couldn't find my wedding ring.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we're looking
all over the place.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:84%
We go back to the theater,
climbing under everything.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I requested
a benevolent outcome

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:22.470 align:middle line:90%
to find my wedding ring.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, there it
was in the sink of my wife --

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I had washed my hands just
before running out the door,

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and it had slipped
off into her sink.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:90%
So we found it.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was one of those things
that it just kind of turned up.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And I've have lots of
stories sent to me where, oh,

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Tom, let me tell you about this.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I lost this, and I requested
a benevolent outcome,

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.892 align:middle line:84%
and five minutes
later I found it.

00:33:55.892 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:90%
So it really--

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I had a weird
thing recently like that.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Here at the office, I lost
one of my gold earrings.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And I came home.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't there.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I thought it fell off
somewhere at the studios.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a month
later, mind you.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.719 align:middle line:84%
That office has
been vacuumed a lot,

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:90%
because they vacuum every night.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:16.714 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yep.

00:34:16.714 --> 00:34:19.213 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A month later, I
walk in, and right in the middle

00:34:19.213 --> 00:34:21.330 align:middle line:84%
of the floor there it
was, sitting in the middle

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:21.980 align:middle line:90%
of the floor.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: In the
middle of the floor.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It wasn't
like it was tucked away.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.061 align:middle line:90%
It was the middle of the floor.

00:34:25.061 --> 00:34:28.795 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like,
how is that possible?

00:34:28.795 --> 00:34:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It would have been sucked
up or any number of things.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.529 align:middle line:90%
But there it was.

00:34:34.529 --> 00:34:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: You've got
a good guardian angel.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I do.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, that stuff's happened--
I got a lot of good ones.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:40.469 align:middle line:84%
But that's because
I've been calling

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:41.476 align:middle line:90%
on them for a long time.

00:34:41.476 --> 00:34:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
talk about time.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times we
say, oh, please just

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:90%
get me there on time.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Someone's late for a meeting.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:84%
Some strange things happen
around the subject of time,

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:52.110 align:middle line:84%
because they know
how to bend it.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: They do.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.318 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you
talk about that?

00:34:54.318 --> 00:34:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And you can
ask for them to bend it.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:84%
As an example, let's
just say it's 1:40,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and you need to be in an
appointment at 2 o'clock,

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and it typically takes 30
or 40 minutes to get there.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.080 align:middle line:84%
You say, OK, I request
a compression of time

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and request a most
benevolent outcome

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.930 align:middle line:90%
for getting there on time.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:90%
You can't look at your watch.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.470 align:middle line:84%
You can't look at
the clock in the car.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:23.392 align:middle line:90%
You just drive.

00:35:23.392 --> 00:35:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
you'll get there

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.200 align:middle line:84%
about one or two minutes
before you're supposed to.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.770 align:middle line:90%
It's, like, impossible.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Impossible,
but you do it.

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.476 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now this is
another thing you write about

00:35:33.476 --> 00:35:35.170 align:middle line:84%
in the book, which
they told you,

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that we should be asking
for the impossible.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Now why did they tell you that?

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Well, because
there are people in such bad

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:51.180 align:middle line:84%
conditions that they don't feel
like they could ever get out

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:51.870 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take, as
an example, a woman

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:90%
in an abusive relationship.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.189 align:middle line:84%
And she just feels
like it's just--

00:36:03.189 --> 00:36:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She's trapped.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Trapped
in utter despair.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But she could say, I request
the most benevolent outcome

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:84%
for not only my safety but
the safety of my children

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and to be led to a better
life, anything like that.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:84%
She can word it
in her own words.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And those things
seem impossible,

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:31.760 align:middle line:90%
but suddenly things change.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because she can't
see logically a way out of it.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: But things happen.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.366 align:middle line:90%
Or even take a prostitute.

00:36:39.366 --> 00:36:42.360 align:middle line:84%
There are people that are
prostituting themselves,

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and they don't see any way out.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And for one thing,
every day they can say,

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I request a most benevolent
outcome to be disease-free

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.250 align:middle line:90%
today for that.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, they could say,

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I request a most
benevolent outcome

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.710 align:middle line:84%
to be able to find a
better life than mine now.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So there are things that
seem impossible to ask

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.097 align:middle line:90%
for that they can ask.

00:37:06.097 --> 00:37:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about
business a little bit.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I like the story you wrote about
about a friend of yours who

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.710 align:middle line:84%
was a film distributor and
something that took place

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:84%
in Budapest, as I recall,
at a convention there.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember that
story about that guy?

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:27.270 align:middle line:84%
He came in to a meeting, and he
wanted something very specific.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:84%
This man needed something
like I need $2 million.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Oh.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's story.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.166 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: I remember
a little bit.

00:37:35.166 --> 00:37:37.677 align:middle line:90%


00:37:37.677 --> 00:37:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a big request.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:39.968 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Well, I know.

00:37:39.968 --> 00:37:43.460 align:middle line:90%
And gosh, it's been a while.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:47.502 align:middle line:84%
I may not be able to relate
that story correctly.

00:37:47.502 --> 00:37:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I remember it
maybe better than you.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.189 align:middle line:84%
A guy with money came along
to this particular booth

00:37:52.189 --> 00:37:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and asked a go-between,
someone that knew both of them.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, I'm looking
for a film distributor and--

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.191 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Oh, and he said, yeah.

00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:00.190 align:middle line:90%
And he brought him over.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.464 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:01.464 --> 00:38:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think it was by
the end of the day he had his

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.460 align:middle line:84%
commitment for his $2 million
because this guy wandered in.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.210 align:middle line:84%
He said he looked
kind of perplexed

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.715 align:middle line:90%
as to the game and everything.

00:38:10.715 --> 00:38:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.589 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He said, I need
to invest in a certain type

00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:14.765 align:middle line:90%
of film, and there he was.

00:38:14.765 --> 00:38:17.280 align:middle line:84%
He got his distributor
within no time flat.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And speaking of things
of that part of the business,

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:84%
when things don't
appear to work,

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:34.220 align:middle line:84%
for two years I tried to raise
money for a package of movies.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was going to be based
on the novels by a writer

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.535 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Cheyney, an
English writer, that wrote them

00:38:42.535 --> 00:38:43.260 align:middle line:90%
in World War II.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.440 align:middle line:90%
These were spy novels.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.330 align:middle line:84%
For two years, I went to
Prague and St. Petersburg,

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Russia and Budapest and
Cannes and Paris and all,

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and each time that
I would get close

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.070 align:middle line:84%
to putting the money together
for this package of films,

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:84%
it would fall apart for
the weirdest reasons.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And so finally one day
in meditation I'm saying,

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, Theo, I've been requesting
benevolent outcomes all along,

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.270 align:middle line:84%
because I trust perfectly
in this process.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Yet each time it's
been falling apart.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't been able
to raise the money?

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Tom, that's
not on your soul contract.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, had you
gone down that path,

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.440 align:middle line:84%
you would never reach
the number of people

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:40.220 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
reach in your books

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and writing and
speaking that you're

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:90%
going to reach in your life.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that's just not
on your soul contract.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that requesting

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.670 align:middle line:84%
benevolent outcomes
does is it keeps you

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:55.300 align:middle line:90%
on your soul contract.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And when people say,
oh, I want freedom,

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
they act like that
soul contract is

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.760 align:middle line:84%
something that was
forced on them.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.220 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:13.335 align:middle line:84%
This was the soul path that you
chose with your own guardian

00:40:13.335 --> 00:40:15.750 align:middle line:84%
angel and your higher
self and everybody

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.640 align:middle line:84%
involved that would be
the perfect life for you

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:84%
with the perfect
number of challenges,

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:26.850 align:middle line:84%
the perfect number of successes,
the perfect life for that life.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But, as Theo says, if you're not
requesting benevolent outcomes,

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.300 align:middle line:84%
suddenly you go off
the reservation.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.081 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:35.580 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
answer the question

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.420 align:middle line:84%
why is it that sometimes your
requests are not answered.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's because it's
not in your short-term

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:47.490 align:middle line:90%
or long-term best interest.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
keep that in mind.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Because I've
had people say, oh,

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I request a benevolent
outcome to marry this guy,

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.160 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't happen.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't supposed to.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.414 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: She was requesting
a benevolent outcome--

00:41:03.414 --> 00:41:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: For something that
wasn't in her best interest,

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.205 align:middle line:90%
ultimately, on a soul level.

00:41:07.205 --> 00:41:09.285 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And there was going
to be somebody coming along that

00:41:09.285 --> 00:41:10.660 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a
lot better for her.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm having so much
fun chatting with you

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.590 align:middle line:84%
because this is one of
my favorite subjects,

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:90%
and I use it all the time.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And another little story about
something that didn't work out.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.250 align:middle line:90%
I wanted it to work out.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I kept going back to
France all the time.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.670 align:middle line:90%
I love France.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:27.220 align:middle line:90%
Spring time came--

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Me too.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and it was like
I was itching to go back

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:29.310 align:middle line:90%
to France.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.399 align:middle line:84%
And this particular year, I
was meditating one morning,

00:41:32.399 --> 00:41:33.690 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, well, let's see.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm booking my ticket.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:35.560 align:middle line:90%
It's May.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.602 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to France.

00:41:36.602 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And my guides said,
no, you're not going.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, yes, I am.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And we got in this
back and forth.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't normally do that, but
I thought, well, that's weird.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:44.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm going.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.630 align:middle line:90%
So bought my ticket, day came.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.172 align:middle line:84%
I thought everything
worked out fine.

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.421 align:middle line:90%
It's the morning of departure.

00:41:49.421 --> 00:41:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I have to drive to the airport.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:55.526 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up with the most
raging bladder infection, which

00:41:55.526 --> 00:41:56.900 align:middle line:84%
any woman's who's
had one-- and I

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.640 align:middle line:90%
don't get them-- can understand.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.020 align:middle line:90%
There was no reason for it.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I was fine when I went to bed.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And it literally was so bad I
couldn't make it to the airport

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.640 align:middle line:84%
under any circumstances
had I tried.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.794 align:middle line:84%
And so once the fight
was about to leave

00:42:12.794 --> 00:42:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and there was no way I
was going to get there,

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:17.902 align:middle line:84%
it was clearly missed, I
had a little glass of water

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:20.110 align:middle line:84%
with some vitamin C. Everything
cleared up instantly.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally within
an hour it was gone,

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and it just doesn't work
like that in real life.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
a creative way.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And many times when
I've tried to do things

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.700 align:middle line:84%
in some bizarre way something
happens to stop me from it.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.400 align:middle line:84%
But that one was so literal
I said, OK, you're right.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.077 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going.

00:42:38.077 --> 00:42:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't sell
the ticket either.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.430 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sell it back.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:42.590 align:middle line:90%
So I lost my money.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And so now I've learned if my
beings say, you're not going,

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Another thing from
business that I

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.950 align:middle line:84%
can relate for people
that are in business

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and understand this, there
was a time a few years ago

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:03.390 align:middle line:84%
when I personally and my
company was sued for $1 million.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.230 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And a Spanish TV network that
I was doing business with,

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.590 align:middle line:90%
they were sued for $5 million.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And another film
distributor in Houston

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.470 align:middle line:90%
was sued for $1 million.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:18.262 align:middle line:90%


00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, I was
requesting benevolent outcomes

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:21.997 align:middle line:90%
for this all along the way.

00:43:21.997 --> 00:43:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Goodness.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: I wound up having
a friend of mine that was

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:30.120 align:middle line:84%
an attorney in Arkansas answer
all my stuff for me free.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But finally, I was forced
to hire an attorney down

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.960 align:middle line:90%
in Houston to represent me.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And I walk out my gate to
put the garbage in the can,

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and the guy from across the
alley, it was an attorney.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you know an
attorney down in Houston?

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.390 align:middle line:84%
My nephew is an
attorney down there.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Woah.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And so he wound
up handling the case for me.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we went to a
mediation a few months later,

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and in the mediation
he was saying,

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.950 align:middle line:84%
now, Tom, you've got to
expect that you're probably

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.340 align:middle line:90%
going to have to pay something.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.705 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm requesting
benevolent outcomes.

00:44:07.705 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.650 align:middle line:90%
What's this guy talking about?

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
mediation it wound up

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that the TV network, which is no
longer in business, by the way,

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.520 align:middle line:84%
settled for $400,000
or $500,000,

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.460 align:middle line:84%
the other distributor in
Houston settled for $100,00,

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.024 align:middle line:90%
and we paid 0.

00:44:28.024 --> 00:44:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You paid 0.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yep.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There you go.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.470 align:middle line:84%
By talking to a neighbor
over a garbage can.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now you talk about
something called the Radiant

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Effect.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.170 align:middle line:90%
What is the Radiant Effect?

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: The Radiant
Effect is, as an example,

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:84%
let's say you're
driving down the road,

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and there's people
in your car with you.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And you request a benevolent
outcome for the drive.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The Radiant Effect seems to
take care of those people that

00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.487 align:middle line:84%
are riding with you and-- let's
just say you're on a freeway--

00:45:00.487 --> 00:45:03.070 align:middle line:84%
even the people on either side
of you or right in front of you

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.840 align:middle line:90%
or behind you.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.590 align:middle line:90%
It all seems to work.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:07.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:14.770 align:middle line:84%
As an example, a lady
wrote to me from Canada.

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:20.274 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I took
my vacation in Seattle.

00:45:20.274 --> 00:45:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I requested a
benevolent outcome.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.165 align:middle line:84%
And I was taking
public transportation.

00:45:24.165 --> 00:45:25.570 align:middle line:90%
I was on a bus.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And as the bus
started to pull up

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.992 align:middle line:84%
in front of the Space
Needle, suddenly a van

00:45:32.992 --> 00:45:34.700 align:middle line:84%
stopped right in front
of it, and the guy

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.866 align:middle line:90%
was looking at the bus stop.

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.990 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't looking
in front of him.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And they almost
ran into the van.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They missed it like
six inches or so.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.630 align:middle line:84%
He slammed on the brake,
and everybody went forward.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:50.320 align:middle line:84%
But she had the presence of
mind to just joke with him,

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:55.840 align:middle line:84%
because she had felt
completely safe.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.782 align:middle line:84%
But all the other people
in that bus were safe, too.

00:45:59.782 --> 00:46:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: OK.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.688 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There has to be
a resonance that's created

00:46:03.688 --> 00:46:04.260 align:middle line:90%
of some kind.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you're
consciously bringing this

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.850 align:middle line:84%
in, first of all you're coming
from a higher frequency range

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to, A, trust in it, know that
it will be there to help you.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:17.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of relaxation
and grace in that situation.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And so there has to be a
kind of resonance that's

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.637 align:middle line:84%
happening that would spread
out to the other people.

00:46:22.637 --> 00:46:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yes.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We know everything
is nothing but energy

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:25.424 align:middle line:90%
and resonance.

00:46:25.424 --> 00:46:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Right.

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:26.798 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:46:26.798 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:30.467 align:middle line:84%
When you're shining your
light, let's face it,

00:46:30.467 --> 00:46:32.800 align:middle line:84%
if you're shining your light,
you're lighting up a room.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Before we go,
tell me maybe one or two

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:40.420 align:middle line:84%
of your absolutely most favorite
stories about intervention

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.707 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of guides ever.

00:46:41.707 --> 00:46:42.915 align:middle line:90%
We talk about the impossible.

00:46:42.915 --> 00:46:44.952 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Yeah.

00:46:44.952 --> 00:46:51.710 align:middle line:84%
One lady wrote to me and
said that they had just

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:55.220 align:middle line:84%
moved to a farm in
Kansas, and one day there

00:46:55.220 --> 00:47:01.215 align:middle line:84%
was a tornado literally
bearing down on them.

00:47:01.215 --> 00:47:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And so she grabbed
her kids and start

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.690 align:middle line:84%
running for the storm
shelter, and she

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:07.260 align:middle line:90%
requested a benevolent outcome.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The tornado literally lifted
up and went over her house.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And that's something
we haven't gotten into, but I

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.390 align:middle line:90%
will mention.

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: You can
change weather.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:19.210 align:middle line:90%
You can request--

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Even for my trip here
I requested a clear day going

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:24.240 align:middle line:90%
and coming.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.234 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
was weather today,

00:47:28.234 --> 00:47:29.400 align:middle line:90%
but there won't be tomorrow.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When
you leave, exactly.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:34.195 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: So you can request--

00:47:34.195 --> 00:47:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what most
people would feel falls

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.600 align:middle line:90%
in the range of the impossible.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Exactly.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.485 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But it's not.

00:47:38.485 --> 00:47:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: Sure.

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:42.340 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.020 align:middle line:90%
And I've tested this.

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I've had people in northern
climes, like the UK.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I was told by Gaia that you can
request one sunny day a week,

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.390 align:middle line:84%
if you're going through
weeks with no sun.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I told everybody to start
requesting a sunny Saturday,

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:03.070 align:middle line:84%
because that's when most people
are out about and everything.

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And so this group
of people in the UK

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.220 align:middle line:84%
started requesting
sunny Saturdays,

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.527 align:middle line:84%
and every Saturday
it would be sunny.

00:48:10.527 --> 00:48:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There you go.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: You can do it.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I absolutely love it.

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:18.530 align:middle line:84%
The book, "The Gentle Way," and
the other one's "Gently Way 3"?

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: Well, "The Gentle
Way 2," the story continues.

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:25.285 align:middle line:84%
And "The Gentle Way 3"
is "Master Your Life."

00:48:25.285 --> 00:48:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
the newest one.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORE: And that's the one
that has hundreds of stories.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:29.765 align:middle line:90%
You'll love it.

00:48:29.765 --> 00:48:30.431 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I do.

00:48:30.431 --> 00:48:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:32.180 align:middle line:90%
This is right up my alley.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Tom.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:33.526 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORE: OK.

00:48:33.526 --> 00:48:34.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've been working
with my guides for decades,

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and the outcomes never
cease to amaze me,

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:40.810 align:middle line:84%
as some of these stories
I've shared would show.

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot encourage you
enough to give it a serious

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:46.260 align:middle line:84%
effort for your own most
benevolent outcomes.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.620 align:middle line:84%
