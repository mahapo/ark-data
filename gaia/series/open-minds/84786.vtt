00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Dr. Joe Dispenza

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:10%
has been a favorite of Gaiam
viewers around the world

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:10%
for years because he brings a
clarity to the subject of how

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:10%
we create our physical reality.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:10%
Some people don't like to
think that their condition is

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:10%
a product of their own
beliefs and expectations,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:10%
but Dr. Joe has spent
years detailing the how for

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:10%
and the why.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:10%
In his newest book,
You Are The Placebo,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:10%
he's outdone himself in taking
this science mainstream.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Yet there's nothing mainstream
about it yet, in terms

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
of the fact that--
I mean, some people

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:90%
even call it "faith healing."

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But you're bringing
"faith healing,"

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
if that's what they
want to call it,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.665 align:middle line:84%
to the highest possible
scientific viewpoint.

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:05.081 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE DISPENZA:
Well, if you think

00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:84%
about the definition
of faith, faith

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
is believing in thought
more than anything else.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.213 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So in a
sense, if we demystify it,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:90%
I think we're in alignment.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.545 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you who aren't
already familiar with you--

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:84%
we have new subscribers
all the time--

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
you had a little bit
of-- not a little.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.070 align:middle line:84%
You had a huge
personal experience

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.486 align:middle line:84%
that kind of set
you on this path.

00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
We'll just take a
minute for that,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.627 align:middle line:84%
because I really would
like to suggest that people

00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:28.960 align:middle line:84%
go to the archives if they
want to hear the whole story,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
because I've interviewed
you a few times before.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:10%
I think in order for us to wake
up, we need a wake up call.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:10%
And I got the call in 1986.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.240 align:middle line:10%
I was run over by a truck in
a triathlon in Palm Springs

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:10%
and broke six
vertebrae in my spine.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:10%
And the prognosis
was pretty poor.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:10%
And I had to make
a decision if I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:10%
was going to take the
conventional approach

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:10%
and go with a surgery or see if
I could make the change myself.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And I chose the latter,
and it started me

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
on this whole journey of
making internal changes

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and measuring the
effects in our bodies.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
had to really put

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.157 align:middle line:84%
your body where your beliefs
were, because they informed you

00:02:06.157 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
that if you didn't
have the operation,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.850 align:middle line:84%
you were likely going to be,
essentially, unable to walk,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.802 align:middle line:90%
and many other things.

00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I was facing some pretty
difficult moments there.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
cord impingement.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I had bone fragments
on my spinal cord.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And the arch that the
spinal cord passed through

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:90%
broke like a pretzel.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So I was facing paralysis-- a
lot of neurological deficits.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And if I was going
to stand up, they

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.650 align:middle line:84%
were concerned that it was
going to make it worse.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So I chose to not
have the surgery

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that there's
a power within us that gives us

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:84%
life that we could
basically connect with.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's bold.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.525 align:middle line:84%
Most people would
not have the courage.

00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But you were young man, and you
probably-- like all young men,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:90%
you're immortal.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Of course you can kick
it, whatever it is.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: [LAUGHS]

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's
the wonderful thing

00:02:51.443 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
about, you know,
the spirit of youth.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But that had to have
been a scary decision.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I think
when you're facing a crisis

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:84%
or trauma, it's
so amazing how we

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:84%
focus on what we don't
want to have happen

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
instead of what we do
want to have happen.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:90%
And so I wasn't going anywhere.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't doing anything.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
I was laying face down.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, well--

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, for months.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.964 align:middle line:84%
If this intelligence is real
and it's giving me life,

00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
contact with it.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to give it a plan.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had
time to practice.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't doing anything.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.396 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
I'm not going

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:84%
to let any thought
slip by my awareness

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.614 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't want
to experience.

00:03:22.614 --> 00:03:24.997 align:middle line:84%
So sounds easy,
but those six weeks

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
were really my dark
night of the soul,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't get my mind
to do what I wanted it to do.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And if I got frustrated
or angry, it got worse.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So I started to figured it
out after a couple weeks,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and then things started
to change for me.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And soon as I started seeing
physical changes in my body,

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.454 align:middle line:84%
I started correlating what
I was doing with my mind,

00:03:43.454 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and I paid attention
to what I did

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and I did it with
more enthusiasm.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
healing pretty quickly.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.095 align:middle line:84%
And I just made a
deal with myself

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that if I was ever
able to walk again,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd spend the rest
of my life studying

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.532 align:middle line:84%
the mind-body connection
and mind over matter.

00:03:55.532 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, that's
what I've been doing.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you blew the
minds of all the people

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.742 align:middle line:84%
that were involved
in the medical staff.

00:04:00.742 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a
defining moment.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And they were open
to the concept.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I mean,
it's not for everybody.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.689 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just not-- that
choice is not for everybody.

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to get into that and more,

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to have two
separate conversations on how

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
we are subject to our own
preconditioned programs

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that happen, I
would say, probably

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
even before this lifetime, and
certainly into this lifetime

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.839 align:middle line:84%
and then beyond, and also what
happens to us collectively.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
In a second show, we're going
to talk about that, but--

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --there's
a quote in the book

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.671 align:middle line:90%
I want to start out with.

00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: OK.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I really liked it.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Our
bodies and emotions

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:84%
are one, aligned to a
destiny predetermined

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:90%
by our unconscious programs."

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that, you're talking
about the fact everything

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:84%
we're expressing in
life is essentially

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.201 align:middle line:84%
out of an unconscious program--
95% percent of the greater

00:04:59.201 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.408 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:05:00.408 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're trying to
use 5% of the conscious mind

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:84%
to reprogram that part by
doing our little affirmations

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.902 align:middle line:84%
and such, which you're
known for on What The Bleep.

00:05:09.902 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there's
a lot to that.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.758 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:05:12.758 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, thoughts are the
language of the brain,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and feelings are the
language of the body.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And how you think and how you
feel creates a state of being.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking certain
thoughts that make you happy,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:84%
those thoughts will produce
certain chemicals in your body

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
for you to begin to feel exactly
the way you were just thinking.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The moment you feel
the way you think,

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.230 align:middle line:84%
you begin to think
the way you feel.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:84%
The redundancy of that cycle,
Regina, over time, conditions

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:90%
the body to become the mind.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And once the body becomes the
mind, that's called a habit.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is science.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.470 align:middle line:84%
95% of who we are by the
time we're 35 years old

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.460 align:middle line:84%
is a set of memorized behaviors,
emotional reactions, beliefs,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
perceptions, and
attitudes that--

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 95% and we
think we have free will.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.176 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Functionally, yeah.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.789 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So they function like a
subconscious computer program.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.554 align:middle line:84%
So the great example
you can use is you--

00:06:02.554 --> 00:06:03.970 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to be
over 35 for this,

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.261 align:middle line:84%
but you may not be able to
consciously remember a phone

00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:84%
number, but you can pick up
the phone, look at the numbers,

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.345 align:middle line:84%
and your fingers
dial the number.

00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:10.928 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:10.928 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You've
practiced it so many times

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that your body knows
better than your brain.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes time
to change and people

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:84%
are using 5% of
their conscious mind

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:84%
to go against 95% of what they
programed subconsciously--

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:84%
you can think
positively all you want,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:84%
but if you've been feeling
negatively for the last 35

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
years, that's mind and
body in opposition.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
You could create
your dream board

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and have all your beautiful
pictures of your future,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
but if you feel unworthy, that's
mind and body in opposition.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to recondition
the body to a new mind.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the process that

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.880 align:middle line:84%
makes this so unique
as human beings

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that we
can think about what

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:90%
we're thinking about.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We can
notice how we're acting.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can pay
attention to how we're

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:84%
feeling, which means we could
modify our states of being

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:90%
to do a better job in life.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And that level of
meta-cognition or mindfulness,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:84%
because of the size
of the frontal lobe,

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:84%
allows us to begin to
observe who we're being

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.302 align:middle line:84%
so we can do a
better job in life.

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were just talking

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
about the feelings
of unworthiness,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.094 align:middle line:90%
which people relate to.

00:07:13.094 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone relates to,
in some aspect of their life,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:90%
feeling unworthy.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
human condition.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But when you stop
and think about it

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and then remember what it
feels like-- because I want

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:84%
to get into this
emotion feeling part--

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
there's a cascade
of chemicals that

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.720 align:middle line:84%
starts rolling through
not just the mind,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.780 align:middle line:84%
but through the entire body
with feelings of unworthiness.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the program,
the chemical cascade,

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.625 align:middle line:84%
the effect of the emotions into
even the quantum field, then.

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: OK.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.144 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a big, juicy question.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.954 align:middle line:90%
It gives you time to chat.

00:07:48.954 --> 00:07:50.411 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
think about this.

00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Feelings and emotions
are the end product

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:90%
of past experiences.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can remember
experiences better

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:84%
because you can
remember how you feel.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Most people can tell you
exactly where they were on 9/11.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.300 align:middle line:84%
They can tell you who they were
with, the time of day it was.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And we could say everything that
they were seeing and hearing

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
changed their internal
chemical state.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The moment they felt
differently inside of them,

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:84%
they paid attention to what
caused it outside of them.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.086 align:middle line:84%
And that event, in and of
itself, is called a memory.

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So if feelings and
emotions are the end

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
product of past
experiences, and you've

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
had some experience
in your past that

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
created the emotions
of unworthiness,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and those emotions then have
become part of your identity

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can't think greater than
how you feel, then for the most

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:84%
part, you're
thinking in the past

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
because emotions are
a record of the past.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So then what happens is we
pre-determine the destiny

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:84%
because our thoughts and our
behaviors and our emotions

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:90%
are connected to the past.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, neurotransmitters
are what

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.310 align:middle line:84%
allow us to produce
different levels of mind.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.375 align:middle line:10%
So if you're thinking
an unworthy thought,

00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:53.500 align:middle line:10%
you'll turn a set of circuits
on in your brain that

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.375 align:middle line:10%
fire in a very specific
sequence, pattern,

00:08:55.375 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:10%
and combination that
produces a level of mind.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:10%
Mind is the brain in action.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Once you get the brain
firing in tandem,

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
you get an internal
representation.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
We can call that an intention
or a hologram or whatever.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
The moment you put your
attention behind that picture

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, the
brain begins to make

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.609 align:middle line:84%
a second set of chemicals
called neuropeptides.

00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, neuropeptides are
made in the chemical brain

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:90%
or the limbic brain.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And those chemical
neuropeptides then

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:84%
begin to signal different
hormonal centers

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and begin to signal
different genes.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, genes are responsible
for making both the structure

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:90%
and function of your body.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Muscle cells make
muscle proteins

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:90%
called actin and myosin, right.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Stomach cells make stomach
proteins called enzymes.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So the body's a protein
producing machine.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you're experiencing
the same events

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:84%
or you're recreating
the same emotions,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:84%
you're signaling the exact same
genes in the exact same way.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.214 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to begin
to wear that gene out.

00:09:53.214 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
So what happens when we age?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our skin?

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.450 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our hair?

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our bones?

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.676 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our enzymes?

00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
our immune system?

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.270 align:middle line:90%
Those are all proteins.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
We start making
cheaper proteins.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So the idea then, that
when you change the way

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.270 align:middle line:84%
you think-- the idea when you
demonstrate a new behavior,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
the idea that you begin
to experience new events

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
in your life-- begins to
signal new genes in new ways.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:90%
And this is science, now.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
These epigenetic
changes begin to occur,

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
creating behavior dependant
genes-- creating experience

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:84%
dependent genes that are passed
on to the next generation.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So we are not defined by
our genes, by any means.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Genes are a parts
list of potentials.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.464 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us
to begin to instruct

00:10:36.464 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
the right genes
in the right ways.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And we become our own
biochemical engineers

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:90%
by how we think and how we feel.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know what?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.452 align:middle line:84%
There's a page that
expresses that in that book

00:10:45.452 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:90%
we'll get to in a little bit.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it wrote down here--
page 86-- that it's so

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:84%
elegantly stated, but
you just said it again--

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
you just said it yourself,
so maybe we don't need to.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about, then,
the field of potential.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about that--
that hard-wired programming

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and all of these neurochemical
responses, and the fact

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
that these are playing out
on a moment by moment basis

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:84%
within the body and affecting
our genetic structure.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Inner penetrating all of that
is simply a field of potential,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.015 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Mm-hmm.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.835 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's now start
doing the crossover between--

00:11:20.835 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: OK.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it appropriate
to talk about that yet?

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, we can work
our way there, but let's--

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
work our way there.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.586 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: OK.

00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
We'll, let's talk
about the placebo,

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll work
our way to that.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.616 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:28.616 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I mean,
think about this.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:36.210 align:middle line:84%
How can you give someone a
sugar pill, a saline injection,

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:84%
or perform some false
surgery or fake procedure

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and a certain percentage
of those people accept,

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:84%
believe, and
surrender to the idea

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that they're getting some
real treatment or real drug,

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and they begin to program
their autonomic nervous system

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
to make the exact
pharmacy of chemicals

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that they think they're
taking in the drug

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:90%
or in the treatment?

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So then the question is,
do you need the sugar pill

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:90%
or the saline injection?

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Because what those
people are doing is

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:84%
they're beginning to select a
new potential in the quantum

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.084 align:middle line:84%
And there's infinite potentials
in the quantum field.

00:12:14.084 --> 00:12:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So they're going on,
living their normal life,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.416 align:middle line:84%
thinking and feeling
the same way.

00:12:17.416 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, a doctor
comes along who's enthusiastic,

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
gives a modified
name for a new drug,

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.520 align:middle line:90%
and all it is is a sugar pill.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And they say, if you
take this pill every day,

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:84%
the research shows it does
these type of changes.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:84%
In a certain percentage
of those people,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
once they see that
pill, they'll associate

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.202 align:middle line:84%
that external substance with
the idea of getting well.

00:12:38.202 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
They're selecting the
potential in the quantum field.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Now, here's the key.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to
just have that thought.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:84%
The moment they being
to marry that thought

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.989 align:middle line:90%
with an elevated emotion like--

00:12:48.989 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like yes,
this is going to do it.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Like
inspiration, like excitement,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.446 align:middle line:90%
like gratitude--

00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's
the clear intention

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and the elevated
emotion that begins

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to program the biology of their
body into a new state of being.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:84%
In other words, their brain
and body in that moment

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
are no longer
living in the past.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain,
neurologically,

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:90%
is a record of the past.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:90%
It's an artifact.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.237 align:middle line:84%
And emotions, then, are a record
of past experiences-- feedback,

00:13:14.237 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So most people are thinking
and feeling in the past.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
In that moment,
they're no longer

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.460 align:middle line:84%
being defined by a
memory of the past.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:90%
They're being defined by--

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.841 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They've replaced
it with a new feeling.

00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: --a vision.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --a new
vision of the future.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.473 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now, the
moment they marry

00:13:29.473 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:84%
that clear intention with an
elevated emotion, the body,

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
as the unconscious mind, is
no longer living in the past.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
The body's believing it's
in that future experience

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're signaling
new genes in new ways.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about
placebo studies.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:84%
The next day, the person's going
to take the antidepressant--

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:90%
the next day.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.189 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to believe
that that antidepressant is

00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:84%
the thing that's going
to make them better.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to select that
same potential in the quantum

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
field, and they're going
to emotionally embrace it.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.854 align:middle line:84%
And all the sudden,
they're going

00:13:59.854 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
to begin to make their
own natural pharmacy

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:90%
of antidepressants.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful we
are by thought alone.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So many studies on,
just for example,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.165 align:middle line:90%
on antidepressants and placebos.

00:14:12.165 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the three
out of four people

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.994 align:middle line:84%
that take a placebo for an
antidepressant get better.

00:14:15.994 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.951 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Because they're
looking forward to a future

00:14:18.951 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and they're expecting
the outcome.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So then as people
begin to learn how

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:84%
to do that exact thing, but
instead of putting their faith

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and belief in some
external substance,

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:84%
can you eliminate that
known external substance

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and begin to select a
potential in the quantum field

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally
embrace how it would

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
feel before it occurs
so that your body,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.180 align:middle line:84%
as the unconscious mind, begins
to live in that future reality

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to program
your autonomic nervous system

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:90%
into a new state of being?

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the innate
mechanisms within us

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.557 align:middle line:84%
to do that, and we can believe
in ourselves and the potential.

00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that
question is absolutely yes.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely yes.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Except we're
in a mechanistic world

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
where we're being
bombarded with subconscious

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
programs via media, et
cetera, that we need pills.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So we have to have this
placebo or whatever

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:90%
it is-- this medium, somehow.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can't seem
to go direct just yet.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Some people can.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:90%
You can, but--

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
that's what we're

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.640 align:middle line:90%
teaching in our workshops.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, to go direct.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.196 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We're
saying, look, we

00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
know the mechanisms of
how the placebo works.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Once you
understand the science of how

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
the placebo works,
can you teach it?

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And can you eliminate
that external substance

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and have a person
believe in themselves

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and in the potential
of the quantum field?

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And once people understand
how to do it and regulate

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:84%
their internal states, their
level of suggestibility

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:90%
goes up.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.460 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the doctor
and the doctor says to you,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
you have this condition and you
react emotionally with fear,

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
do you know that you will only
accept, believe, and surrender

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to the thoughts equal
to that emotional state?

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.070 align:middle line:84%
You're only suggestible to the
thoughts equal to the fear.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So then you begin to program
your autonomic nervous system

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:90%
into a very specific destiny.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So then if you can change
a person's emotional state,

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
they will accept,
believe, and surrender

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to the thoughts equal
to that emotional state.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.717 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the change
and challenge comes.

00:16:10.717 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Because I mean,
if you think about this,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:84%
we're programed-- and one
of the things that I learned

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.917 align:middle line:84%
in writing this book is how
programed we really are--

00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And then
how we have to become

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
unprogrammed or
deprogrammed to be

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
able to see how
this process works.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you can change
your state of being

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
to a state of gratitude or
into a state of inspiration,

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.190 align:middle line:84%
you'll accept,
believe, and surrender

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:84%
to the thoughts equal
to that emotional state,

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and you'll begin to program
your autonomic nervous system

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and begin to make the new
pharmacy of chemicals that

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:84%
begins to signal the
genes in a different way.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's
interesting is

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:84%
when I alluded to--
I think it was what's

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.720 align:middle line:84%
on page 86-- is that
when you do this-- so

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:90%
say this is a condition.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:84%
You've just been given
the news that you

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
have some kind of
degenerative condition

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that both your father
and grandfather had.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:84%
And so that belief-- and we
know through epigenetics--

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton's work
Biology of Belief

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- that these
conditions aren't necessarily

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:84%
genetic, but they are
programmed in through

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
this collective belief system
that's been passed down.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
But what you're saying is
that in that moment where

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
we can elevate to that higher
state of being in our emotions,

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:84%
we can flip a switch
right then and there

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and break that
programming and actually

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
have a new programming passed
on to future generations

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.167 align:middle line:90%
from that moment.

00:17:32.167 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what's so beautiful.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
let's talk about that.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:36.195 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:36.195 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Because it's
a very important thing

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
that when we have
experiences in our life

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that change our emotional
state-- and we all have-- what

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:84%
happens is we start to
layer those emotions

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:90%
on top of each other.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And those emotions then
become our identity.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Because for the most part,
if we're feeling the same way

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:84%
every single day, it
becomes familiar to us.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And if 95% of who we are by
the time we're 35 years old

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is a set of programs,
then it's entirely

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
possible guilt is-- you look
for the guilt every morning when

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.109 align:middle line:90%
you wake up.

00:18:07.109 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:84%
You look for the
unworthiness every morning

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:84%
so you can feel the
familiar feeling called you.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you're judging
yourself and judging others

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.815 align:middle line:84%
and it's in the 95% where
your unconscious to it,

00:18:18.815 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:84%
you're doing that all
the time and you're not

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:90%
even aware of it.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.478 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:22.478 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So it's
those mechanisms, then,

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that begin to cause
people to model

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:90%
the behaviors of their parents.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
they're doing that,

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
but they're living with
the same caregivers,

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:84%
they're modeling
their behaviors.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Those particular
behaviors then begin

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
to signal the same genes
that their parent's signaled,

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and now they're headed to a
particular genetic destiny.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So the challenge
comes, then-- is

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.900 align:middle line:90%
crossing that river of change.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Here's the old self,
and here's the new self.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And the model that we
use is very simple.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Your personality creates
your personal reality.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And your personality is made up
of how you think, how you act,

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:90%
and how you feel.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So the present personality
who's listening to this show

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
has created the present personal
reality called their life.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.979 align:middle line:84%
If they want to create
a new personal reality,

00:19:12.979 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
then we have to start thinking
about what we've been thinking

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:84%
about and change it--
start paying attention

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to how we've been
acting and behaving

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and modify that-- begin to
look at the emotions that

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
keep us anchored to
the past, and decide

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
if those emotions
belong in our future.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So in our research, we found
out that most people try

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
to create a new personal
reality as the same personality,

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't work.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep thinking the
same way, acting the same way,

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
making the same choices,
creating the same experiences,

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.150 align:middle line:84%
producing the same
emotions, then your biology

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.756 align:middle line:90%
will reflect that.

00:19:44.756 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So the moment you
say, I no longer want

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:84%
to be a victim-- I'm not
going to blame, complain, make

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:90%
excuses, feel sorry for myself.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stop today-- the
moment you say that, you're

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:84%
stepping into that
river of change.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And the way you'll
know right away

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:90%
is you'll feel uncomfortable.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:90%
It will feel unfamiliar.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It'll be unpredictable,
and it will be the unknown.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Now most people, the moment they
feel that unfamiliar feeling

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and they can't
predict their guilt

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.665 align:middle line:84%
or they can't predict that
feeling that they've defined

00:20:10.665 --> 00:20:13.997 align:middle line:84%
as themselves, they go back
and make the same choices that

00:20:13.997 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:84%
lead to the same
behaviors that create

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.746 align:middle line:84%
the same experiences that
produce the same emotions.

00:20:17.746 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And they say oh,
this feels right.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:90%
No, that feels familiar.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.105 align:middle line:84%
Moving from the old
self to the new self

00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and crossing that river,
that void, that unknown,

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.700 align:middle line:84%
is the biological, the
neurological, the chemical,

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and even the genetic
death of the old self.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And once we understand that
that's what's occurring

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and that the best way
to predict your future

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.570 align:middle line:84%
is to create it right
in that unknown--

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.681 align:middle line:84%
and if you and I can
become comfortable

00:20:42.681 --> 00:20:45.180 align:middle line:84%
in that unknown-- that's where
the miraculous-- that's where

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:90%
the magic happens.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So getting people beyond
their emotional states that

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
keep them anchored to the
past is always the challenge.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're
thinking the same way

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's creating
the same emotions,

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.760 align:middle line:84%
they're keeping the
same genes turned on

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and the other genes turned off.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And now they're headed
for their genetic destiny.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is something
when we're talking about it,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.867 align:middle line:84%
everyone hears this and says,
yeah, that makes so much sense.

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we don't
know how to do it.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, doing it is
totally separate.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also, you're
talking about-- now,

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:90%
this is hard science.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
This is showing up on brain
maps and brain scans-- MRIs

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And you and Jeffrey Fannin have
been working together, as well,

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and doing, really, some amazing
work the last couple of years.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And so at this point,
I think it might

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:84%
be good to get into a couple
of real life case studies,

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
for example, of people
that were able to cross

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
that river of change, and
including in the negative.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was the name of
the man who had-- Oh, Sam Lock.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:90%
I have it right here.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Lund.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sam Lund.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sam Lund.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about Sam Lund

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
for a moment, because
this really demonstrates

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:84%
how severely we're
impacted by this.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.006 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to start going
into the positive examples.

00:22:01.006 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I wanted to
write this book differently

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to tell
stories of actual people

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that have been influenced
in the positive way

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and the negative way
by thought alone.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And so Sam Lund was a
retired shoe salesman living

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:90%
in the South.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was diagnosed
with esophageal cancer.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, esophageal
cancer was a death sentence.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And so he went to his
doctor and the doctor

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:84%
did the procedure to remove
most of the esophageal cancer.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And then he went through a
series of scans and tests,

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and one of the scans showed
that the esophageal cancer had

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:84%
metastasized--
spread to his liver--

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:90%
and that he had a positive scan.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And so once it reaches
the liver, in those days,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
it pretty much is-- there's
nothing that they could do.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So they said to him,
look, there's not

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:90%
a lot we can do at this point.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't have
much time to live.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.857 align:middle line:90%
What can we do to help you?

00:22:57.857 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look,
I just want to-- it

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
was October-- I just want to
make it through Christmas.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And then after Christmas
when I'm with my family,

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll be ready to die.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they did all the
necessary things to help him.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.610 align:middle line:84%
One week after
Christmas-- actually,

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:90%
it was New Year's Day-- he dies.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.612 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, did
he-- symptomatically,

00:23:15.612 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
did he become sicker and sicker
during this period of time?

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: No, no, no.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:90%
No, actually, he was healthy.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was healthy all
the way up through Christmas?

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: All the
way through Christmas,

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.391 align:middle line:90%
he was perfectly healthy.

00:23:23.391 --> 00:23:25.821 align:middle line:84%
All his vital signs and
everything-- his tests--

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:90%
perfect.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:26.632 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:26.632 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: The problem is
that when they did the autopsy

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:90%
on Sam's body--

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So he was healthy.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:90%
He enjoyed his family.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.052 align:middle line:90%
He died right after Christmas.

00:23:34.052 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And so right after
Christmas, he dies.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.012 align:middle line:84%
And they do an
autopsy on his body

00:23:39.012 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and they find out that it was
a false positive on the liver

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.110 align:middle line:84%
scan-- that he had a very small,
tiny little nodule, but not

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.000 align:middle line:84%
enough to kill him-- that
he died by thought alone.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when people begin to
wrap their mind around this--

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:57.780 align:middle line:84%
to realize how powerful we can
program ourselves if we accept,

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
believe, and surrender
to certain thoughts

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
without any analysis,
we're beginning

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:84%
to program our bodies
equal to our mind.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.244 align:middle line:90%
So that's a great example.

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.889 align:middle line:90%
What actually did he die of?

00:24:08.889 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: No one knows.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He just woke--
he didn't wake up.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: He died
by thought alone.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he stopped
his vital signs.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Somehow, he stopped
his vital signs by his belief.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.054 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:21.054 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So I like to tell
those kind of stories.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
thing called the nocebo.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to ask.

00:24:25.195 --> 00:24:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And the nocebo
is a kind of a funny thing.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.214 align:middle line:84%
Because a certain
percentage of people,

00:24:29.214 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
when you give them a placebo and
you tell them the side effects

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:84%
or they read about
the side effects,

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.680 align:middle line:84%
they get all the side
effects of the placebo

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:84%
without even taking
the actual drug.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about it,
people that take certain drugs

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and they all of a sudden get
fatigue or they get headaches

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:84%
or they get nausea, it's
because they're actually

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:84%
open to the thoughts that
are equal to those states.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I talk
about a young kid--

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
a graduate student who was
in a double blind placebo

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:90%
study for depression.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:84%
He's battled
depression in the past.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And he gets in an argument
with his girlfriend.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.965 align:middle line:84%
And out of frustration,
he opens the bottle

00:25:10.965 --> 00:25:12.614 align:middle line:90%
and takes all 27 pills.

00:25:12.614 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.863 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Runs out
of his apartment,

00:25:14.863 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:84%
writhing, convulsing,
falls on the ground crying.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.850 align:middle line:90%
And his heart rate's 80/40.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:84%
His respiratory
rate is super high.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.929 align:middle line:90%
His pulse is very high.

00:25:24.929 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:90%
They bring him to the hospital.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He appears
to be tanking.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah,
he's going down.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, they
finally find the drug

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:90%
that he had been taking.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
They call the doctor
from the placebo study.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
He comes in and he says,
you're taking the placebo.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.716 align:middle line:90%
And within seconds--

00:25:41.716 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love this story

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --his body
returns back to normalcy,

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty significant.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
That tells us how
powerful we really are.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really is.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So I
wanted to start off

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the book, story after
story, in that way,

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:84%
so that people begin to really
open their mind up to the idea

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:84%
that their thoughts do
matter and that we do program

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.157 align:middle line:84%
ourselves on a daily basis,
based on how we think and feel.

00:26:06.157 --> 00:26:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As I was
preparing for this,

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.986 align:middle line:84%
I had to go to the
dentist last week.

00:26:09.986 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And I had the book with me.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, what
are you reading there?

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, I'm preparing.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be interviewing
Dr. Joe next week.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And said well, tell
me about the book.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And I told him
just a little bit.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I've
got a story for you.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.000 align:middle line:84%
When he was in his
medical training

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.415 align:middle line:84%
and he was a resident
at-- I believe

00:26:27.415 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:84%
it was Harbor-- I don't know if
it's Harbor General in Southern

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:84%
California-- one of the
things they had to do

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.480 align:middle line:90%
was perform extractions.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said they
gave their clients

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
a choice of taking whatever
the common painkiller was

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:84%
at the time or taking the
super, extra, ultra good one.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's
not for everybody.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.870 align:middle line:84%
They do not prescribe
it to everybody.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But if they think there's
really going to be some trouble,

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:84%
they would give
them-- they called it

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.150 align:middle line:84%
the harborgesic
pill, which was--

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
he said it was a massive
jawbreaker-- sugar pill.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.079 align:middle line:84%
And he said they had
the same results,

00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and that people
would come in saying,

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:90%
oh, God, doc, those things work.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:90%
I need more harborgesics.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.879 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's demystify that.

00:27:12.879 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you've got
to give it a great name.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, they
give it a great name.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's no coincidence
Viagra is called Viagra,

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.599 align:middle line:90%
because it rhymes with Niagara.

00:27:20.599 --> 00:27:21.890 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of flow and--

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, well,
there's a lot of power there.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:23.335 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:90%
And Rogaine is grow and gain.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people
have to understand

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.310 align:middle line:84%
that there is association
with the name.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, if the doctor
is enthusiastic about it,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.204 align:middle line:90%
it enhances the efficacy.

00:27:36.204 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and they
tried to keep it from them.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:90%
It's special.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And then if you
try to keep it from them

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and you make it special and they
want it more-- the moment they

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.480 align:middle line:84%
want it more, the
moment they begin

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:90%
to anticipate the outcome.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And expectation is a
very important element

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.410 align:middle line:90%
in the placebo.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So when they've done these
studies on analgesics like

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
this, one of the things one
particular physician found out

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:84%
over time was that some of these
people were actually making

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.970 align:middle line:84%
their own endorphins and
morphine-like chemicals up

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.225 align:middle line:84%
to 200 times of what the
brain normally makes--

00:28:10.225 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --just by
expecting an outcome

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to
condition ourselves

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:90%
into a new state of being.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's how powerful
we really are.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's amazing
if we-- and that's

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.514 align:middle line:84%
the point of the
book, and that's

00:28:22.514 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:84%
what your work is--
allowing ourselves

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to go in a state of
saying, OK, right

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
here in this field
of information,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I already have the triggers
for my internal pharmacy

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.640 align:middle line:90%
and it can create anything.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they've been doing.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.786 align:middle line:84%
And people even respond once
they know it's a placebo.

00:28:37.786 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, there
was a couple great studies.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.448 align:middle line:84%
The one that was
probably the most famous

00:28:42.448 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:84%
is people that had irritable
bowel syndrome, which

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:84%
is a very difficult
condition to overcome.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But in this one
particular study,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.830 align:middle line:84%
they told the participants that
they were getting the placebo.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And a very significant
amount of those people

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:84%
got better, even
though they knew

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.780 align:middle line:84%
they were taking
their placebo, which

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
means the conscious mind has
a very small effect on what

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.145 align:middle line:90%
we program subconsciously.

00:29:06.145 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now this was
one of my favorite parts

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:90%
of the book.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:14.850 align:middle line:84%
The elderly gentlemen
who went to the monastery

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and had to pretend
they were young again.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.342 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this study.

00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:21.716 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
this is a study

00:29:21.716 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that was done by a Harvard
researcher named Ellen Langer.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And what she did
was she took a group

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:84%
of men in their 70s
and 80s to a monastery

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:84%
about two hours
north of Harvard.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they got
to the monastery,

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.010 align:middle line:84%
they asked these men
to pretend like they

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:90%
were 22 years younger.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And they asked them to immerse
themself in the environment.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Now the environment had
pictures of Marilyn Monroe, had

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
the Cuban Missile
Crisis on the radio.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It had pictures of magazines of
all different current events--

00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:00.892 align:middle line:84%
Mickey Mantle et cetera, et
cetera-- and the Kennedys.

00:30:00.892 --> 00:30:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And everything in
their environment

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.670 align:middle line:84%
reminded them of being
22 years younger.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.145 align:middle line:84%
But they were to move
into a state of being.

00:30:07.145 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
to pretend like they

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.310 align:middle line:90%
were 22 years younger.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, before they did that, they
measured certain core values

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.602 align:middle line:90%
on these men.

00:30:16.602 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
They measured their
finger lengths,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.559 align:middle line:84%
they measured their toe lengths,
they measured their height,

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
they measured their weight,
they measured their hearing,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.200 align:middle line:84%
they measured their eyesight,
they measured their range

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
of motion, their gait, and
their cognitive abilities.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.160 align:middle line:90%
So they had a baseline now.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Now for five days,
these guys pretended

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.080 align:middle line:90%
like they were 22 years younger.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the study, they

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:90%
remeasured all of those things.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
their finger lengths

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.850 align:middle line:84%
were longer, which means their
arthritis was going away.

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Their toe lengths were longer.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.620 align:middle line:90%
Their eyesight improved.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Their hearing improved.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:84%
They were taller,
they had less--

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.510 align:middle line:84%
they weighed less, their
range of motion improved.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And the most important
one was their cognition

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.490 align:middle line:90%
improved at least 60%.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gosh, it's-- what's
shocking is in five days,

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.425 align:middle line:84%
they had these
physiological changes.

00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
here's the cool part.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it begs the question,
who are we pretending to be?

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Or better yet, who are
we pretending not to be?

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And pretending is really just
changing the way you think.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:84%
They started
thinking differently.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.260 align:middle line:84%
They certainly started
acting differently.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, they started
feeling differently.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was the combination of
those things-- in other words,

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.410 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't say, finger
length, get longer.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.467 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't say,
eyesight, get better.

00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had to
recreate a condition--

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: They had to
move into a state of being.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:36.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:36.755 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And when they
moved into a state of being,

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:84%
they produced a
new level of mind.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Neurotransmitters then
activated neuropeptides.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Neuropeptides began to signal
new hormones-- epigenetically

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.170 align:middle line:90%
began to program new genes.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.360 align:middle line:90%
They began to make new proteins.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And proteins are responsible for
both the structure and function

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.501 align:middle line:84%
of your body, and every
cell makes a protein.

00:31:55.501 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
all their cells

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.930 align:middle line:90%
began to become reprogrammed.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden--
expression of protein

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:90%
is the expression of life.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And their biology
changed when they

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.960 align:middle line:90%
changed their state of being.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think a lot of people
are saying, oh, come on.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and again, I bring up
the time period-- five days.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.910 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to watch
a little video now.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.254 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about it
when the video's done.

00:32:20.254 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:90%
It's only 2 and 1/2 minutes.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.150 align:middle line:90%
It's your little video.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.750 align:middle line:84%
It's on the production
of proteins--

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:84%
this whole process
you just talked about.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think for us to keep
in mind that this is going on

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.580 align:middle line:84%
in how many trillions
of cells in our bodies?

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, the estimate's
between 70 trillion and 130

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:38.940 align:middle line:90%
trillion cells in your body.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.312 align:middle line:84%
This is happening in every
single cell of your body

00:32:41.312 --> 00:32:41.895 align:middle line:90%
all the time--

00:32:41.895 --> 00:32:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every nanosecond.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --every nanosecond,
in many different combinations

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:90%
and many different patterns.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening in every
cell except red blood cells.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And so the cell
receives the signal.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.800 align:middle line:84%
The signal then begins to
be accepted by the cell.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.900 align:middle line:84%
The chemical then
interacts with the DNA.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.420 align:middle line:84%
That chemical sends
instructions to the DNA.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:90%
The DNA is read.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we begin
to make proteins

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.414 align:middle line:84%
to reflect what the signal
is outside of the cell.

00:33:07.414 --> 00:33:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
the process that

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.410 align:middle line:84%
is enacted when
people see things

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:15.320 align:middle line:84%
like spontaneous remissions
and miraculous recoveries--

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.580 align:middle line:84%
is really a very logical
mechanistic thing that's

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:84%
happening, once it's impregnated
with the proper mindset,

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.292 align:middle line:84%
intention, emotion,
expectation, et cetera.

00:33:28.292 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: OK, before
we show the video,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.810 align:middle line:84%
let's go back to one
thought that I never

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.520 align:middle line:90%
finished when you asked me.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So then if we're living by the
same emotion every single day,

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and that's become the
common state of being,

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.386 align:middle line:84%
and emotions are a
record of the past,

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:43.260 align:middle line:84%
it means we're not
experiencing anything new.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.634 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part, our
body, as the unconscious mind,

00:33:45.634 --> 00:33:49.330 align:middle line:84%
is believing it's in the same
past experience 24 hours a day,

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:52.330 align:middle line:84%
seven days a week,
365 days a year.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So then in order to
begin to signal the gene,

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:01.790 align:middle line:84%
we have to make a decision
with such firm intention

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that the amplitude
of that decision

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.470 align:middle line:84%
carries a level of
energy that's greater

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:84%
than the hardwired
programs in our brain

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
addiction in the body,

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:13.142 align:middle line:84%
and the body literally has
to respond to the mind.

00:34:13.142 --> 00:34:15.600 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you have to
come out of your resting state.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And the inner
experience has to be

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.330 align:middle line:84%
greater than any past
experience and the amplitude

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:84%
of that inner experience is
enough of a intensity that

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:28.429 align:middle line:84%
begins to knock on the genetic
door that opens the door.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if it's
not equal to that state,

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.929 align:middle line:84%
then for the most part, we're
not going to program a change.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:35.428 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can't be passive--
oh, I'd like to feel better.

00:34:35.428 --> 00:34:36.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I've had it.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm done.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not taking this anymore.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: And good.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.601 align:middle line:84%
So we'll show this
and then I'll talk

00:34:40.601 --> 00:34:43.080 align:middle line:84%
about a case history of
someone that actually did it.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's take a
look at this little animation.

00:34:46.005 --> 00:34:47.500 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>The events going
on in our cells

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:84%
can be compared to an
orchestra playing a symphony.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.530 align:middle line:84%
There are many
different parts being

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:84%
played by a wide
range of instruments.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Here we see an example of a
protein in short supply found

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.750 align:middle line:84%
in the external
environment of the cell.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Proteins interact with
specific receptors

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.630 align:middle line:84%
on the cell's outer
membrane to trigger

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.490 align:middle line:84%
a cascade of events
leading to the expression

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:16.960 align:middle line:84%
of specific genes and the
production of this protein.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Membranes regulate the
movement of substances

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:24.010 align:middle line:84%
in and out of the cell through
a wide range of mechanisms.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:84%
In this case, receptors
on the surface

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:84%
trigger signaling
mechanisms involving

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.330 align:middle line:84%
other proteins in
the cell's cytoplasm.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.930 align:middle line:84%
In the cytoplasm, the
signaling elements

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.770 align:middle line:84%
are involved in a
cascade of events.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:84%
The final components
interact with the DNA

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.390 align:middle line:84%
in the nucleus at
very specific sites

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:47.820 align:middle line:84%
to begin the expression
of the desired gene.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Gene expression is complex.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:84%
To start transcription,
several proteins

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:57.800 align:middle line:84%
are often required to bind
regulatory elements on the DNA.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.930 align:middle line:84%
This step in the process
is where DNA is read

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and a complimentary
strand of RNA is produced.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:08.420 align:middle line:84%
The RNA has to undergo
many changes, including

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.750 align:middle line:84%
the systematic removal of
RNA sections not needed

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.620 align:middle line:84%
to code for the
desired proteins.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:84%
RNA then takes the
information encoded

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.690 align:middle line:90%
in the DNA out of the nucleus.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:22.360 align:middle line:90%


00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.330 align:middle line:84%
In a process called
translation, ribosomes

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.200 align:middle line:84%
interact with the
messenger RNA and transfer

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.630 align:middle line:84%
RNAs to create the chain
of amino acids coded

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:90%
for on the DNA.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.090 align:middle line:84%
This amino acid chain undergoes
changes in configuration,

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.680 align:middle line:90%
including specific folding.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Each protein takes on a 3D shape
required for a functional end

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.590 align:middle line:90%
product.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:84%
As the new protein
leaves the cell

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and takes on its
role in the body,

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:57.160 align:middle line:84%
the cycles of cell function
and gene expression carry on.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:84%
The amazing symphony of
cellular interactions

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:03.265 align:middle line:84%
continues and the music,
which is life, plays on.

00:37:03.265 --> 00:37:07.338 align:middle line:90%

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:09.900 align:middle line:84%

we have to remember

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.800 align:middle line:84%
that what we're seeing
there, which is matter,

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.730 align:middle line:84%
is what, less than a
hundredth of a percent?

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:24.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words, 99.9999% of
every single-- the composition

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:84%
of every atom in
the body is space.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.395 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:37:28.395 --> 00:37:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Information and space.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:31.541 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about-- go ahead and tell

00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:84%
us what you were going to,
but the whole matrix of how

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.580 align:middle line:84%
the information can
instantaneously then change

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.080 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the example
you were going to tell us.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:41.305 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
the receptor sites

00:37:41.305 --> 00:37:43.430 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of our
cell-- this is science--

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.672 align:middle line:84%
are 100 times more sensitive
to electromagnetism

00:37:46.672 --> 00:37:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and frequency then
they are to chemistry.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.966 align:middle line:84%
Chemistry's the downward
causation of electromagnetism.

00:37:50.966 --> 00:37:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So when you
are moved by something

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and the hair on the back
of your neck stands up,

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:84%
that's when the cell's
getting new electromagnetic

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.240 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.160 align:middle line:84%
That's when the body is
responding to the mind.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.251 align:middle line:84%
So in a lot of the
studies that we

00:38:09.251 --> 00:38:11.000 align:middle line:84%
did when we were looking
at all the people

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.333 align:middle line:84%
that healed themselves of all
these different conditions

00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that we observe, one of the
things that was consistent

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.280 align:middle line:84%
over and over again
is that the person

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.650 align:middle line:84%
reached such a
level of wholeness--

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:24.370 align:middle line:84%
such a level of self
satisfaction, such

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.200 align:middle line:84%
a level of
completion-- that they

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:84%
could care less whether they
had the disease any longer.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
moment it went away.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's funny because
we wait for our healing

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:36.920 align:middle line:90%
in order to give thanks.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.810 align:middle line:84%
We wait for our relationship
in order to feel love.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.770 align:middle line:84%
We wait for our
wealth to show up

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:43.560 align:middle line:84%
in order to feel
abundance or freedom.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.680 align:middle line:84%
We wait for our
success to be in power.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.330 align:middle line:84%
We wait for the mystical
moment to feel awe.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:52.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the old model of
reality-- of cause and effect.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.070 align:middle line:84%
The quantum model
of reality, really,

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.830 align:middle line:90%
is about causing an effect.

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:58.240 align:middle line:84%
That means that you
have to feel wholeness

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:90%
before the healing occurs.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel love before
the relationship shows up.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel empowered
before the success is present.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to be in awe of life
before the mystical moment

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:09.570 align:middle line:90%
occurs.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you have
to feel free and abundant

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.990 align:middle line:84%
in order for your
wealth to appear.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.157 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of the
new model of reality,

00:39:17.157 --> 00:39:18.740 align:middle line:84%
because that's when
we're conditioning

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.310 align:middle line:90%
the body to a new mind.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to tell you a
story because it just happened.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I was in Europe just
a little ways back,

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:90%
and I was in Barcelona.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.427 align:middle line:84%
And I was completing a
portion of my lecture,

00:39:31.427 --> 00:39:32.760 align:middle line:90%
and I was walking off the stage.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And this woman
handed me an envelope

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.196 align:middle line:90%
as I was walking off the stage.

00:39:36.196 --> 00:39:37.320 align:middle line:90%
And I walked off the stage.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.986 align:middle line:84%
On the break, I went
into the green room

00:39:38.986 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:90%
and I read this letter.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And the letter was
so moving, Regina,

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that I had to ask this
woman to come on the stage

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.696 align:middle line:90%
and tell the story.

00:39:45.696 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's not in
the placebo book,

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:84%
but here's a great
example of how

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.430 align:middle line:84%
someone turned
their life around.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:52.870 align:middle line:90%
This woman is a psychotherapist.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:53.750 align:middle line:90%
She's a professional.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.920 align:middle line:90%
She's a successful woman.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.800 align:middle line:90%
She has children.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.960 align:middle line:84%
A couple years ago, she's
in the shower getting

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.320 align:middle line:84%
ready on a Sunday morning,
and her children are playing.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And her husband says
goodbye to his children,

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:06.920 align:middle line:84%
opens the bathroom door
while she's in the shower

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and yells goodbye, goes to the
tallest building in Amsterdam

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and jumps off the top of the
building and commits suicide.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, the amplitude
of the experience,

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:21.030 align:middle line:84%
emotionally-- the emotional
quotient from that even created

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
shock, created a lot of
anger, a lot of resentment,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of victimization, a lot
of pain, and a lot of suffering.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.765 align:middle line:84%
That's the side effect
of the experience.

00:40:29.765 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.223 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now, what
most people don't know

00:40:32.223 --> 00:40:34.860 align:middle line:84%
is that when you think
about a past experience that

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:84%
has a high emotional quotient,
you produce the same chemistry

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.300 align:middle line:84%
in your brain and body as
if the event was happening.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So her body, as the
unconscious mind,

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:84%
didn't know the difference
between the actual event that

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.070 align:middle line:84%
occurred and the memories
that she was recreating.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So her body was we
re-experiencing the same event

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.890 align:middle line:90%
50 to 100 times in one day.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's that redundancy that
begins to condition the body

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.340 align:middle line:90%
to be in the past.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So now the experience turns into
a mood-- one long, emotional

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.780 align:middle line:90%
reaction for days.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And if we keep the
same refractory period

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:10.540 align:middle line:84%
of that emotion continuing
on for weeks or months,

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.110 align:middle line:90%
that's called a temperament.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So she has one long
emotional reaction

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:16.640 align:middle line:90%
that's connected to this event.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you asked her why she was
suffering or why she was angry

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:84%
or why she was
resentful, she would say,

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I am this way because
of this experience

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.630 align:middle line:84%
that happened to
me nine months ago.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody in
her life, of course,

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.490 align:middle line:84%
was reflecting back to
her her new personality

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that was connected
to this experience.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And so she began
to subconsciously

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and unconsciously
accept, believe,

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and surrender to
the thoughts that

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.440 align:middle line:84%
are equal to this
emotional state.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
In a very short
amount of time, she

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.629 align:middle line:84%
develops total
paralysis in her body.

00:41:47.629 --> 00:41:48.670 align:middle line:90%
She can't get out of bed.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:49.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And so they
take her to the doctor.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.940 align:middle line:84%
The doctor cannot find anything
physically wrong with her.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they name the condition
"neuritis," but you and I would

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:03.491 align:middle line:84%
understand that she physically
manifested pain in her body,

00:42:03.491 --> 00:42:03.990 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.656 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:04.656 --> 00:42:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So now
she can't work.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.060 align:middle line:90%
She can't see clients.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:12.920 align:middle line:84%
She can't take care of her
children, and she has no money.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So now her stress levels
go up even higher.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's the hormones
of stress, long term,

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.945 align:middle line:84%
that push the genetic
buttons that create disease.

00:42:19.945 --> 00:42:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So as she's
thinking about her past,

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:27.750 align:middle line:84%
she's beginning to-- her
thoughts are literally

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.280 align:middle line:90%
making her more sick, OK?

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.187 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:42:30.187 --> 00:42:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: After she
develops this neuritis

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.151 align:middle line:84%
and she has no
job, and no money,

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and she can't take
care of her kids,

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:39.075 align:middle line:84%
and her husband's passed-- in
a very short amount of time

00:42:39.075 --> 00:42:40.450 align:middle line:84%
after that, two
months later, she

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.110 align:middle line:84%
develops these very
large ulcerations

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.210 align:middle line:84%
in all of her mucous
membranes in her body--

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:49.554 align:middle line:84%
in her mouth, her esophagus, her
stomach, her vagina, her anus,

00:42:49.554 --> 00:42:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and her bladder.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Now she can't eat.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How painful.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: She's
even in more pain.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:90%
She's manifesting more pain.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.005 align:middle line:84%
But this is how the body is
being signaled genetically.

00:42:57.005 --> 00:42:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We're
turning on-- we're

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:00.920 align:middle line:84%
signaling the wrong
genes in the wrong ways.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's a scientific fact
that the hormones of stress

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.640 align:middle line:84%
down regulate genes that
create disease long term.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So by her living that
same stress response,

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.630 align:middle line:84%
she's signaling the wrong
genes in the wrong ways,

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and her body's
beginning to break down.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So in a very short amount
of time after this,

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.880 align:middle line:84%
she now develops
esophageal cancer.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And now she's in trouble.

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Now the stress from the cancer,
the stress from the disease,

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.300 align:middle line:84%
the fact that she
can't eat, the fact

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.530 align:middle line:84%
that she can't take
care of her children,

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.420 align:middle line:84%
the fact she has no
money, she has no job,

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.190 align:middle line:84%
is all adding to
her stress levels.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:37.136 align:middle line:90%
You get the idea.

00:43:37.136 --> 00:43:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So she
came to a workshop

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that we had in Holland about a
year and a half, two years ago.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:90%
And she came in on a walker.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And I remember,
because I remember

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.070 align:middle line:84%
her sitting in the left
hand side of the audience.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And she began to embrace
some of the information

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.844 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about in this
book and in our workshops.

00:43:57.844 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And she realized
that she probably

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.010 align:middle line:84%
was signaling the wrong
gene in the wrong way.

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And it started to
make sense to her.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:05.530 align:middle line:84%
She started doing
her meditations,

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.200 align:middle line:84%
but she was struggling
because she was so

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.190 align:middle line:90%
anchored to her past.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.500 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't think
greater than how she felt,

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.800 align:middle line:90%
but she kept going.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And she stepped
into the river of change.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And she became conscious of
all her unconscious thoughts,

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.130 align:middle line:90%
her behaviors, and emotions.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:22.144 align:middle line:84%
And now she was serious
about making a change.

00:44:22.144 --> 00:44:24.310 align:middle line:84%
She came to an advanced--
progressive workshop there

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:25.680 align:middle line:90%
we had in New York.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.590 align:middle line:84%
She flew from
Holland to New York.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was a more
advanced event.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And I pushed the group,
because they were ready to go.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And I always say, right on
the other side of your fear

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:36.510 align:middle line:90%
is courage.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Right on the other side
of your pain is freedom.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Right on the other side of
your anger is compassion.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:41.510 align:middle line:90%
It's the same energy.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just trapped in the body.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So she had a breakthrough
in this event.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And out of nowhere,
she said-- she

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:50.690 align:middle line:84%
was saying this on the
stage-- in the middle of one

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:52.570 align:middle line:84%
meditation, she had
a vision that she

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.430 align:middle line:84%
was standing in front of an
audience telling everybody

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:56.430 align:middle line:90%
that she healed herself.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:90%
She didn't create the vision.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:59.600 align:middle line:90%
She had the vision.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So she had that
breakthrough at that event.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:07.162 align:middle line:84%
And she went home, and
for every single day,

00:45:07.162 --> 00:45:08.120 align:middle line:90%
she did her meditation.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.080 align:middle line:90%
She took the placebo.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.990 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
for antidepression,

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:13.240 align:middle line:84%
you take the placebo for
six weeks or eight weeks

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.700 align:middle line:84%
to remind yourself
of your future.

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, she moved into a new
state of being every day.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the beauty.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.960 align:middle line:84%
She said to herself, I am not
getting up from my meditation

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.100 align:middle line:84%
every day until I'm
in love with my life.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about this.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:28.500 align:middle line:90%
To the materialist--

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.209 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:45:29.209 --> 00:45:30.833 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: To the
materialist, there's

00:45:30.833 --> 00:45:32.500 align:middle line:84%
no reason to be in
love with your life.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.450 align:middle line:90%
In her case, she's got cancer.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:37.627 align:middle line:84%
She's got esophageal
ulcerations.

00:45:37.627 --> 00:45:39.710 align:middle line:84%
She's got ulcerations on
all her mucous membranes.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:40.330 align:middle line:90%
She can't eat.

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:41.090 align:middle line:90%
She can't walk.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:41.740 align:middle line:90%
She's in pain.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.830 align:middle line:90%
She can't get out of bed.

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:43.760 align:middle line:90%
She can't take care of her kids.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.640 align:middle line:90%
She has no money.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.630 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason to
be in love with life.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:49.900 align:middle line:84%
But she understood
that those emotions

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.940 align:middle line:90%
kept her anchored to the past.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So every single day, she
overcame her emotional body

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and she got up in
love with life.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was that emotional
quotient, every day,

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that started to build that began
to knock on the genetic door.

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Now as she began to turn
the battleship around,

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and unmemorized
the emotions that

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:11.600 align:middle line:84%
kept her anchored to the
past, it got easier every day.

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the word meditation
means to become familiar with.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.110 align:middle line:84%
You become familiar
with the old self.

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So no thoughts, no
behaviors, no emotions

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.680 align:middle line:84%
cause you to go
unconscious again

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.400 align:middle line:84%
because you're so
conscious of them.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you become
familiar with a new self--

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.270 align:middle line:84%
new thoughts, new
behaviors, and new emotions.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And every day, she did it.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the cool part.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.880 align:middle line:84%
After a certain amount of
time, she started to get happy.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.340 align:middle line:90%
She started to feel whole.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.420 align:middle line:84%
She no longer was
thinking about her past.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And she stood on that stage
that day and she said,

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I just came from the
doctor a week ago.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I have no evidence
of cancer in my body.

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was
in Barcelona a couple

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.430 align:middle line:90%
weeks ago or so?

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.524 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: This was
a month or so ago.

00:46:51.524 --> 00:46:56.450 align:middle line:84%
I have no ulcerations in
any of my mucus membranes.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:57.630 align:middle line:90%
I have no pain.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't need any assistance
in walking any longer.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:02.165 align:middle line:90%
And I have a new husband.

00:47:02.165 --> 00:47:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [GASP] Wow.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And I
said, let me ask

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.730 align:middle line:84%
you a question in
front of this audience.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Were there days
that you didn't feel

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.350 align:middle line:90%
like doing your meditation?

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.810 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, my God, in the
beginning, every single day.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.540 align:middle line:90%
I said, did you do it anyway?

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.080 align:middle line:84%
She said, absolutely, and
I was so glad that I did.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Because every time I overcame
a small aspect of myself,

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I got a piece of
myself back, and I

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.070 align:middle line:90%
started to love myself more.

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:29.630 align:middle line:84%
When she finally
reached the point

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:31.200 align:middle line:84%
where she was so
happy with herself

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.845 align:middle line:84%
she could no longer--
she didn't care

00:47:32.845 --> 00:47:35.470 align:middle line:84%
she had the disease any longer,
that's the moment it went away.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:38.974 align:middle line:84%
Because the disease existed
in the old personality.

00:47:38.974 --> 00:47:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: She was
a new personality.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:41.702 align:middle line:90%
She was somebody else.

00:47:41.702 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:90%
The disease exists in--

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She'd crossed
the river of time, too.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: She was a new self.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A new self.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:48.106 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: She'd crossed
that river of change

00:47:48.106 --> 00:47:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and she was literally
somebody else.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And the whole beauty
behind all of this

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.660 align:middle line:84%
is that if you see someone
dance the salsa well,

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.440 align:middle line:90%
you'll dance the salsa better.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.860 align:middle line:84%
If you see someone hit a tennis
ball like Serena Williams,

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.295 align:middle line:84%
you'll hit a tennis ball
like Serena Williams--

00:48:04.295 --> 00:48:05.170 align:middle line:90%
you'll hit it better.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.110 align:middle line:84%
If you see someone lead
with compassion and courage

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:10.975 align:middle line:84%
in their life, you will lead
with compassion and courage

00:48:10.975 --> 00:48:11.910 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you see someone
stand on the stage

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and tell a story of how
they overcame their disease,

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.680 align:middle line:84%
you're more prone to accept,
believe, and surrender,

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.580 align:middle line:84%
without any analysis, that
it's possible for you.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So she is the living
example of truth.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And she is a different
person today.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask her
about her disease

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and you ask her about
her husband-- ex-husband

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.890 align:middle line:84%
jumping off the roof
and committing suicide,

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:42.910 align:middle line:84%
she'll tell you that that
was her greatest lesson.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Her disease was her
greatest teacher.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you
overcome that-- when

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.860 align:middle line:84%
you overcome your past like
that-- when you overcome

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.140 align:middle line:84%
an emotion that keeps you
connected to the past,

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that's called wisdom, and
that's the name of the game.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.680 align:middle line:84%
If we don't overcome that
emotion, then we'll always say,

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I am this way because of this
event, which really means,

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:05.110 align:middle line:84%
I was altered 20 years ago or
10 years ago or five years ago,

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and I froze, and I
haven't evolved since.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:11.980 align:middle line:84%
But when she overcame
that emotion,

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.070 align:middle line:84%
the side effect of
that is called wisdom.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And the disease no longer
exists in that body.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.160 align:middle line:84%
It exists in the
old personality.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's one of the
most inspirational stories

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:22.590 align:middle line:90%
I've ever heard.

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:24.298 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah,
she's an amazing woman.

00:49:24.298 --> 00:49:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just saw her in
Holland a few weeks ago.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And she's beautiful and she's
radiant and she loves her life.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she said to me--
at the end of the talk

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.810 align:middle line:84%
when she was on the stage in
Barcelona, she said, you know,

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm so in love with my life.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:45.697 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you
created from the place

00:49:45.697 --> 00:49:47.030 align:middle line:90%
of being in love with your life.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Of course you're going
to love your life.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's kind
of, what else is there to say?

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:55.812 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I just have a
couple more questions anyway.

00:49:55.812 --> 00:49:56.645 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: [LAUGHS]

00:49:56.645 --> 00:49:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's almost
like, I'm done.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.580 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.042 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing that story.

00:50:01.042 --> 00:50:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But a couple
things you said there--

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.091 align:middle line:84%
and you talk about
this in the book--

00:50:05.091 --> 00:50:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and this is the notion of the
persistence and the rehearsal

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:84%
again and again-- reprogramming
this reality-- whatever

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.940 align:middle line:84%
the reality is into
the desired outcome.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So the rehearsal
and the gratitude--

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.610 align:middle line:84%
just speak for a
moment more about that.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.151 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, I think that
you and I have been hypnotized

00:50:22.151 --> 00:50:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and conditioned
into believing we

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.970 align:middle line:90%
need a reason to give thanks.

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:26.650 align:middle line:84%
We wait for something
outside of us

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.390 align:middle line:84%
to change how we
feel inside of us.

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we feel
differently inside of us,

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.150 align:middle line:84%
we acknowledge whatever
it was outside of us.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:34.756 align:middle line:90%
That's how gratitude works.

00:50:34.756 --> 00:50:36.505 align:middle line:84%
The event happens, and
you give gratitude.

00:50:36.505 --> 00:50:39.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
the emotional signature

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:45.260 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude, gratitude means
the event has already happened

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.440 align:middle line:90%
or it's happening to you.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.687 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to
marry a clear intention,

00:50:50.687 --> 00:50:52.270 align:middle line:84%
you rehearse what
your future is going

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:55.100 align:middle line:84%
to be like-- you can change
the circuitry in your brain

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.285 align:middle line:84%
to look like the event
has already occurred.

00:50:57.285 --> 00:50:58.826 align:middle line:84%
That's what neuroscience
says, that's

00:50:58.826 --> 00:51:00.070 align:middle line:90%
what mental rehearsal does.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So now your brain is no
longer a record of the past.

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Now it's a map to the future.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you marry that
rehearsal of a clear intention

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and you review your
behaviors and your choices

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and you review those
experiences and you're

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.410 align:middle line:84%
intent on that, but
then you marry it

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:18.580 align:middle line:84%
with the elevated
emotion of gratitude,

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.410 align:middle line:84%
your body, as the
unconscious mind,

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.360 align:middle line:84%
believes that the event
has already occurred.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're signaling
new genes in new ways

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:26.857 align:middle line:84%
because, to your body,
it already happened.

00:51:26.857 --> 00:51:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.522 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So the materialists
will wait for their healing

00:51:31.522 --> 00:51:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to happen, and then
give gratitude.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.720 align:middle line:84%
We say the quantum mind already
experienced the healing.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So we don't get up
from our meditations

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:42.210 align:middle line:84%
praying that our
prayers are answered.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.971 align:middle line:84%
We get up from our meditations
as if our prayers are already

00:51:44.971 --> 00:51:45.470 align:middle line:90%
answered.

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And
that absolute state

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.090 align:middle line:84%
of being where mind
and body are like

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that, if you practice
that every day,

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:54.770 align:middle line:84%
it will begin to
become familiar to you.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.680 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to turn it
on in a matter of seconds.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.956 align:middle line:84%
And so then when you have--
and we've seen this on so many

00:52:00.956 --> 00:52:02.830 align:middle line:84%
of our brain scans, and
all of our students--

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have
many of them in here.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With the stories that
go along with the scans, yes.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:08.741 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But one of
the cool things that

00:52:08.741 --> 00:52:13.370 align:middle line:84%
happens in our workshops is
we're capturing amplitudes

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.840 align:middle line:84%
of energy in people's brains
that are 10 times, 20 times,

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:21.600 align:middle line:84%
30 times normal, which means
the inner experience is greater

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.100 align:middle line:90%
than any past experience.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moment--
the rewriting the program.

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:28.027 align:middle line:84%
That's the field moving
through their body.

00:52:28.027 --> 00:52:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's
the field moving

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:31.370 align:middle line:84%
through their nervous
system, and we're

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:33.140 align:middle line:90%
capturing that in real time.

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.512 align:middle line:90%
They can't make that happen.

00:52:35.512 --> 00:52:37.720 align:middle line:84%
You can't say to the person,
make your brain do that.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.690 align:middle line:90%
It's happening to them.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And when it happens to
them to such a degree,

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.300 align:middle line:84%
the inner experience
becoming more

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.127 align:middle line:84%
real than any past experience is
a moment they'll never forget.

00:52:47.127 --> 00:52:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moment that
circuits in their brain

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:50.090 align:middle line:90%
are rewritten.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moment the
energy and the emotion

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:55.140 align:middle line:84%
is greater than the
past experience.

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moment the
body responds to a new mind.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some of
them are even ecstatic.

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:02.212 align:middle line:84%
You're even mapping
ecstatic experiences

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that have changed--
altered people's realities.

00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Oh, most
of the time, they are.

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time,
people are in bliss.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.882 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:07.882 --> 00:53:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I always say,
you can control that,

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.830 align:middle line:84%
but why would you
want to? [LAUGHS]

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, why
would you want to?

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:14.824 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you've done in
this book that I really like

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:18.012 align:middle line:84%
is you've actually written out
the script for the meditation

00:53:18.012 --> 00:53:20.220 align:middle line:84%
at the end-- that a person
can either go to the site,

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.110 align:middle line:84%
buy the one that's
already recorded,

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:24.640 align:middle line:84%
or even record it
in their own voice

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.645 align:middle line:84%
and go through this
very deep process

00:53:27.645 --> 00:53:30.670 align:middle line:84%
that-- interestingly,
what really sets it aside

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:35.050 align:middle line:84%
from other meditations is you're
looking at and putting them

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:37.130 align:middle line:90%
in a feeling of the space.

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're taking
them out of the material

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.020 align:middle line:84%
model into the space of
the field of intention--

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.090 align:middle line:90%
the field of mind.

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:45.235 align:middle line:90%
Well, think about this.

00:53:45.235 --> 00:53:46.940 align:middle line:84%
The majority of the time,
where's our attention?

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Mostly on objects and things--

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: --people and places.

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we're focusing
on the particle--

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or pain or disease
or a broken foot, yeah.

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:56.312 align:middle line:10%
And the more you live by
the hormones of stress,

00:53:56.312 --> 00:53:57.770 align:middle line:10%
the more you're a
materialist-- the

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:00.010 align:middle line:10%
more you focus on the
particle and less on the wave.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:00.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.686 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: So
we're asking people

00:54:01.686 --> 00:54:03.120 align:middle line:10%
to take their
attention off matter

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.980 align:middle line:10%
and put it on energy
and information.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.320 align:middle line:10%
And when you do that-- we've
measured it over and over

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.310 align:middle line:10%
again-- the brain
gets very coherent.

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:11.630 align:middle line:10%
The brain gets very organized.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:14.050 align:middle line:10%
And when the brain's
coherent, you're coherent.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.470 align:middle line:84%
When the brain works
well, you work well.

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As I said, you've
outdone yourself on this one.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.735 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Oh, good.

00:54:19.735 --> 00:54:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dr. Joe,
absolutely amazing book.

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have second discussion.

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Cool.

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:27.185 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: In our
next discussion,

00:54:27.185 --> 00:54:29.980 align:middle line:10%
we're going to dive into the
deep end of the quantum soup

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:30.680 align:middle line:10%
pool.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.200 align:middle line:10%
If our bodies are
made out of 99.999--

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.870 align:middle line:10%
you get it-- percent
of space, than what

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:37.250 align:middle line:10%
penetrates that space?

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.790 align:middle line:84%
As we've talked
about, information.

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence guides
the direction

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.710 align:middle line:90%
of our physical reality,

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and it can be applied
not only to ourselves,

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:47.260 align:middle line:84%
but others, through remote
healing and much more.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So join us for this
next conversation.

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Until later, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.310 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:54:56.310 --> 00:55:10.934 align:middle line:90%
