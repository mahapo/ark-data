[THEME MUSIC] >>
REGINA MEREDITH:

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:23.815 align:middle line:84%
According Alan Butler
and Janet Walter,

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:26.777 align:middle line:84%
America was founded on
a cult of goddesses.

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:28.862 align:middle line:84%
They say a handful
of Venus families

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.156 align:middle line:84%
were at the core of the layout
of the architecture and culture

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:33.575 align:middle line:90%
of the developing nation.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.827 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure this is all
news to many of you,

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.372 align:middle line:90%
so stay tuned and welcome, Alan.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.625 align:middle line:84%
Alan, I'm so glad you could come
in and be here with us today.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> ALAN BUTLER: It's a
great pleasure to be here.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.129 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about--
most people think of the US

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.507 align:middle line:84%
as having been found
by men, for men.

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:50.926 align:middle line:84%
How did you come about the
feminine slant on the founding

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:52.135 align:middle line:90%
of the new world?

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.513 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: Well, it actually
goes back quite a long time.

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:59.559 align:middle line:84%
My original research writing
was into the ancient history

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.438 align:middle line:84%
of Europe, going right
back to Stone Age times

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.358 align:middle line:84%
and to the people
who built structures

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:08.652 align:middle line:90%
like Stonehenge, for example.

00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:11.655 align:middle line:84%
And they were people
whose religion

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:17.244 align:middle line:84%
was based upon a kind
of a tripartite deity.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.664 align:middle line:84%
They believed in
the god who they saw

00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:23.583 align:middle line:90%
as being the Sun or the sky.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:27.545 align:middle line:84%
They believed in the Earth
as being the great mother.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:31.717 align:middle line:84%
And they were closer to her
than to any other deity.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.386 align:middle line:84%
And they also believed
in a third deity,

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:40.767 align:middle line:84%
who was the son of the god-- who
was perpetually born and died

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:44.938 align:middle line:84%
because he represented the
grain, the wheat and the barley

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.857 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.318 align:middle line:90%
So it's a long story.

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.152 align:middle line:84%
And we only really know
about their religion

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:55.615 align:middle line:84%
because of contemporary cultures
like the Minoans in Crete

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.868 align:middle line:84%
who were at the
same time and who

00:01:57.868 --> 00:01:59.661 align:middle line:84%
seem to have had exactly
the same religion.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.892 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's my belief--
and in fact, there's

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:05.432 align:middle line:84%
plenty of proof
to show that it is

00:02:05.432 --> 00:02:07.745 align:middle line:84%
so-- that those
original beliefs that

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:11.965 align:middle line:84%
went alongside the fantastic
mathematical and astronomical

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.761 align:middle line:84%
knowledge these people had were
maintained and perpetuated.

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.429 align:middle line:90%
They never died.

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:84%
They were hidden within society,
in certain groups of people.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.976 align:middle line:84%
And they were guarded
very carefully,

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.687 align:middle line:84%
because when they came
up against the advent

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:29.649 align:middle line:84%
of new religions like
Christianity and Judaism

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.736 align:middle line:84%
and Islam, then the
people concerned

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
were likely to be persecuted if
they were seen to be venerating

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.117 align:middle line:90%
a female deity.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:42.996 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, this
was hidden for generation

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.415 align:middle line:90%
upon generation.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:49.836 align:middle line:84%
And we found-- this was with
a previous associate of mine

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:54.257 align:middle line:84%
called Chris Knight-- we
found that the astrology

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:58.678 align:middle line:84%
and astronomy, which
they were using,

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.806 align:middle line:84%
had been perpetuated
within society.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:03.767 align:middle line:84%
And it kept cropping
up time and again,

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.727 align:middle line:90%
as, indeed, did the religion.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But you had to
know where to look.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.607 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
which always betrayed it

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.735 align:middle line:84%
was that these people had
created a very special kind

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:17.197 align:middle line:84%
of measuring system which was
extremely accurate, but very

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.866 align:middle line:84%
different than any
that we use today.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.869 align:middle line:84%
And it was based upon a
unit of measurement called

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.747 align:middle line:84%
the megalithic yard,
which was rediscovered

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:29.584 align:middle line:84%
by a Scottish professor
of engineering

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.337 align:middle line:84%
when he measured a lot of
the megalithic monuments,

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.176 align:middle line:84%
like Stonehenge, and Avebury,
and lots of the others.

00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:37.759 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What would that unit
of measurement look like today

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.559 align:middle line:90%
in feet or meters?

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: It would be 2.722
feet, so not so far off a yard,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.809 align:middle line:90%
but not quite as big as a yard.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.103 align:middle line:84%
Now, this particular
measurement seemed

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:84%
to have disappeared completely
after the Bronze Age times.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.486 align:middle line:84%
But then quite suddenly
and quite mysteriously,

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.405 align:middle line:90%
Chris and I found it.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:02.868 align:middle line:84%
And we found it in the South of
England in a city called Bath.

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:06.456 align:middle line:84%
Now, Bath had been largely
rebuilt in the 18th century.

00:04:06.456 --> 00:04:08.081 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that the
guy who'd done it,

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:13.753 align:middle line:84%
a guy called John Wood, was
both a Freemason and a member

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.173 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient order of Druids.

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:20.427 align:middle line:84%
He left his credentials
all over the city of Bath,

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.971 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the stone
measurement that he used

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:27.517 align:middle line:84%
and friezes that were carved
with strong Masonic symbols.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And right in the
center of his work

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.397 align:middle line:90%
is a place called King's Circus.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:36.776 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a guy on the
television who was actually

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.654 align:middle line:90%
doing an expose of Bath.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:44.784 align:middle line:84%
And he happened to mention the
dimensions of King's Circus,

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:49.289 align:middle line:84%
which is a circular, grassy area
with beautiful Georgian houses

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.415 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:51.917 align:middle line:84%
And when he mentioned
this, I nearly

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.753 align:middle line:84%
fell off the sofa at
home, because I recognized

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.755 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions
immediately as being

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same as the
dimensions of Stonehenge.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.469 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that Stonehenge
was measurable in terms

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.763 align:middle line:90%
of this megalithic yard.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So then we went on to
find the megalithic yard

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.895 align:middle line:90%
all over the city of Bath.

00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:11.353 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Always
in circular form?

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.146 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Not necessarily, no.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.398 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it was straight lines.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.527 align:middle line:84%
There is a great,
big key there, which

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:21.154 align:middle line:84%
is an intersection
of several roads.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:25.325 align:middle line:84%
And that is measurable in
terms of the megalithic yard.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.285 align:middle line:84%
But we couldn't find
anywhere else in Britain,

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
because there was nowhere
else which at the time

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.125 align:middle line:84%
had been completely
knocked down and renovated.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.461 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't
start from scratch.

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.505 align:middle line:90%
So we decided to cast around.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.299 align:middle line:84%
And the first city that
came into our mind, which

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.218 align:middle line:84%
would be a really
good candidate,

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.387 align:middle line:84%
would be Washington,
DC, because it

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:50.725 align:middle line:84%
was built exactly the same time
as parts of Bath were rebuilt.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.061 align:middle line:90%
And we were astounded.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.814 align:middle line:84%
There is not a section of
Central Washington, DC,

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:59.651 align:middle line:84%
that is not measurable in
units of the megalithic yard,

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:04.447 align:middle line:84%
and, specifically, in 366
megalithic yards, which

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:08.618 align:middle line:84%
is the optimum measurement which
our ancient ancestors used.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
366 was a really
important number

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.706 align:middle line:84%
to them for all
sorts of reasons.

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And to find it in Washington,
DC, was an absolute revelation.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.213 align:middle line:84%
Well, it just so happened
that I was called to America

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:24.634 align:middle line:84%
soon after this to do some
work with another documentary

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:25.594 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And we were in Washington, DC.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.055 align:middle line:90%
And I had some free time.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.349 align:middle line:90%
And I wandered around the city.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:36.062 align:middle line:84%
And I was absolutely astounded
at the number of goddess

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.732 align:middle line:90%
statues that adorned the city.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.276 align:middle line:84%
Now on the one hand, that
might be just due to the fact

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:45.614 align:middle line:84%
that neoclassicism was
very popular at the time.

00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:50.327 align:middle line:84%
And goddesses appear a lot
on neoclassical statues.

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:53.079 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed to be
out of all proportion.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:58.251 align:middle line:84%
And so that, together
with the megalithic yard,

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:02.589 align:middle line:84%
caused us to look much more
carefully at Washington, DC,

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.633 align:middle line:84%
than we might
otherwise have done.

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:09.054 align:middle line:84%
It already had supposed
astronomical credentials.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.223 align:middle line:84%
And when I got
together with Janet,

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:16.227 align:middle line:84%
and we went back to Washington,
DC, and spent a lot of time

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.439 align:middle line:84%
with measuring rods and
looking and photographing,

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.359 align:middle line:84%
then we began to realize that
there was something extremely

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.235 align:middle line:90%
special about this city.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:28.281 align:middle line:84%
It is, on the one hand,
exactly what it appears to be.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:31.534 align:middle line:84%
It is the capital, of course,
of the United States of America,

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:35.872 align:middle line:84%
where the laws
are made and where

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.582 align:middle line:84%
your version of the
parliament sits.

00:07:38.582 --> 00:07:42.629 align:middle line:84%
And it does all of those
things administratively.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But beneath the surface, and not
very far beneath the surface,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.134 align:middle line:84%
is a city that was
designed primarily

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.803 align:middle line:90%
with a goddess in mind.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:52.305 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the geometrical
layout is feminine in nature,

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:56.851 align:middle line:84%
and that would mean that that
energetic imprint would show

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.019 align:middle line:90%
itself somewhere.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.146 align:middle line:84%
But you say much
of this information

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:03.733 align:middle line:84%
was flowing out from the
Eleusinian Mysteries dedicated

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.403 align:middle line:90%
to Demeter, and Ceres, and Isis.

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.154 align:middle line:84%
And Isis, of course,
comes back into play

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.657 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking about
Washington, DC, a little bit.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.617 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the
Eleusinian Mysteries.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.286 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: Well, the
Eleusinian Mysteries,

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
which were celebrated
in Eleusis--

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.082 align:middle line:84%
which is not far from
Athens in Greece--

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:23.753 align:middle line:84%
was probably the longest-running
religious ceremony,

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.089 align:middle line:84%
yearly ceremony, that
the world has ever known.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:30.218 align:middle line:84%
It lasted for over 1,000
years and probably much longer

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.553 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.346 align:middle line:84%
What used to happen
is that devotees

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:84%
from all over the known world
used to gather in Athens,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.102 align:middle line:84%
and they would spend a
couple of days in Athens.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.145 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
walk in ceremony

00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:44.524 align:middle line:84%
to this place, Eleusis, where
there was a huge temple which

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:48.027 align:middle line:84%
was dedicated to Demeter,
who was the Greek version

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:50.155 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth goddess.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:53.032 align:middle line:84%
She's often called the Goddess
of A Thousand Names justifiably

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:56.035 align:middle line:84%
because she has so
many personifications.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:58.705 align:middle line:84%
But Demeter was
their version of it.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:04.919 align:middle line:84%
Now at the Demeter celebrations,
men and women, free people

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:09.466 align:middle line:84%
and slaves, all took
part in a mystery rite.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It's called a mystery rite
because nobody ever spoke

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:90%
about it, on pain of death.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.056 align:middle line:84%
We know that it took
all night for them

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:19.392 align:middle line:84%
to go through this
elaborate ceremony

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.853 align:middle line:84%
inside this huge
temple, but we don't

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.062 align:middle line:90%
know exactly what happened.

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:27.233 align:middle line:84%
Though it seems almost
certainly to be the case

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:33.531 align:middle line:84%
that they ritually died and were
reborn during this ceremony,

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
into the rights and into
the privileges of Demeter.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.845 align:middle line:84%
And undoubtedly, it
involved the same process

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:44.125 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
a few minutes ago,

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:48.921 align:middle line:84%
the communion of the sky
and the Earth-- the god

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.452 align:middle line:84%
and the goddess-- the
birth of the young god who

00:09:52.452 --> 00:09:54.644 align:middle line:84%
is represented by
the cereal grain,

00:09:54.644 --> 00:09:57.722 align:middle line:84%
and then the death
of the young god

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:01.017 align:middle line:84%
when the cereal
grain was cut down.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.102 align:middle line:90%
And this was a yearly ceremony.

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:06.606 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it took
place in September.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.817 align:middle line:84%
And that was important
because that was the time when

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:11.027 align:middle line:90%
the grain was being harvested.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:16.741 align:middle line:84%
So it really celebrated
death and rebirth.

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:20.286 align:middle line:84%
And it was crucially
important because it

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:23.623 align:middle line:84%
was part of a religious
practice which

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:29.045 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have been all across
Europe, and well into Asia.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:33.258 align:middle line:84%
Wherever we find remnants
of ancient religion,

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.927 align:middle line:90%
we find this sort of thing.

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.096 align:middle line:84%
And even by the time
it was being celebrated

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.223 align:middle line:84%
as the Mysteries of
Demeter in Athens,

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:43.643 align:middle line:84%
it was already extremely
old and had already existed

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.603 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:50.441 align:middle line:84%
Now, we find statues of Demeter,
and of her Roman counterpart

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:53.736 align:middle line:84%
who is called Ceres,
more in Washington, DC,

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:57.615 align:middle line:84%
than any other named
goddess statue.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.076 align:middle line:84%
And because of the orientation
of the buildings, things

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:04.247 align:middle line:84%
that we'll talk about
in a little while, then

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:07.125 align:middle line:84%
we know that there
is a connection.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.002 align:middle line:84%
But we know for another
important reason

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.211 align:middle line:90%
that there's a connection.

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:16.593 align:middle line:84%
That is because when it came
to the founding fathers passing

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:84%
a new constitution--
because of course,

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.722 align:middle line:84%
a free United States
couldn't really

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:24.183 align:middle line:84%
be a nation until it
had a constitution.

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.436 align:middle line:84%
When they did that, they
did it in Pennsylvania

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.229 align:middle line:90%
in the 18th century.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:31.024 align:middle line:90%
They met for months and months.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.693 align:middle line:84%
They met for so long that
everybody was saying,

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.361 align:middle line:90%
why can't we go home?

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.697 align:middle line:84%
We seem to have-- >> REGINA:
Took a very long time.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.365 align:middle line:84%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
>> BUTLER: But, no.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.199 align:middle line:90%
They kept the land.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:42.577 align:middle line:84%
They kept the land
until September.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.746 align:middle line:84%
And Constitution
Day just happens

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to be exactly the
same day in the year

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.002 align:middle line:84%
when the Eleusinian
Mysteries used to take place.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:54.797 align:middle line:84%
And that is recorded,
physically, in Washington DC,

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:56.758 align:middle line:84%
again, something we'll
go on to talk about.

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.425 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:58.384 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.511 align:middle line:84%
And from the little bit I
know about the mysteries,

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
those mysteries, when
they were looking at life

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.352 align:middle line:84%
beyond this life, it was a
very idealized, very plentiful,

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.437 align:middle line:84%
very ordered toward
the Earth, the beauty,

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and the bounty of the Earth, and
the feminine presence on Earth.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.734 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.153 align:middle line:84%
I think as far as we know,
within the ceremonies

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.874 align:middle line:84%
themselves, the
aspirants-- the people who

00:12:19.874 --> 00:12:23.813 align:middle line:84%
took part-- were first of
all taken to a place which

00:12:23.813 --> 00:12:25.161 align:middle line:90%
we would call Hell.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.413 align:middle line:90%
It was awful.

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:31.292 align:middle line:84%
And to get a great
contrast, then as you say,

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:34.295 align:middle line:84%
they were taken to what was
known as the Elysian Fields,

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.255 align:middle line:90%
where everything was beautiful.

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:37.291 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Perfect.

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:38.091 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:41.511 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: And I think they were
being taught that not only was

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.347 align:middle line:84%
that what could be
expected after death,

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:47.009 align:middle line:84%
but also they were being taught
that that was the way the world

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:47.809 align:middle line:90%
should be.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:50.687 align:middle line:84%
So it was idealism
for the present life

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:51.854 align:middle line:90%
as well as any future life.

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:52.939 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I happen
to agree with that vision.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.024 align:middle line:84%
Why can't it be that lovely
and plentiful, right?

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:55.893 align:middle line:90%
And peaceful.

00:12:55.893 --> 00:12:56.693 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.861 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into
the Venus Family,

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.405 align:middle line:90%
as you coined that term.

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:01.948 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk-- give
a little background

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
as to why you call these
particular families the Venus

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.496 align:middle line:84%
Families, and
individuals as well.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.707 align:middle line:90%
And how?

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.084 align:middle line:90%
What the evidence for that was.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:15.378 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: We had to
give these people a name.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:18.339 align:middle line:84%
We knew that they existed
in the background.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:23.094 align:middle line:84%
Right from Stone Age times,
right through early history--

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.304 align:middle line:84%
the Dark Ages, the
Medieval Period--

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:27.306 align:middle line:90%
we have lots of evidence.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:30.727 align:middle line:84%
Their appearance
within society I

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:33.521 align:middle line:84%
coined as being
like a golden thread

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.565 align:middle line:90%
through the tapestry of time.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:38.276 align:middle line:84%
They just appeared in different
guises all over the place.

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:41.112 align:middle line:84%
And we knew it was
them because of the way

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:45.658 align:middle line:84%
they measured things, because
of their reverence for the sky,

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:50.163 align:middle line:84%
because they turned existing
religions into vehicles

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.623 align:middle line:90%
that they could use.

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:55.334 align:middle line:84%
And for all sorts of reasons,
we knew they were there.

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:58.004 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
that they all betrayed

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:01.507 align:middle line:84%
was a particular reverence
for the planet Venus.

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, it isn't just the Earth
that represents the goddess.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:04.927 align:middle line:90%
Venus does as well.

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:05.845 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Venus, yes.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.264 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: She still
has a female name.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:12.393 align:middle line:84%
And so Venus is
very, very important

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
for all sorts of reasons,
especially mathematical ones.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.025 align:middle line:84%
And we have to say that these
ancient beliefs not only

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:22.278 align:middle line:84%
encompassed what we
would call religion,

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:25.406 align:middle line:84%
but also what we
would call science.

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:28.409 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
was no differentiation

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:32.872 align:middle line:84%
between the knowledge of the
sky in terms of its movements,

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:38.211 align:middle line:84%
mathematically, and in terms of
its meanings, astrologically.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:41.547 align:middle line:90%
Everything was bunched together.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:45.635 align:middle line:84%
And Venus has a very special
relationship with the Earth

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:46.844 align:middle line:90%
mathematically.

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:51.057 align:middle line:84%
For every eight
Earth years, Venus

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:55.228 align:middle line:84%
goes through five complete
cycles, as seen from the Earth.

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:58.439 align:middle line:84%
And this 8 to 5
relationship throws up

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.983 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of
mathematical certainties

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:03.945 align:middle line:84%
which the ancient people seem
to have known instinctively.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:07.031 align:middle line:84%
It's enabled them to
predict other happenings,

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
because it ties in with
other cycles as well.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.955 align:middle line:84%
So it even has an association
with the cycles of the moon.

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:18.084 align:middle line:84%
Also, Venus is, indisputably,
probably the most beautiful

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:23.089 align:middle line:84%
object in the sky, apart from,
arguably, the Sun and the Moon.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.841 align:middle line:84%
And it changes from
being a morning

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.093 align:middle line:90%
star to being an evening star.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.303 align:middle line:84%
That in itself was
a kind of clock.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:32.223 align:middle line:84%
Well, we find out that
are groups of people--

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.308 align:middle line:90%
always venerated Venus.

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:37.228 align:middle line:84%
And it was such
a important thing

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:40.106 align:middle line:84%
that connected them that we
thought that was a good name

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.149 align:middle line:90%
to give to them.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:44.235 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea what these
people call themselves.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Interesting, because
I've done a couple of very

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:90%
esoteric interviews.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.325 align:middle line:84%
And one of them had
to do with the life

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.369 align:middle line:90%
and times of George Adamski.

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And Adamski was a gentleman
who challenged others

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.835 align:middle line:84%
to please listen to
his story, tear it

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.962 align:middle line:90%
apart, make him wrong on it.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
He was really quite an
intelligent, beautiful

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.049 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:10.136 align:middle line:84%
But in his day, he was saying he
had met with beings from Venus,

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.681 align:middle line:84%
And that he had been taken
into their environment

00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:15.474 align:middle line:84%
and shown what they
know and so forth.

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, it shows itself
like the Eleusinian fields--

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:26.319 align:middle line:84%
just a more perfected, peaceful,
abundant, beautiful version

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.153 align:middle line:90%
of Earth life.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:30.323 align:middle line:84%
Now, that same story and
those same characters

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.241 align:middle line:84%
got passed through,
through Paula Harris'

00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:84%
work and the valiant Thor story,
which is fascinating in itself.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.167 align:middle line:84%
And again, they
claim to be Venusians

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.711 align:middle line:84%
in that they were trying to
share some of the healing

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:47.173 align:middle line:84%
principles from Venus
with the people here.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that was
in Adamski's work in particular

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.806 align:middle line:84%
was a greater understanding of
anti-gravity but also geometry,

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:57.558 align:middle line:90%
the way they understood it.

00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:00.353 align:middle line:84%
And I found that part of
the work really fascinating,

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.730 align:middle line:84%
because it was far beyond
what we understand right now.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.318 align:middle line:84%
I'm just tossing that in because
our viewers may have already

00:17:05.318 --> 00:17:07.568 align:middle line:84%
seen those interviews or may
want to be guided there--

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:10.154 align:middle line:84%
for a notion of
what, in these times,

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.156 align:middle line:84%
some of the esoteric
thinking has

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:14.994 align:middle line:84%
to say about the occupants
of Venus, whatever

00:17:14.994 --> 00:17:16.035 align:middle line:90%
dimension that may be in.

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.704 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: It's very
strange that there are those

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:21.082 align:middle line:90%
connections.

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:24.542 align:middle line:84%
We try always, wherever
possible with our work,

00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:28.130 align:middle line:84%
to stick to what is
scientifically provable.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's your arena.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.918 align:middle line:84%
And I'm tossing
the other part in.

00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:32.718 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: No.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.137 align:middle line:84%
But that's very
valid, because when

00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:39.647 align:middle line:84%
you find the esoteric meets the
practical-- >> REGINA: Well,

00:17:39.647 --> 00:17:40.601 align:middle line:90%
that's what I like.

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.855 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: --then you're
probably on to something.

00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:43.771 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think so.

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And you say, these families had
a great interest in astronomy.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.941 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Mhm.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:47.483 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:49.151 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So again-- >>
BUTLER: And astrology.

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:50.236 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And astrology.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:53.239 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that a little bit.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.658 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: I think the
fundamental interest

00:17:55.658 --> 00:18:00.413 align:middle line:84%
in astronomy originated
right back at the start,

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:04.625 align:middle line:84%
probably as long ago as 3,000
BC-- and for several reasons.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:07.753 align:middle line:90%
There were practical reasons.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.547 align:middle line:84%
We call these people
megalithic people.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:10.923 align:middle line:90%
Megalithic means big stone.

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:13.676 align:middle line:84%
They moved big stones
around the landscape.

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
that they needed to do

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.264 align:middle line:90%
was to travel and to trade.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:22.435 align:middle line:84%
But Great Britain is not a very
good island for getting about.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.437 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly
wasn't in those days,

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.897 align:middle line:84%
because it would have been
very marshy in the lowlands

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:29.275 align:middle line:90%
and inhospitable in the uplands.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:32.528 align:middle line:84%
The only real option they had
for getting about was by water.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:34.447 align:middle line:84%
So they traveled a
lot around the coast,

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.991 align:middle line:84%
and they traveled a
lot on the rivers.

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:40.286 align:middle line:84%
But particularly, they used
a lot of coastal travel.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.997 align:middle line:84%
And one of the epicenters
of megalithic culture

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:46.208 align:middle line:84%
was in Scotland, which is even
more inhospitable, weather

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:47.752 align:middle line:90%
wise, than England is.

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.129 align:middle line:84%
So the one thing that they
needed more than anything else

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.214 align:middle line:90%
was to understand the tides.

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And the tides are affected
greatly-- in fact,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.138 align:middle line:84%
almost exclusively--
by the Moon.

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.014 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:02.433 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: So if you know what
the Moon's phases are going

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.602 align:middle line:84%
to be and what the Moon is
going to be doing next--

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:08.397 align:middle line:84%
how high it is in the
sky this month, how low--

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:13.019 align:middle line:84%
then you have a very good idea
of how high the tides are going

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:13.819 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:16.697 align:middle line:84%
And that together with your
required, local knowledge

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:19.367 align:middle line:84%
allows you to travel
safely at a time

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:84%
when the craft that
they were using

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.704 align:middle line:90%
were not particularly advanced.

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:26.208 align:middle line:84%
So it meant they could get
about-- so practical knowledge.

00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:27.666 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Every
farmer's almanac--

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:29.293 align:middle line:84%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
>> BUTLER: Absolutely.

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.093 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:30.093 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
They similarly needed to
know about the movements

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.759 align:middle line:84%
and position of the Sun
throughout the Earth,

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:38.219 align:middle line:90%
because they were early farmers.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:43.307 align:middle line:84%
They needed to know when to
plant and when to harvest.

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:47.853 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things were
very much tied up with the sky.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.231 align:middle line:84%
If they were doing
longer-distance travel,

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.817 align:middle line:84%
they would need to understand
the other planets and the stars

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:56.695 align:middle line:84%
as well, because that would
give them a good idea as to what

00:19:56.695 --> 00:20:00.157 align:middle line:84%
latitude they were at, for
example, when they were out

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:01.909 align:middle line:90%
of sight of land.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:03.577 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
things came together

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:06.247 align:middle line:84%
to make it really
important for them.

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:08.958 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, they clearly

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:13.045 align:middle line:90%
equated the sky with the Earth.

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:15.714 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have
thought that the sky was

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.758 align:middle line:90%
the Earth turned inside out.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.511 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
happened on the Earth

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:23.556 align:middle line:90%
had a celestial counterpart.

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:27.059 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come eventually
to talk about Orion's Belt.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:31.021 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of one of
the constellations which

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.982 align:middle line:90%
were really important to them.

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:36.193 align:middle line:84%
They thought that the Earth
could be connected literally

00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:37.736 align:middle line:90%
with the stars.

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:42.408 align:middle line:84%
And so everything that they
did had, on the one hand,

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
a very practical aspect to
it, and also a very esoteric

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.663 align:middle line:90%
and religious aspect as well.

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:50.291 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when we get into
some of the cast of characters,

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.042 align:middle line:84%
we'll understand this
a little bit better.

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:55.045 align:middle line:84%
But you say that, oftentimes,
these Venus families

00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:56.414 align:middle line:90%
work through the Freemasonry.

00:20:56.414 --> 00:20:57.214 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:59.008 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's bring
that into the story.

00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:00.759 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: OK.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:04.555 align:middle line:84%
We need to just talk about
those people we refer to

00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:06.432 align:middle line:90%
as the Venus families.

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:09.768 align:middle line:84%
They are the central
core of all of this.

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:14.106 align:middle line:84%
And organizations like
Freemasons, like Rosicrucians,

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:17.526 align:middle line:84%
like the Grange organization
in America, they are,

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
if you like, the foot soldiers
of the Venus families.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.951 align:middle line:84%
So the Venus families run
the show behind the scenes,

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:29.205 align:middle line:84%
but they express
themselves in society

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.623 align:middle line:90%
through other organizations.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.125 align:middle line:84%
And the Freemasons
is one of them.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:39.048 align:middle line:84%
The origin of the Freemasons is
really absolutely fascinating.

00:21:39.048 --> 00:21:43.302 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows, in a
true historical sense,

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:45.304 align:middle line:90%
where Freemasonry came from.

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:50.976 align:middle line:84%
But you can trace the lineage,
which is utterly fascinating.

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:54.563 align:middle line:84%
They go back to medieval
times-- >> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:56.982 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: --in particular
to the building of the great

00:21:56.982 --> 00:22:02.238 align:middle line:84%
Gothic cathedrals and
to a group of people--

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:05.658 align:middle line:84%
which was a kind of Guild
of Stonemasons in France--

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.284 align:middle line:90%
called the Children of Solomon.

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:09.662 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Wouldn't those
have been also passed on from

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:10.787 align:middle line:90%
the Knight Templar lineage?

00:22:10.787 --> 00:22:11.586 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:13.712 align:middle line:84%
The Knights Templar-- >>
REGINA: And the Cistercian

00:22:13.712 --> 00:22:14.917 align:middle line:90%
monks and so forth.

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:18.087 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: This organization,
the Children of Solomon,

00:22:18.087 --> 00:22:22.466 align:middle line:84%
was so closely associated with
the Knights Templar that it

00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:25.135 align:middle line:84%
probably was an offshoot
of the same order.

00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:29.223 align:middle line:84%
But when the Knights Templar
was destroyed in 1307,

00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:32.685 align:middle line:84%
the Children of Solomon
Guild went underground.

00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:33.519 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.187 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the Templar's
that weren't signed,

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:35.521 align:middle line:90%
went underground.

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.522 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: That's right.

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:38.566 align:middle line:90%
And it never ceased to exist.

00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:42.194 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, a group of
these Children of Solomon,

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:44.477 align:middle line:84%
had gone to a place
on the West Coast

00:22:44.477 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
of Scotland called
Kilwinning, where

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.243 align:middle line:90%
a new abbey was being built.

00:22:49.243 --> 00:22:51.203 align:middle line:84%
And they were
peripatetic, these people.

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:53.789 align:middle line:84%
They traveled all over
Europe, taking their skills

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:55.624 align:middle line:90%
where they were needed.

00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:57.876 align:middle line:84%
But instead of
leaving Kilwinning

00:22:57.876 --> 00:23:02.423 align:middle line:84%
after the abbey was completed,
they stayed in the town.

00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:08.387 align:middle line:84%
And they kept on existing as
a brotherhood, in Kilwinning.

00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:11.724 align:middle line:84%
Even right through the
Reformation of the church

00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:15.436 align:middle line:84%
and into Protestantism,
they were still there.

00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:20.608 align:middle line:84%
And coinciding with what they
call the great Enlightenment,

00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:24.903 align:middle line:84%
when superstition was starting
to turn into science and people

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
were meeting in the
coffee houses of Edinburgh

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.161 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, then
the organization

00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:35.456 align:middle line:84%
which had been formed in
Kilwinning came to Edinburgh.

00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:38.001 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be
where Freemasonry-- >>

00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:39.209 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Scottish Freemasonry.

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:41.712 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Mhm.

00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:46.383 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This vision
they had of the new world,

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:48.637 align:middle line:84%
with a Masonic
participation in this--

00:23:48.637 --> 00:23:50.262 align:middle line:84%
you have very high
levels of knowledge.

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:52.264 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
practical, everyday person

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:54.435 align:middle line:84%
that joins for political
or social reasons.

00:23:54.435 --> 00:23:55.601 align:middle line:90%
And you can use it for good.

00:23:55.601 --> 00:23:56.935 align:middle line:84%
You can use it for
something else.

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:59.143 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: And do you know
the amazing thing, Regina,

00:23:59.143 --> 00:24:02.024 align:middle line:84%
about Freemasonry is every
piece of information,

00:24:02.024 --> 00:24:06.487 align:middle line:84%
the most esoteric of
information, is accessible,

00:24:06.487 --> 00:24:10.407 align:middle line:84%
or it's there, for
anyone who wants to look.

00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:13.247 align:middle line:84%
But it's a bit like--
let me give you

00:24:13.247 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:84%
an example here in London,
where we are at the moment.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.958 align:middle line:84%
We have a nursery rhyme
that children learn

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:22.044 align:middle line:90%
called "Oranges and Lemons."

00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:25.673 align:middle line:84%
And it has a tune that goes
with it, and it starts out,

00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:28.634 align:middle line:84%
Oranges and Lemons says
the bells of St. Clemens.

00:24:28.634 --> 00:24:31.011 align:middle line:84%
I owe you five farthings said
the bells of St. Martin's.

00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:32.846 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on like that.

00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:35.724 align:middle line:84%
Now, that little
nursery rhyme actually

00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:38.811 align:middle line:84%
recalls the sounds
of the peals of bells

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:41.313 align:middle line:90%
in the churches in London.

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:46.694 align:middle line:84%
But it gave us that information
about the churches before 1666,

00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:49.822 align:middle line:84%
when there was a great fire
here in London which destroyed

00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:51.615 align:middle line:90%
every one of the churches.

00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So subsequently, the bells
never sounded like that again,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.164 align:middle line:84%
because new peals of bells
were put in the new churches.

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:03.877 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who learns that
nursery rhyme and sings it

00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:06.922 align:middle line:84%
is party to information which
is several hundred years old,

00:25:06.922 --> 00:25:08.374 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
know that they are.

00:25:08.374 --> 00:25:09.174 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:11.343 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: And that's the
same with Freemasonry.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.387 align:middle line:84%
All the secrets are
there, but you must

00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:15.931 align:middle line:90%
have the key to unlock them.

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:17.933 align:middle line:84%
And little by little,
Freemasons are

00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:21.979 align:middle line:84%
given more and more of the
key that allows them to unlock

00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:23.021 align:middle line:90%
what's really going on.

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:23.856 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And, yes.

00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:24.656 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:27.359 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's cross the Freemasons
over with the Grange.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.736 align:middle line:90%
Introduce the Grange.

00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:32.156 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: The Grange is
an amazing organization.

00:25:32.156 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Not long after the
American Civil War,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:41.039 align:middle line:84%
the South in particular was in
a terrible state, obviously.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:43.459 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the farmers,
small farmers,

00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:48.088 align:middle line:84%
down there had either been
killed or injured in the war.

00:25:48.088 --> 00:25:51.884 align:middle line:84%
And trade had
virtually disappeared.

00:25:51.884 --> 00:25:55.053 align:middle line:84%
And the people in Washington
were doing their very best

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:59.516 align:middle line:84%
to try and rebuild the
infrastructure of the South.

00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:03.687 align:middle line:84%
And they persuaded a man
called Oliver Kelly to go down

00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:06.231 align:middle line:84%
into the South and
to talk to people

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:07.733 align:middle line:90%
and see what could be done.

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:10.486 align:middle line:84%
Now, Oliver Kelly
was a Freemason.

00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So he got his thinking
cap on, and he thought,

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.325 align:middle line:84%
Southerners won't
talk to Northerners.

00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:18.327 align:middle line:84%
You can understand
just after a Civil War

00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:20.621 align:middle line:90%
why that would be the case.

00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:22.247 align:middle line:84%
So he went and
talked to Freemasons.

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:25.334 align:middle line:84%
And they would talk to him,
because they were Freemasons.

00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, with a
committee of other people--

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.716 align:middle line:84%
not just men-- he managed to
build a new organization which

00:26:32.716 --> 00:26:39.097 align:middle line:84%
was like a trade guild in a way
for farmers, for small farmers.

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.766 align:middle line:90%
It gave them a political voice.

00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:43.185 align:middle line:84%
It taught them how
to do certain things.

00:26:43.185 --> 00:26:46.313 align:middle line:84%
It introduced them
to new techniques.

00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:49.149 align:middle line:84%
And it fought against the
monopolies of the railways

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:51.026 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:52.945 align:middle line:90%
And he called it Grange.

00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:54.407 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA:
Egalitarian in nature.

00:26:54.407 --> 00:26:55.823 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: Absolutely
egalitarian.

00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:58.617 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which you liken
to the more of the feminine

00:26:58.617 --> 00:26:59.868 align:middle line:90%
principle.

00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:01.078 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Absolutely.

00:27:01.078 --> 00:27:04.456 align:middle line:84%
But that is because
of where it came from.

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:09.545 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I was in
Freemasonry, the feminine side

00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:13.841 align:middle line:84%
of Freemasonry has had to
be very carefully hidden

00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
over the years, for
all sorts of reasons.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.387 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't the case
with the Grange,

00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:21.348 align:middle line:84%
which was also based
on, more or less,

00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:23.767 align:middle line:90%
the same Freemasonic model.

00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:27.354 align:middle line:84%
But right from the start,
it was absolutely essential

00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:29.481 align:middle line:90%
that women were involved.

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It was essential from a
practical point of view,

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.987 align:middle line:84%
but it was essential
from the point of view

00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:39.157 align:middle line:84%
of building the America,
which slowly but surely,

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:43.287 align:middle line:84%
and gradually, the Venus
families wanted to build.

00:27:43.287 --> 00:27:46.918 align:middle line:84%
So the committee got
together, and they

00:27:46.918 --> 00:27:49.334 align:middle line:84%
decided that they were going
to have an organization which

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:53.255 align:middle line:84%
was based on degrees, the
same as Freemasonry is.

00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:57.009 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the Grange, there
were going to be seven degrees.

00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:59.887 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these
degrees was ruled over

00:27:59.887 --> 00:28:04.516 align:middle line:84%
by an actress who
took the name of one

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.476 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient goddesses.

00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:12.566 align:middle line:84%
So there was Flora and
Pomona and Demeter and Ceres.

00:28:12.566 --> 00:28:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And you gradually,
little by little,

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.154 align:middle line:90%
worked your way up the ladder.

00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:21.617 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of the organization
was done by women,

00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:23.827 align:middle line:84%
because of course, women
are much better organizers.

00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:26.455 align:middle line:84%
But this was one of
the first organizations

00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:29.458 align:middle line:84%
in the free world that seemed
to recognize that fact.

00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:31.919 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it's still
populated by a lot of men.

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:33.879 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: Yes, men
were in it as well.

00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But there were
quite strict rules.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.761 align:middle line:84%
For example, nobody was allowed
to drink at the meetings.

00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:43.597 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was allowed to
swear at the meetings.

00:28:43.597 --> 00:28:51.813 align:middle line:84%
So although it was diverse, and
although it was joint families

00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:53.690 align:middle line:84%
especially-- and
young people were

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.986 align:middle line:84%
encouraged to take part
as well-- underneath it

00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.113 align:middle line:90%
all was Freemasonry.

00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:03.909 align:middle line:84%
And the strange thing is that at
the time, although Freemasonry

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:08.246 align:middle line:84%
was being given a terrible time
in places like Washington DC,

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:10.916 align:middle line:84%
nobody seems to
have said anything

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:13.752 align:middle line:90%
about that aspect of the Grange.

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:17.199 align:middle line:84%
Now the Grange-- >> REGINA:
Because their function

00:29:17.199 --> 00:29:18.757 align:middle line:90%
was useful in society.

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:19.591 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: True.

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:20.425 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:20.592 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:21.426 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.804 align:middle line:84%
It could be argued that
the function of Freemasonry

00:29:23.804 --> 00:29:29.184 align:middle line:84%
is much more useful
than people realize.

00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:32.854 align:middle line:84%
I must throw my hat in the
ring, I am not a Freemason.

00:29:32.854 --> 00:29:36.608 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that they do
a tremendous amount of good

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.019 align:middle line:90%
and never talk about it.

00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:38.819 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:29:38.819 --> 00:29:41.272 align:middle line:84%
That is true, based on
ancient, ancient principles.

00:29:41.272 --> 00:29:42.072 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:45.526 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But again, from their
inheritance from the Knight

00:29:45.526 --> 00:29:46.326 align:middle line:90%
Templar.

00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:49.913 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
the Knight Templar

00:29:49.913 --> 00:29:55.335 align:middle line:84%
were able to recruit a lot of
renegades, rapists, pillagers.

00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:57.462 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
people that were really

00:29:57.462 --> 00:29:59.464 align:middle line:84%
brutal in the Knight
Templar campaigns.

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:02.259 align:middle line:84%
The crusader in the time
of the Crusades as well.

00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:04.594 align:middle line:84%
But the real
inheritance at the top

00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:07.514 align:middle line:84%
was much purer, cleaner,
and more noble than that.

00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: And they turned a
lot of the bad ones around.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:10.684 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They did.

00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:12.394 align:middle line:84%
And they did do that,
because otherwise,

00:30:12.394 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:84%
you said hungry people that
needed align with something.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.315 align:middle line:84%
So they get,
basically, a paycheck.

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:90%
According them some food.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.028 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: They took so much
violence off the streets

00:30:21.028 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:84%
of Western Europe in
the feudal period.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.156 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ultimately.

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:24.489 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:25.574 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:25.574 --> 00:30:28.118 align:middle line:84%
So now-- when we're
looking at the development

00:30:28.118 --> 00:30:30.829 align:middle line:84%
of the new world, with these
new principles and such,

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:34.541 align:middle line:84%
we can't avoid Francis Bacon
in the New Atlantis, right?

00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:36.251 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Mhm.

00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:42.591 align:middle line:84%
Francis Bacon may have been a
very early, proto-Freemason.

00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:46.219 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to say,
because even if Freemasonry

00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:50.474 align:middle line:84%
had existed at that time, it
must have been underground.

00:30:50.474 --> 00:30:53.602 align:middle line:84%
Because of the political
and religious turmoil

00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:55.979 align:middle line:84%
that was going on in
Britain at that time,

00:30:55.979 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:84%
nobody could have admitted
to Freemasonic membership.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.943 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: So he may
have been a Freemason.

00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:04.863 align:middle line:84%
But he certainly was
associated with these people

00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:07.032 align:middle line:90%
we call the Venus families.

00:31:07.032 --> 00:31:10.452 align:middle line:84%
Almost everything that he did
and everything that he said

00:31:10.452 --> 00:31:15.832 align:middle line:84%
betrays the fact that he
had revolutionary ideas.

00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:19.044 align:middle line:84%
He was absolutely committed
to this concept of the New

00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem, which is what
everything we are talking about

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.508 align:middle line:84%
is really about at
the end of the day.

00:31:24.508 --> 00:31:27.586 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he wrote the
book about the New Jerusalem.

00:31:27.586 --> 00:31:28.386 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And talk about what that vision
was so people understand it.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.726 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: He could get away
with it to a certain extent

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:84%
because it was, ostensibly,
the Jerusalem that's mentioned

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:43.610 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible in the
Book of Revelation.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:46.988 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand,
nobody could take umbrage

00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:50.450 align:middle line:84%
with what he was saying, because
he was fulfilling gospels.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:54.746 align:middle line:84%
And you could say
that his idealized New

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:57.999 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem was really
just a version

00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.418 align:middle line:90%
of the Book of Revelation.

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:03.588 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
what he was talking about

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:84%
was religious and
political freedom.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.973 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that Francis
Bacon was right on the leading

00:32:12.973 --> 00:32:15.767 align:middle line:90%
edge of feminine equality.

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:19.271 align:middle line:84%
But that would have been very
surprising back in Tudor times.

00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:23.483 align:middle line:84%
But we know that he treated
the women in his own sphere

00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:25.986 align:middle line:90%
extremely well.

00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:28.488 align:middle line:84%
He knew that women had to
be educated and so forth.

00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:33.243 align:middle line:84%
So probably within the remit
of the society he lived in,

00:32:33.243 --> 00:32:34.870 align:middle line:90%
he was going in that direction.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.329 align:middle line:84%
But what he really
wanted more than

00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:43.128 align:middle line:84%
anything else was a new start,
a start where dogmatism was out

00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:44.129 align:middle line:90%
of the window.

00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:46.165 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The chains
of the past, in general.

00:32:46.165 --> 00:32:46.965 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Exactly.

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:51.928 align:middle line:84%
Now, this had been tried
all across Western Europe,

00:32:51.928 --> 00:32:54.389 align:middle line:90%
right back into medieval times.

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:57.142 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Venus families,
and those people associated

00:32:57.142 --> 00:33:00.145 align:middle line:84%
with them, had by
the time of Bacon

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:03.398 align:middle line:84%
given up all hope that
anywhere in Western Europe

00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:05.567 align:middle line:84%
could become this
place that they

00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:08.153 align:middle line:90%
wanted to be the New Jerusalem.

00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:09.988 align:middle line:90%
Bacon wrote about it.

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:13.617 align:middle line:84%
He talked about a
fictitious island

00:33:13.617 --> 00:33:15.285 align:middle line:84%
and talked about the
people who lived--

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:19.331 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of life that they
led, the freedom that they had.

00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:21.166 align:middle line:90%
It was fictitious.

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:28.381 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, much of
it sounds very much like even

00:33:28.381 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:90%
he envisaged America would be.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.548 align:middle line:84%
Almost like planting some
sort of seed-- vision.

00:33:35.548 --> 00:33:36.348 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:33:36.348 --> 00:33:38.975 align:middle line:84%
And he could get away with
it as well because it wasn't

00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:40.769 align:middle line:90%
published until after he died.

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:42.721 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And also,
as you say, as fiction.

00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:43.521 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:45.398 align:middle line:90%
And it was fiction.

00:33:45.398 --> 00:33:50.111 align:middle line:90%
He had great beliefs in America.

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:54.115 align:middle line:84%
He had a lot to do with the
development of Virginia.

00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:57.035 align:middle line:84%
He personally sponsored
all sorts of expeditions

00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:90%
to Virginia.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.288 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people who believe

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:03.166 align:middle line:90%
that he went there himself.

00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:06.211 align:middle line:84%
Whilst I wouldn't say that
I believe that absolutely,

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:08.838 align:middle line:84%
because there is
no absolute proof,

00:34:08.838 --> 00:34:12.384 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be unduly
surprised if he had been.

00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:15.679 align:middle line:84%
But whether he did or
not, he had a great deal

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.136 align:middle line:84%
to say about what
America should be,

00:34:18.136 --> 00:34:22.039 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of it in the book
about New Jerusalem-- which,

00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:24.354 align:middle line:84%
as I say, wasn't published
until after his death,

00:34:24.354 --> 00:34:26.690 align:middle line:84%
so nobody could take
him out and burn him.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.984 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's talk
about some of these players

00:34:28.984 --> 00:34:30.193 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:32.132 align:middle line:84%
First we come to
George Washington,

00:34:32.132 --> 00:34:33.697 align:middle line:90%
a well-known-- >> BUTLER: Yes.

00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:35.572 align:middle line:84%
Washington was--
>> REGINA: --Mason.

00:34:35.572 --> 00:34:37.117 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: --extremely
well-educated,

00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:42.414 align:middle line:90%
and a very avid Freemason.

00:34:42.414 --> 00:34:44.873 align:middle line:84%
But he was also what a lot
of the rest of them were.

00:34:44.873 --> 00:34:46.501 align:middle line:90%
He was a deist.

00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, a deist is someone who
believes in a supreme deity,

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:84%
but who chooses for
their own reasons

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:58.054 align:middle line:84%
not to specify
what that diety is.

00:34:58.054 --> 00:35:01.224 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that George
Washington, together

00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:04.060 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of the
other founding fathers,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.854 align:middle line:90%
were not simply deists.

00:35:05.854 --> 00:35:09.357 align:middle line:84%
They were members of,
or associated with,

00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:10.984 align:middle line:90%
the Venus family.

00:35:10.984 --> 00:35:12.902 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember that
George Washington had

00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:17.991 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of input into
the design of Washington DC.

00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:20.452 align:middle line:84%
Most of what we have said,
and I'm going to say,

00:35:20.452 --> 00:35:22.829 align:middle line:84%
about Washington,
DC, couldn't have

00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:84%
happened unless the blueprint
was right in the first place.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.543 align:middle line:84%
It had to be astronomically
correct for it

00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:29.794 align:middle line:90%
to do all the things it does.

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.671 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, it
does a lot of things.

00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:34.132 align:middle line:84%
And George Washington
was in on that.

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So he must have had the same
aspirations as the Venus

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.680 align:middle line:90%
families.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.806 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When he
was the high degree,

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:43.975 align:middle line:84%
the highest degree Mason--
wasn't he-- of the day.

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:44.934 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Of the day.

00:35:44.934 --> 00:35:45.643 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of the day.

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:46.478 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:48.889 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't quite the
height of measurement then.

00:35:48.889 --> 00:35:49.689 align:middle line:90%
But, yes.

00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:52.059 align:middle line:84%
He was as high as he
could get at the time.

00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:52.859 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:53.651 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:54.451 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:56.814 align:middle line:84%
Another esteemed American--
Thomas Jefferson.

00:35:56.814 --> 00:35:57.614 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: My hero.

00:35:57.614 --> 00:35:58.281 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Me too.

00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:59.081 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:35:59.081 --> 00:36:02.326 align:middle line:84%
I was obsessed reading
one biogra-- in my 20s,

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:04.328 align:middle line:84%
I was obsessed with
him, as though I

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:90%
was in love with this person.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.124 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get
enough biographies.

00:36:08.124 --> 00:36:11.086 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: An absolute polymath,
a man that was interested

00:36:11.086 --> 00:36:12.629 align:middle line:90%
in everything.

00:36:12.629 --> 00:36:14.498 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So worth
going to Monticello.

00:36:14.498 --> 00:36:15.298 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:18.209 align:middle line:84%
As far as we are
aware-- well certainly,

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:20.345 align:middle line:84%
we can't prove that
he was a Freemason.

00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:23.306 align:middle line:84%
But I have friends
and associates

00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:25.850 align:middle line:84%
who think we're getting very
close to proving that when

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:29.854 align:middle line:84%
he was ambassador for America in
France, that he may have become

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:30.897 align:middle line:90%
a Freemason then.

00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:33.733 align:middle line:90%
He certainly behaved like one.

00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:38.279 align:middle line:84%
He was an even more avid deist
than was George Washington.

00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:41.199 align:middle line:84%
He made all sorts of
comments about Christianity.

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:43.201 align:middle line:90%
He detested Christianity.

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.245 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They did not
like organized religion,

00:36:45.245 --> 00:36:48.164 align:middle line:84%
even though they believed
in a great, creative being.

00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:48.998 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Absolute.

00:36:48.998 --> 00:36:49.374 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:49.374 --> 00:36:50.166 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:51.543 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And for
understandable reasons--

00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:53.044 align:middle line:84%
what was going on
politically at the time.

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.629 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: I think they
would have had a great deal

00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:57.215 align:middle line:84%
of sympathy, and probably did
have a great deal of sympathy,

00:36:57.215 --> 00:37:00.260 align:middle line:84%
with people like Quakers
who had their beliefs,

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.443 align:middle line:84%
but had them quietly-- who
didn't have massive rules

00:37:03.443 --> 00:37:05.807 align:middle line:84%
and regulations, didn't have--
>> REGINA: The dogmatism.

00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:06.975 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: --didn't have
Popes, didn't have bishops,

00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:07.976 align:middle line:90%
anything like that.

00:37:07.976 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
Jefferson particularly hated.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.691 align:middle line:84%
And he said on many
occasions, think

00:37:14.691 --> 00:37:17.402 align:middle line:84%
about how many people have
died, how many wars there have

00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:19.779 align:middle line:90%
been in the names of religion.

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:23.741 align:middle line:84%
And he was right from the start,
just as keen as Washington

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:25.452 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
other Founding Fathers

00:37:25.452 --> 00:37:30.331 align:middle line:84%
were, that America would not
be dedicated to one religion.

00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:33.251 align:middle line:84%
And despite the
fact that one could

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:38.840 align:middle line:84%
be forgiven for believing
that America is committed

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.135 align:middle line:84%
to Christianity, in a
constitutional sense,

00:37:42.135 --> 00:37:44.429 align:middle line:90%
this is not the case.

00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:48.766 align:middle line:84%
So they got what they
wanted, and it's still there.

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:51.269 align:middle line:84%
And anyone in America can lean
in any direction they want,

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.681 align:middle line:84%
but they can't lean the
state in that direction.

00:37:53.681 --> 00:37:54.481 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:55.281 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:55.281 --> 00:37:58.109 align:middle line:84%
And also, he was
very deeply involved

00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:01.237 align:middle line:84%
with the land and agriculture
and experimentation of crops.

00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:03.781 align:middle line:84%
So I bring this in going
back again to the Grange.

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:04.616 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:10.788 align:middle line:84%
Had he been alive by the time
the Civil War took place,

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:12.540 align:middle line:84%
he would have been
right up there,

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.626 align:middle line:84%
as far as the
Grange is concerned,

00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:16.169 align:middle line:90%
because he would have seen it.

00:38:16.169 --> 00:38:19.464 align:middle line:84%
Also, much more
than Washington--

00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:21.257 align:middle line:84%
and you'll know from
your own reading--

00:38:21.257 --> 00:38:23.968 align:middle line:84%
Jefferson was not
a person who wanted

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.429 align:middle line:90%
an over industrialized America.

00:38:26.429 --> 00:38:27.597 align:middle line:90%
He loved the land.

00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:30.099 align:middle line:90%
He loved agriculture.

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:31.768 align:middle line:84%
So he might have been
a bit disappointed

00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:34.812 align:middle line:84%
when the big centers
of industry developed.

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:36.814 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I have no doubt.

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.475 align:middle line:90%
I even have his estate cookbook.

00:38:38.475 --> 00:38:39.275 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yeah?

00:38:39.275 --> 00:38:41.854 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The things that
he and his cooks use to make

00:38:41.854 --> 00:38:42.654 align:middle line:90%
in the day.

00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:43.613 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:38:43.613 --> 00:38:46.616 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: Also, it's
worth mentioning--

00:38:46.616 --> 00:38:49.452 align:middle line:84%
somebody was asking me
the other day, well,

00:38:49.452 --> 00:38:52.247 align:middle line:84%
if you write about all of
this, why did both Washington

00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:55.291 align:middle line:90%
and Jefferson have slaves?

00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:58.711 align:middle line:84%
And I've looked into
this really carefully.

00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:02.006 align:middle line:84%
And I think the expression
"softly, softly,

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:05.510 align:middle line:84%
catchee monkey" comes
in here, because they

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.221 align:middle line:84%
lived in the society
that they lived in.

00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And they would've known that you
cannot change things overnight.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.021 align:middle line:84%
As it was, America ended
up fighting the Civil War

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:21.025 align:middle line:84%
because the South was unwilling
to get rid of its slaves.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:25.321 align:middle line:84%
And this is quite a few
decades before that.

00:39:25.321 --> 00:39:28.866 align:middle line:84%
And Jefferson and Washington
both said many times,

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:30.368 align:middle line:90%
we don't agree with slavery.

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:34.622 align:middle line:84%
But at the moment, we cannot
just stop it in its tracks,

00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:38.251 align:middle line:84%
or the country will
disintegrate around our ears.

00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:39.669 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
one thing that you

00:39:39.669 --> 00:39:43.047 align:middle line:84%
can say about the Venus family
is that they're very patient.

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:46.009 align:middle line:84%
They're very enduring--
that they recognize

00:39:46.009 --> 00:39:49.053 align:middle line:90%
that the world is not a utopia.

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:52.132 align:middle line:84%
But they want to move slowly
and steadily in that direction.

00:39:52.132 --> 00:39:52.932 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:52.932 --> 00:39:55.351 align:middle line:84%
And I think he certainly
contributed on many levels

00:39:55.351 --> 00:39:58.062 align:middle line:84%
and was a highly-conflicted
man as a result,

00:39:58.062 --> 00:39:59.939 align:middle line:84%
because of the
notion of slavery.

00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: He didn't
like it intellectually.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.108 align:middle line:90%
He didn't like it morally.

00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:03.192 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He did not.

00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:05.194 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: But he
lived in a real world.

00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:06.738 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Was in Virginia.

00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:07.648 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:40:07.648 --> 00:40:08.448 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:08.448 --> 00:40:09.782 align:middle line:90%
Thomas-- and not Thomas.

00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:10.734 align:middle line:90%
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

00:40:10.734 --> 00:40:11.534 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:12.535 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That surprised me.

00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:12.785 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:12.785 --> 00:40:14.621 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what that connection is.

00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:18.708 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: He's another
one of my absolute heroes.

00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt was a
33-degree Freemasonry.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.466 align:middle line:84%
The best way I can describe
the way he thought about things

00:40:26.466 --> 00:40:31.596 align:middle line:84%
is to tell you a story about
the upcoming Second World

00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:36.809 align:middle line:84%
War and the way that
Roosevelt went about dealing

00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:39.062 align:middle line:90%
with that situation.

00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:43.149 align:middle line:84%
There is a degree in Scottish
Rite Freemasonry which

00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:49.072 align:middle line:84%
deals with a man who is
left in a chapel overnight,

00:40:49.072 --> 00:40:51.741 align:middle line:84%
ahead of him receiving
a knighthood.

00:40:51.741 --> 00:40:54.827 align:middle line:84%
This is all play
acting, of course.

00:40:54.827 --> 00:40:59.666 align:middle line:84%
And this man has to wait
all night in the chapel,

00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:01.000 align:middle line:90%
on his own.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.711 align:middle line:84%
And nothing must
interfere with that.

00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:07.882 align:middle line:84%
If it does, then he will be
considered to be a coward.

00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:12.679 align:middle line:84%
But in this re-enactment, in
this degree in Freemasonry,

00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:15.682 align:middle line:84%
there is a battle
going on outside.

00:41:15.682 --> 00:41:19.894 align:middle line:84%
This man can hear
this happening.

00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:22.772 align:middle line:84%
He hears women
being violated, He

00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:25.900 align:middle line:90%
hears his friends being killed.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.111 align:middle line:84%
But he has been
told specifically

00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:31.114 align:middle line:84%
that he must stay where
he is and do nothing.

00:41:31.114 --> 00:41:33.866 align:middle line:90%
But in the end, he can't do it.

00:41:33.866 --> 00:41:35.868 align:middle line:84%
He cannot stay there
and do nothing.

00:41:35.868 --> 00:41:38.037 align:middle line:90%
And so he goes out.

00:41:38.037 --> 00:41:41.249 align:middle line:84%
All his friends come back
in, in the play acting,

00:41:41.249 --> 00:41:45.336 align:middle line:84%
find he's gone, and
think he's run away

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:47.380 align:middle line:90%
claiming to be a coward.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.425 align:middle line:84%
And then some
other men come back

00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:54.554 align:middle line:84%
in carrying the body of
this man on a stretcher.

00:41:54.554 --> 00:41:57.223 align:middle line:90%
And he's been killed in battle.

00:41:57.223 --> 00:42:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of this
particular ceremony,

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:07.024 align:middle line:84%
it's announced that although
he left the chapel, although he

00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:11.112 align:middle line:84%
went against what his
people wanted him to do,

00:42:11.112 --> 00:42:14.073 align:middle line:90%
he was the greatest hero of all.

00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:19.746 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look at what took
place with the upcoming Second

00:42:19.746 --> 00:42:23.124 align:middle line:84%
World War, we know that
at that point in time,

00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:26.669 align:middle line:84%
there was a great deal of
isolationism in the United

00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:27.837 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:30.965 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people in the
US, understandably,

00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:33.593 align:middle line:84%
wanted to keep to
themselves and not

00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:36.929 align:middle line:84%
get involved in yet another
European adventure, which

00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:40.850 align:middle line:84%
had cost so many lives
in the First World War.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:44.353 align:middle line:84%
But Roosevelt had been
through 33 degrees.

00:42:44.353 --> 00:42:47.523 align:middle line:84%
And this one with Constance,
who was the man's name,

00:42:47.523 --> 00:42:52.028 align:middle line:84%
was one that he must have
paid particular attention to.

00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:53.488 align:middle line:84%
In all sorts of
ways, all of this

00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:56.824 align:middle line:84%
is played out on the
streets of Washington, DC.

00:42:56.824 --> 00:43:00.036 align:middle line:90%
But it was in his heart.

00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:04.123 align:middle line:84%
And like Constance,
Roosevelt could not

00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:06.709 align:middle line:90%
leave his friends to suffer.

00:43:06.709 --> 00:43:10.963 align:middle line:84%
He knew that we here
were in a terrible state.

00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:14.592 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, and
because he was a Freemason,

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:18.471 align:middle line:84%
he started to help Britain long
before the Second World War.

00:43:18.471 --> 00:43:20.348 align:middle line:90%
Pearl Harbor cemented it.

00:43:20.348 --> 00:43:21.849 align:middle line:90%
And America came into the war.

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:24.143 align:middle line:84%
But before that,
Roosevelt was doing

00:43:24.143 --> 00:43:26.854 align:middle line:90%
everything he could to help us.

00:43:26.854 --> 00:43:28.314 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we
are sitting here

00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:31.818 align:middle line:84%
now having this conversation
is thanks to Franklin D.

00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:34.445 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt, because
without him, this country

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:36.489 align:middle line:90%
would have gone under.

00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:39.367 align:middle line:84%
And we owe him the
greatest debt of gratitude.

00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:43.538 align:middle line:84%
And I am sure that his
aspirations, his motivations,

00:43:43.538 --> 00:43:49.252 align:middle line:84%
and his actions were ultimately
Freemasonic and Venus family.

00:43:49.252 --> 00:43:52.171 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, as a Brit,
thank you for that honoring

00:43:52.171 --> 00:43:55.174 align:middle line:84%
of our American part of our
history in your country.

00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: You have pulled
us out of it on more than one

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.004 align:middle line:90%
occasion.

00:43:59.004 --> 00:43:59.804 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:01.055 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going to go back.

00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:02.056 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:06.018 align:middle line:84%
Bernard de Clairvaux, Hugh de
Champagne-- and how these men

00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:07.345 align:middle line:90%
factor in from the past.

00:44:07.345 --> 00:44:08.145 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Round about the beginning of
the 12th century, something

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.735 align:middle line:84%
quite astonishing happened
in Western Europe.

00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:17.613 align:middle line:84%
It's the best part
of unknown history,

00:44:17.613 --> 00:44:20.741 align:middle line:84%
because historians
don't allude to it.

00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:24.203 align:middle line:84%
There was a five
or six-pronged plan

00:44:24.203 --> 00:44:28.457 align:middle line:84%
to completely revolutionize
the way Europe was run.

00:44:28.457 --> 00:44:32.837 align:middle line:84%
It was centered upon a place
in Northern France called

00:44:32.837 --> 00:44:36.757 align:middle line:84%
Champagne, and in a city, which
is the capital of Champagne,

00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:38.968 align:middle line:90%
called "Trois" or Troyes.

00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, Champagne was part
of France, but it wasn't.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:45.308 align:middle line:84%
It was one of those
funny states, which

00:44:45.308 --> 00:44:46.893 align:middle line:84%
was associated with
the French throne

00:44:46.893 --> 00:44:48.895 align:middle line:90%
but not under the French throne.

00:44:48.895 --> 00:44:50.396 align:middle line:84%
So they could do
their own thing.

00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:52.239 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Kind of
principality-- >> BUTLER:

00:44:52.239 --> 00:44:54.518 align:middle line:84%
That's right, kind of like
a principality-- a county,

00:44:54.518 --> 00:44:55.318 align:middle line:90%
in that case.

00:44:55.318 --> 00:44:56.118 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:44:56.118 --> 00:44:57.945 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, it was different.

00:44:57.945 --> 00:45:03.784 align:middle line:84%
And it was ruled by a
succession of counts.

00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:07.955 align:middle line:84%
And they had great power
within their own lands.

00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:12.084 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't always get on
very well with the French King.

00:45:12.084 --> 00:45:15.838 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know that the
people in Champagne

00:45:15.838 --> 00:45:22.136 align:middle line:84%
were party to very
old religions.

00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:27.266 align:middle line:84%
Equated with the Virgin Mary
was their own character,

00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:90%
who they called Rose Mirth.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.021 align:middle line:84%
And Rose Mirth was just
another name for Isis,

00:45:32.021 --> 00:45:35.816 align:middle line:84%
for Demeter, for all of
the names of the goddess.

00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:39.111 align:middle line:84%
And when they worshipped the
Virgin Mary, which they weren't

00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:42.448 align:middle line:84%
allowed to do in
church, chances are

00:45:42.448 --> 00:45:46.285 align:middle line:84%
that they were thinking
of their own deity.

00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:48.955 align:middle line:84%
The amount that the Virgin
Mary has gone through,

00:45:48.955 --> 00:45:51.874 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being
changed, by people

00:45:51.874 --> 00:45:57.129 align:middle line:84%
who definitely saw her as a
goddess is quite incredible.

00:45:57.129 --> 00:46:00.216 align:middle line:84%
And they got away with it
because she was Jesus' mother.

00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:03.761 align:middle line:84%
But really, there was a lot
more going on below the surface.

00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:06.389 align:middle line:84%
And just as a side
issue, my wife and I

00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:11.143 align:middle line:84%
went to Malta, the island of
Malta in the Mediterranean.

00:46:11.143 --> 00:46:14.647 align:middle line:90%
There are 365 churches on Malta.

00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of them are
dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:21.278 align:middle line:84%
And you hardly see a statue of
Christ anywhere on the island.

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:23.906 align:middle line:84%
That island worships
the goddess.

00:46:23.906 --> 00:46:25.525 align:middle line:84%
They just give her
a different name.

00:46:25.525 --> 00:46:26.325 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:29.912 align:middle line:84%
And Hugh de Champagne was
also part of the real origins

00:46:29.912 --> 00:46:30.871 align:middle line:90%
of the Knights Templar.

00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:31.539 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: He was.

00:46:31.539 --> 00:46:33.749 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they were
dedicated to Mary Magdalene.

00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:34.583 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:34.834 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:34.834 --> 00:46:36.043 align:middle line:90%
And to Mary the Virgin.

00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:37.837 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And to
Mary the Virgin.

00:46:37.837 --> 00:46:41.007 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: It makes you wonder
what the name Mary actually

00:46:41.007 --> 00:46:43.671 align:middle line:84%
was, or meant, because--
>> REGINA: Well,

00:46:43.671 --> 00:46:45.803 align:middle line:84%
it's the most ubiquitous
name that exists today

00:46:45.803 --> 00:46:47.263 align:middle line:90%
on the planet, I think.

00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:50.425 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: But it comes up so
many times in terms of feminine

00:46:50.425 --> 00:46:51.225 align:middle line:90%
deity.

00:46:51.225 --> 00:46:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.439 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: Anyway,
Hugh of Champagne,

00:46:56.439 --> 00:46:58.691 align:middle line:84%
together with people
that he knew--

00:46:58.691 --> 00:47:02.361 align:middle line:84%
other leading aristocrats
in Champagne--

00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:05.088 align:middle line:84%
decided that the only way
they were ever going to change

00:47:05.088 --> 00:47:07.366 align:middle line:84%
anything was if they
changed the church.

00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So they worked and
worked and worked at it

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.579 align:middle line:84%
until they managed to get one
of their own number elected

00:47:11.579 --> 00:47:13.039 align:middle line:90%
as Pope.

00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:15.833 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
that he did was

00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:21.714 align:middle line:84%
to ask for a crusade, in which
he wanted Jerusalem to be

00:47:21.714 --> 00:47:24.175 align:middle line:90%
recaptured by Christianity.

00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:28.137 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know now that there
was ulterior motives involved--

00:47:28.137 --> 00:47:29.055 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:29.055 --> 00:47:30.598 align:middle line:90%
It was very political.

00:47:30.598 --> 00:47:33.476 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
gathered together,

00:47:33.476 --> 00:47:36.395 align:middle line:84%
a band of kind of fools
and the desperate.

00:47:36.395 --> 00:47:37.229 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:38.439 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:40.024 align:middle line:84%
But in amongst all
that, they also

00:47:40.024 --> 00:47:43.069 align:middle line:84%
created two other organizations
that were important.

00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:45.613 align:middle line:84%
One was the Knights Templar,
that we talked about and will

00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:46.532 align:middle line:90%
talk about.

00:47:46.532 --> 00:47:48.157 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
was an order of monks

00:47:48.157 --> 00:47:50.576 align:middle line:90%
called the Cistercians.

00:47:50.576 --> 00:47:53.329 align:middle line:90%
The Cistercians were amazing.

00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:57.833 align:middle line:84%
They came on the scene so
fresh and new and different,

00:47:57.833 --> 00:48:00.586 align:middle line:84%
and did things in an
entirely different way.

00:48:00.586 --> 00:48:03.255 align:middle line:84%
They were entirely
self-sufficient for one thing.

00:48:03.255 --> 00:48:05.591 align:middle line:90%
They were tremendous farmers.

00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:07.663 align:middle line:84%
They were also very good
engineers-- >> REGINA:

00:48:07.663 --> 00:48:08.803 align:middle line:90%
Mathematicians-- all of it.

00:48:08.803 --> 00:48:10.429 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: Mathematicians,
everything.

00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:13.474 align:middle line:90%
Builders-- everything they did.

00:48:13.474 --> 00:48:17.228 align:middle line:84%
But they became so powerful,
and particularly one of them

00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:19.522 align:middle line:84%
called St. Bernard
of Clairvaux, became

00:48:19.522 --> 00:48:22.358 align:middle line:84%
so powerful that he could
even tell Pope's what to do.

00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:24.235 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He had great
respect among people.

00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:25.277 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Oh, absolutely.

00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:25.861 align:middle line:90%
They loved him.

00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:26.654 align:middle line:90%
They loved him.

00:48:26.654 --> 00:48:28.114 align:middle line:84%
Jewish people
especially loved him,

00:48:28.114 --> 00:48:31.450 align:middle line:84%
because he stopped pogroms
all over the place.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:35.621 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that
with Bernard inventing,

00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:38.499 align:middle line:84%
or virtually inventing,
the Knights Templar,

00:48:38.499 --> 00:48:42.461 align:middle line:84%
and him being so powerful inside
Christianity, at the same time,

00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:46.966 align:middle line:84%
Hugh had started a whole
series of international markets

00:48:46.966 --> 00:48:50.511 align:middle line:84%
in Champagne, which were
called the Champagne Fairs.

00:48:50.511 --> 00:48:52.054 align:middle line:84%
These were designed
to bring people

00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:56.600 align:middle line:84%
in from known and unknown
places, all through the year,

00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:01.772 align:middle line:84%
to buy and sell, to
get money working.

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.315 align:middle line:84%
This was really,
really important

00:49:03.315 --> 00:49:08.404 align:middle line:84%
because medievalism
was also feudalism.

00:49:08.404 --> 00:49:10.865 align:middle line:84%
Everything was owned
by just a few people.

00:49:10.865 --> 00:49:13.909 align:middle line:84%
And ordinary people couldn't
get their hands on any money.

00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:18.581 align:middle line:84%
But this multi-pronged
plan went on in champagne

00:49:18.581 --> 00:49:21.584 align:middle line:84%
was deliberately designed
to break that down,

00:49:21.584 --> 00:49:26.213 align:middle line:84%
to free it all up, to subvert
the power of the church,

00:49:26.213 --> 00:49:27.756 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure
that money started

00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:29.675 align:middle line:90%
to flow throughout society.

00:49:29.675 --> 00:49:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And that wouldn't
have been possible

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:32.678 align:middle line:90%
without the Ciscercians.

00:49:32.678 --> 00:49:34.513 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly wouldn't
have been possible

00:49:34.513 --> 00:49:35.931 align:middle line:90%
without the Knights Templar.

00:49:35.931 --> 00:49:40.999 align:middle line:84%
And Hugh de Payens--
sorry, the count--

00:49:40.999 --> 00:49:45.279 align:middle line:84%
although he wanted to become
one of the original Knights

00:49:45.279 --> 00:49:48.478 align:middle line:84%
Templars, waited a year or two,
and then went and joined them

00:49:48.478 --> 00:49:49.278 align:middle line:90%
in Jerusalem.

00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:51.197 align:middle line:84%
And the title passed
to his nephew,

00:49:51.197 --> 00:49:52.823 align:middle line:84%
once he knew things
were up and running

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.491 align:middle line:90%
the way he wanted them to.

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:57.244 align:middle line:84%
But the other ulterior
motive of his cause

00:49:57.244 --> 00:49:59.997 align:middle line:84%
was to get into Jerusalem
and get things out

00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:03.292 align:middle line:84%
of Jerusalem, which could
be taken to where the New

00:50:03.292 --> 00:50:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Jerusalem was going to be.

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:05.711 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:06.212 align:middle line:90%
The Americas.

00:50:06.212 --> 00:50:07.046 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

00:50:07.046 --> 00:50:07.963 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately.

00:50:07.963 --> 00:50:12.593 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Ultimately-- because
that was quite a bit later.

00:50:12.593 --> 00:50:13.844 align:middle line:90%
We're going to hopscotch here.

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:15.846 align:middle line:84%
We're having so
much fun chatting.

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.681 align:middle line:84%
We're going to hopscotch
through here a bit,

00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:20.893 align:middle line:84%
because we need to get
to the city of Osiris

00:50:20.893 --> 00:50:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and the city of
Isis in particular--

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:24.146 align:middle line:90%
Washington DC.

00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:26.899 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to look at
Leonardo da Vinci as well.

00:50:26.899 --> 00:50:29.109 align:middle line:84%
One thing that people will
note is, wait a minute,

00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:31.862 align:middle line:84%
this is called "America,
a Nation of Goddesses."

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:34.114 align:middle line:84%
So far, all we're hearing
about is these men

00:50:34.114 --> 00:50:35.783 align:middle line:90%
who were the Venus families.

00:50:35.783 --> 00:50:37.409 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
the feminine part

00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:38.869 align:middle line:84%
comes in because
they were devoted

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.579 align:middle line:90%
to these feminine principles.

00:50:40.579 --> 00:50:41.531 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Absolutely.

00:50:41.531 --> 00:50:42.331 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:50:42.331 --> 00:50:44.833 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just trying to
get clear on that for any

00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:48.587 align:middle line:84%
of the women saying, I'm
looking for my story in here.

00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:54.426 align:middle line:84%
So we have these prominent
men, these Venus families,

00:50:54.426 --> 00:50:56.679 align:middle line:84%
devoted to these
feminine principles.

00:50:56.679 --> 00:51:00.599 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have arrived on
what will be American soil.

00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:03.852 align:middle line:84%
And we have the laying
out of Washington, DC.

00:51:03.852 --> 00:51:04.979 align:middle line:90%
So let's go for it there.

00:51:04.979 --> 00:51:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going
to go to the city

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:10.192 align:middle line:84%
of-- as you call it, the city of
Osiris, which is New York City.

00:51:10.192 --> 00:51:11.735 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: New York, yes.

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:15.447 align:middle line:84%
Washington, DC, is
unique in that it's

00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:19.451 align:middle line:84%
one of very few cities in
the world which were planned

00:51:19.451 --> 00:51:22.162 align:middle line:84%
from scratch, and where,
therefore, the designers had

00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:26.125 align:middle line:84%
carte blanche to do
whatever they wanted to do.

00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:28.252 align:middle line:84%
What they started
out by doing was

00:51:28.252 --> 00:51:31.505 align:middle line:84%
to build something
which looks very

00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:36.635 align:middle line:84%
much like an ancient Olmec
or Mayan city, in that it

00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:40.055 align:middle line:84%
is deliberately,
astronomically-aligned

00:51:40.055 --> 00:51:42.099 align:middle line:90%
to the cardinal points.

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And where the
buildings upon it were

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.272 align:middle line:84%
placed in certain positions,
to do certain things

00:51:48.272 --> 00:51:52.901 align:middle line:84%
at certain times of year, to
go into an absolute detailed

00:51:52.901 --> 00:51:54.987 align:middle line:84%
explanation of all the
things that happened

00:51:54.987 --> 00:51:56.780 align:middle line:84%
would take us the
rest of the day.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.701 align:middle line:84%
But there's one thing which
really puts the lid on it,

00:52:00.701 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
Washington Monument.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.499 align:middle line:84%
The Washington Monument is much
more than it appears to be.

00:52:07.499 --> 00:52:08.917 align:middle line:90%
It is where it.

00:52:08.917 --> 00:52:13.297 align:middle line:84%
Is the height it is because
it serves certain functions

00:52:13.297 --> 00:52:15.341 align:middle line:90%
throughout the year.

00:52:15.341 --> 00:52:21.180 align:middle line:84%
One of those functions is that
on the day of the Constitution,

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:24.975 align:middle line:84%
or Constitution Day, as
the sun is going down,

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.978 align:middle line:84%
it casts the shadow from
the Washington Monument that

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:32.191 align:middle line:84%
goes right along the central
mall and just brushes

00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:34.902 align:middle line:84%
the Western doors
of the Capitol.

00:52:34.902 --> 00:52:37.529 align:middle line:84%
What's really
important about it is,

00:52:37.529 --> 00:52:40.282 align:middle line:84%
it could be said that those
who designed this to happen

00:52:40.282 --> 00:52:46.246 align:middle line:84%
were merely commemorating the
signing of the Constitution.

00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:50.709 align:middle line:84%
But that's also the day
of the Elysian ceremonies.

00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, this phenomena
takes place another time

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:58.384 align:middle line:84%
during the year,
which is in March.

00:52:58.384 --> 00:53:04.014 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is no particular
anniversary for America itself

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:05.849 align:middle line:90%
on that particular day.

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:11.063 align:middle line:84%
But it's the date of the
rebirth of the god Attis.

00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And his story is just
a different version

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:20.114 align:middle line:84%
of the retelling of the dying
and reborn god of the grain

00:53:20.114 --> 00:53:22.116 align:middle line:90%
and of the goddess.

00:53:22.116 --> 00:53:25.744 align:middle line:84%
So they have managed, clever
people that they were,

00:53:25.744 --> 00:53:27.996 align:middle line:84%
to build this monument
that does these two

00:53:27.996 --> 00:53:31.458 align:middle line:84%
very specific things on only
two days out of the year.

00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:34.169 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't do it
on any other day.

00:53:34.169 --> 00:53:39.174 align:middle line:84%
And they can say,
this means freedom.

00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:43.929 align:middle line:84%
When the edge of the shadow
touches the Western doors,

00:53:43.929 --> 00:53:47.808 align:middle line:84%
it confirms that
America is free,

00:53:47.808 --> 00:53:52.354 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't have to kowtow
to the old medieval systems

00:53:52.354 --> 00:53:55.475 align:middle line:84%
and to all that went on
back in the old world.

00:53:55.475 --> 00:53:56.275 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:53:56.275 --> 00:54:00.612 align:middle line:90%
We kowtow to Madison Avenue.

00:54:00.612 --> 00:54:03.991 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: But the Washington
Monument itself does lots

00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:04.992 align:middle line:90%
of other things as well.

00:54:04.992 --> 00:54:09.538 align:middle line:84%
For example, just south
of the White House,

00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:12.819 align:middle line:84%
there is a huge
oval of land, which

00:54:12.819 --> 00:54:17.455 align:middle line:84%
is called the Ellipse--
very famous, big park.

00:54:17.455 --> 00:54:18.255 align:middle line:90%
It's elliptical.

00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And various ceremonies
take place there--

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:23.469 align:middle line:90%
but it's open to the public.

00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:27.224 align:middle line:84%
And it used to be a series of
baseball-- >> REGINA: Diamonds.

00:54:27.224 --> 00:54:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: --diamonds.

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:29.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:30.601 align:middle line:90%
I'm English.

00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:32.686 align:middle line:90%
But now, it's just an open park.

00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:34.146 align:middle line:90%
But it's much more than that.

00:54:34.146 --> 00:54:36.023 align:middle line:90%
It has megalithic dimensions.

00:54:36.023 --> 00:54:37.399 align:middle line:84%
You remember the
megalithic yard?

00:54:37.399 --> 00:54:37.733 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:54:37.733 --> 00:54:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.026 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: It's measurable.

00:54:39.026 --> 00:54:42.321 align:middle line:84%
Right across-- 366
megalithic yards exactly.

00:54:42.321 --> 00:54:44.656 align:middle line:84%
So we looked to see what
happens with the shadow

00:54:44.656 --> 00:54:47.117 align:middle line:90%
from the Washington Monument.

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:49.828 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely uncanny.

00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:54.791 align:middle line:84%
On the 21st of December, which
we know is a pagan celebration,

00:54:54.791 --> 00:55:02.257 align:middle line:84%
the tip of the shadow just
grazes the side of the Ellipse.

00:55:02.257 --> 00:55:07.763 align:middle line:84%
And Janet was the first one
who said, this is meant to be.

00:55:07.763 --> 00:55:12.476 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens at
the midwinter solstice.

00:55:12.476 --> 00:55:15.521 align:middle line:84%
It is the meeting of
the god and the goddess.

00:55:15.521 --> 00:55:19.608 align:middle line:84%
It's the fertilization of the
Earth goddess by the sky god.

00:55:19.608 --> 00:55:25.155 align:middle line:84%
And they've symbolized
it through this shadow.

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:28.742 align:middle line:84%
And I could go on and tell
you so many other things.

00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:31.230 align:middle line:84%
One thing I must mention--
tiny, little building

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:35.040 align:middle line:84%
in the grounds of the Capitol
called the Summer House.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.708 align:middle line:84%
Hardly anybody even
knows it's there,

00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:38.877 align:middle line:84%
except the people who
work around there.

00:55:38.877 --> 00:55:40.546 align:middle line:84%
In the summer, they
may go there and sit

00:55:40.546 --> 00:55:41.547 align:middle line:90%
and have the sandwiches.

00:55:41.547 --> 00:55:43.687 align:middle line:84%
And there's a water
fountain in there,

00:55:43.687 --> 00:55:48.178 align:middle line:84%
so you can have a-- but this
particular building is probably

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:51.098 align:middle line:84%
more fascinating than anything
else in Washington, DC,

00:55:51.098 --> 00:55:54.718 align:middle line:84%
because it's a veritable
observatory of Venus

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:55.894 align:middle line:90%
and the Moon.

00:55:55.894 --> 00:55:59.314 align:middle line:84%
It has alignments all
over Washington, DC.

00:55:59.314 --> 00:56:01.233 align:middle line:84%
It was originally going
to be one of the pair.

00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:02.693 align:middle line:84%
There was going
to be two of them.

00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:04.236 align:middle line:84%
But the other one
never got built

00:56:04.236 --> 00:56:07.573 align:middle line:84%
because some of the senators
said, you've got one surmount.

00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:10.576 align:middle line:90%
You can't have another one.

00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:14.413 align:middle line:84%
And you can even work out
the longitude and latitude

00:56:14.413 --> 00:56:17.583 align:middle line:84%
of the moon by standing in
the entrance to this place.

00:56:17.583 --> 00:56:19.751 align:middle line:90%
It's just phenomenal.

00:56:19.751 --> 00:56:21.795 align:middle line:84%
And we keep finding
more and more things

00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:23.213 align:middle line:90%
all over Washington, DC.

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:27.134 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you so much
for making our capital mystical

00:56:27.134 --> 00:56:30.762 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful, and giving it
more dimension than most people

00:56:30.762 --> 00:56:31.597 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:56:31.597 --> 00:56:35.225 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: To me, it's the
most sacred city in the world,

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:36.643 align:middle line:90%
without a shadow of a doubt.

00:56:36.643 --> 00:56:37.519 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:56:37.519 --> 00:56:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: It beats Rome and
Jerusalem into a [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:43.025 align:middle line:84%
because it was deliberately
built that way.

00:56:43.025 --> 00:56:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that hardly
anybody knows it is great.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.946 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't be here
talking to you now,

00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:48.989 align:middle line:90%
because it belongs to me.

00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:49.948 align:middle line:90%
It's mine.

00:56:49.948 --> 00:56:50.866 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:56:50.866 --> 00:56:52.993 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing.

00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:55.414 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you one more
question, while we're on it.

00:56:55.414 --> 00:56:57.289 align:middle line:84%
We'll go up a little
north to the city of New

00:56:57.289 --> 00:56:58.582 align:middle line:90%
York, the city of Osiris.

00:56:58.582 --> 00:56:59.958 align:middle line:84%
And tell us your
thoughts on that

00:56:59.958 --> 00:57:02.127 align:middle line:84%
and what you've observed
before we wrap it up.

00:57:02.127 --> 00:57:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: OK.

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.842 align:middle line:84%
One of the things about New
York is central station,

00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:12.512 align:middle line:84%
which everybody knows about--
fantastic-looking building.

00:57:12.512 --> 00:57:15.216 align:middle line:84%
And on the roof of New
York's Central-- >> REGINA:

00:57:15.216 --> 00:57:16.016 align:middle line:90%
Grand Central.

00:57:16.016 --> 00:57:19.728 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: --Grand
Central-- is a star map.

00:57:19.728 --> 00:57:22.981 align:middle line:84%
Now, the star map shows all
the major constellations

00:57:22.981 --> 00:57:27.444 align:middle line:84%
of the Milky Way and of
the plane of the ecliptic.

00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:30.489 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that
they're all back to front.

00:57:30.489 --> 00:57:33.241 align:middle line:84%
Nobody really understood
why they were back to front.

00:57:33.241 --> 00:57:35.786 align:middle line:84%
But all sorts of ideas
have been put forward

00:57:35.786 --> 00:57:39.289 align:middle line:84%
about how the architect made
projections from the floor.

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:44.336 align:middle line:84%
And so everything ended up as
if the sky appeared on the West,

00:57:44.336 --> 00:57:47.297 align:middle line:84%
whereas in fact, it appears on
the East and turns that way.

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:48.632 align:middle line:90%
But there is an exception.

00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:52.135 align:middle line:84%
And that exception is a
constellation called Orion.

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:55.681 align:middle line:84%
Orion is the only constellation
on the ceiling of the station

00:57:55.681 --> 00:57:58.517 align:middle line:90%
that is the correct way round.

00:57:58.517 --> 00:58:01.019 align:middle line:84%
That could not have happened--
>> REGINA: By accident.

00:58:01.019 --> 00:58:02.354 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: --by accident.

00:58:02.354 --> 00:58:04.731 align:middle line:84%
It's understandable that
they've got the whole thing back

00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:06.692 align:middle line:90%
to front, but not--

00:58:06.692 --> 00:58:09.611 align:middle line:84%
[INTERPOSING VOICES] >> REGINA:
--one aspect correct, yes.

00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:11.655 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: So Janet
and I thought,

00:58:11.655 --> 00:58:13.156 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
tell us something.

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And we already
knew that Orion was

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:18.682 align:middle line:84%
very important to our ancient
ancestors-- and, in particular,

00:58:18.682 --> 00:58:21.790 align:middle line:84%
part of Orion, which is called
Orion's Belt. Now, Orion's Belt

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:24.710 align:middle line:84%
is three stars in a row, but
there's just a very slight dog

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:25.794 align:middle line:90%
leg.

00:58:25.794 --> 00:58:27.379 align:middle line:84%
So you always know
when you're looking

00:58:27.379 --> 00:58:30.090 align:middle line:84%
at something that represents
Orion's Belt, because it

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.007 align:middle line:90%
looks straight.

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:32.634 align:middle line:84%
But if you look very
carefully, there's

00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:34.553 align:middle line:84%
a very slight dog
leg in the middle.

00:58:34.553 --> 00:58:39.391 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking at
other examples of obelisks

00:58:39.391 --> 00:58:42.728 align:middle line:90%
like the one in Washington, DC.

00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:50.235 align:middle line:84%
And Janet, god bless her,
found three particular obelisk.

00:58:50.235 --> 00:58:52.904 align:middle line:84%
The northernmost one
is in Central Park

00:58:52.904 --> 00:58:56.776 align:middle line:84%
and is truly Egyptian,
because it was brought across.

00:58:56.776 --> 00:58:57.576 align:middle line:90%
And it matches.

00:58:57.576 --> 00:58:59.327 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the pair.

00:58:59.327 --> 00:59:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is, like,
two minutes walk from here.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, it is--
right across the river.

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.878 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: And I think you
call yours Cleopatra's Needle

00:59:07.878 --> 00:59:09.421 align:middle line:90%
as well, as we call ours.

00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:11.256 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, it's there.

00:59:11.256 --> 00:59:13.633 align:middle line:84%
And there are two much
more modern obelisks

00:59:13.633 --> 00:59:16.261 align:middle line:90%
as we come down Manhattan.

00:59:16.261 --> 00:59:20.098 align:middle line:84%
And I love to do graphics
and things like that there,

00:59:20.098 --> 00:59:21.975 align:middle line:90%
and very accurate measurements.

00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:24.936 align:middle line:84%
And so I put all these on
a map, and I measured them

00:59:24.936 --> 00:59:26.480 align:middle line:90%
as accurately as I could.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:31.536 align:middle line:84%
I took the positions of the
real Orion's Belt in the sky,

00:59:31.536 --> 00:59:34.237 align:middle line:90%
scaled it up, and placed it on.

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:36.907 align:middle line:90%
And it's absolutely perfect.

00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:44.498 align:middle line:84%
They have recreated Orion's Belt
down the length of New York.

00:59:44.498 --> 00:59:50.496 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom of the three
is by St. Paul's Church-- >>

00:59:50.496 --> 00:59:51.296 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mhm.

00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:52.096 align:middle line:90%
Cathedral.

00:59:52.096 --> 00:59:56.968 align:middle line:84%
>> BUTLER: --which is right
by ground zero, and somehow,

00:59:56.968 --> 00:59:59.971 align:middle line:90%
miraculously, survived.

00:59:59.971 --> 01:00:01.723 align:middle line:90%
And that really was a miracle.

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:07.062 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the kind of
business which had gone on

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.939 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, DC,
in terms of making

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:13.652 align:middle line:84%
these places holy and
special, has been perpetuated

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:15.695 align:middle line:90%
in other cities too.

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:18.156 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
big job that we are

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:20.575 align:middle line:90%
opening new doors all the time.

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:23.245 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously much more in
New York that we haven't seen.

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:25.747 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that Washington
has so much that we keep

01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:27.165 align:middle line:90%
getting dragged back to it.

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:29.793 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I wish you'd
just focus on San Francisco.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:33.088 align:middle line:84%
But I'm afraid we may not find
that there is a lot of people

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:36.007 align:middle line:84%
who made some money in the
gold mining days, who ended up

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:37.133 align:middle line:90%
on the Barbary Coast.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.261 align:middle line:84%
And other things
happened instead.

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:40.846 align:middle line:90%
But we are out of time.

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:43.682 align:middle line:84%
But I have to tell you, it's
been such a fascinating journey

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:44.516 align:middle line:90%
with you.

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:48.103 align:middle line:84%
And even though you won't see
the names of a lot of women

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:50.397 align:middle line:84%
in your book, the
whole intention

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
is that these men were dedicated
to the feminine principles

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.562 align:middle line:90%
and the Venusian principles.

01:00:56.562 --> 01:00:57.362 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Yes.

01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:59.197 align:middle line:84%
And the whole book is
dedicated to women.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:00:59.614 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

01:00:59.614 --> 01:00:59.781 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to thank you
so much, you and Janet both,

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.035 align:middle line:84%
for the incredible
research you did on this,

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:05.537 align:middle line:84%
and putting it all
together for us.

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:08.707 align:middle line:84%
And do let us know, the more
you discover on Washington Dc,

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:10.166 align:middle line:90%
and maybe even San Francisco.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:11.167 align:middle line:90%
>> BUTLER: Well, I will.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.836 align:middle line:84%
And as we say in the
North of England,

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.170 align:middle line:90%
thank you for having me.

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:16.172 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, indeed.

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.717 align:middle line:84%
Again, the name of the
book is "America, Nation

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:21.553 align:middle line:84%
of Goddesses," which can be
found at major booksellers.

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:23.722 align:middle line:84%
