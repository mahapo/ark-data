00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Our fascination

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.850 align:middle line:10%
with revised ancient history
is endless, but to what end?

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:10%
According to Jason
Quitt, it's an invitation

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:10%
to heal our collective
and personal pasts.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:84%
As a lifelong experiencer
of strange phenomena,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:84%
he has taken some profound
journeys, some of which

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.740 align:middle line:84%
he will share with us in
this interview right now.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, there's
so much to talk about.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Off-camera I said, god,
we could talk for hours.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
hopscotching around.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.366 align:middle line:84%
So, I just want the audience
to know, we're probably

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
going to go on one tangential
journey after another,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.580 align:middle line:84%
because that's your
experience in life.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON QUITT: Absolutely.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.482 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So,
welcome to the show.

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's just start
talking about the beginning,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.815 align:middle line:84%
for those who don't know
who you are already,

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and what your life was
like as a little kid,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:90%
and just take it from there.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:10%
>>QUITT: Sure.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:10%
I grew up with a
very strong memory,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:10%
and that memory was me coming
to this planet as a child.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.539 align:middle line:84%
I remember going
through a dark portal

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and then ending up in a
place that kind of looked

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
like an airport, and there
were lots of children there,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:84%
just small children going
down these hallways.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And from my child's
perspective, it

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
looked like that these ladies
were almost like airline

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:84%
stewardesses directing these
children, and one of them

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:84%
said to me, it's now time for
you to choose your parents.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And they took me
down another hallway,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and this hallway had
these small little doors,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and they opened a small little
door and I went through,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and it was almost like I
went into this movie theater

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and this portal opened
up in front of me,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and I got to sit there
and view my parents.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Moments of their
lives, their wedding.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
sitting there so happy

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
that I can view my parents, and
I knew I was going to be born,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:84%
I was very excited, and the
next thing I knew I was here.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I first started
to learn how to talk,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I would tell my mother, aren't
you happy I chose you, ma?

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And mothers would say,
well, that's something

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:90%
very cute a child would say.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it actually
came from a memory.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
It came from a place
that was very strong.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought
that was normal,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.550 align:middle line:84%
we all had these memories,
we all choose our parents,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:90%
we all live past lives.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like I
came into this world

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
already with that knowing,
and even at an early age--

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and I mean early, like
four or five years old,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I was already having past life
memories coming back to me.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And these past
life memories, they

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.170 align:middle line:90%
were all extremely traumatic.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So, it's almost like when you
go back in these past lives,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:90%
it's usually viewing your death.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So, as a child, I would actually
go on these journeys or visions

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
out of body, where I would have
relive these past life deaths.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were very, very
gruesome, very hard to watch.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, I
thought, what is this?

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.984 align:middle line:84%
And then the more
that it happened,

00:03:32.984 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize
that I was actually

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
watching another me at
their last moments of life.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So, for me growing up,
I always had this sense

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that we live many
lives, that we come

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:84%
here, we choose our
path and our purpose

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and our parents for certain
reasons, and even as a child,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
I would say I was
gifted, or psychic.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I would always have things
coming into the room at night,

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
my closet door would always
open in the middle of the night,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:90%
and it always was very scary.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Very scary.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd always run to the door
and try to close that door,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and in the middle of the
night, it would just open

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.113 align:middle line:84%
and there would be this
being standing in my closet.

00:04:18.113 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
about the being.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: You know,
from a child's mind

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:90%
it looked like a scarecrow.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:90%
And it really did.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It looked like-- the
only way I could describe

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
it is a dehydrated
person, and from far away,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
it just looks like a
shadow, this dark shadow.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I never really understood
what it was there for,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
but at nighttime, sometimes
it would take me on journeys.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And at first it was almost
like they were taking me

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
on time travel
journeys where it's

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
like, if I looked out
the window of the house,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
it would be a
different environment.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.870 align:middle line:90%
So, it's almost like a dream.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking back into
time and it looks like fields,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:90%
like a farmer's field.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And then they would take
me down into my basement

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and they would take
me to some room

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.877 align:middle line:84%
and they'd show that
there's a coffin there,

00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and they would open
the coffin I would

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
see this figure
inside this coffin

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and it was almost like they were
trying to show me or tell me

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that either this was them or
this was me in a past life.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the
answers from a child,

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.246 align:middle line:84%
but I would often
run to my parents.

00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, because
you're a child.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they believe you
and what you were experiencing,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.230 align:middle line:84%
or did they think it was
mostly your imagination?

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Oh, they
just calmed me down.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
these experiences,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
especially the past life
ones, were so traumatic

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:90%
that, you know--

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:90%
You feel everything again.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Oh, yeah.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can barely express
what just happened to you.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And a parent obviously
loves their child,

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
they calm the child
down and they say,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
everything's all right,
it's just a nightmare.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has nightmares, so
I just believed that what I saw

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and what I did was
something called nightmares,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and that was perfectly normal,
and everybody did what I did.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:90%
So, I just lived normally.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.515 align:middle line:84%
And even the house I grew up
in, definitely a paranormal.

00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
It was-- you know, I would
walk past my basement

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and I would hear talking, or
conversations, in my basement,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.345 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll follow the
voices and they just disappear.

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But your parents
didn't experience these things

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:90%
or hear these things?

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: No, it was just me--

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:90%
and my brother.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
My brother, as well,
had these experiences.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I would say his were a
little more traumatic,

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:90%
or I would say funnier.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:84%
My brother also had paranormal
activity in our house

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that we grew up in, and one of
the most memorable things that

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:84%
happened was, at nighttime,
he said that somebody pulled

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
his pillow out
from under his head

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and started hitting him with it.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And when he went
to fight back, he

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
said the pillow flew
across the room.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And then he ran into my
bedroom to wake me up,

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and he starts hitting me,
thinking that I was in his room

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.430 align:middle line:90%
hitting him with the pillow.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:90%
It was just some weird force.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I did another story
with a mother in England

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.490 align:middle line:90%
who has a son who's like you.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:90%
He's known for his abilities.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:84%
But it was the very
same thing growing up.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:90%
It was both of them.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:90%
It was he and the brother.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:90%
So I don't--

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I find that kind of interesting,
because you kind of come out

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.660 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:84%
What has your brother
done with that?

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: My brother
is very grounded

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual, great
guy, but he hasn't really

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
spoken publicly about the
things that he's witnessed.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And he's told me some things
that he's been through

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.537 align:middle line:84%
or he's seen, and
they're amazing stories--

00:07:55.537 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he doesn't
give you permission

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:90%
to talk about them, per se?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It would
be very off topic,

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:84%
but I definitely
could get into it.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.067 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we could, but
first of all, just kind of-- we

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:90%
have so much else to talk about.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But he's OK with
you sharing, he just

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to have to take
that kind of fire right now?

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Oh, yeah.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, I used to have
beings come and visit me

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:90%
at nighttime.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was practicing
qigong one night,

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and it was almost
like this explosion

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:90%
happened inside my body.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, you could actually
hear the explosion.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
strange experience.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have a close
friend in the family who

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
is a psychic and channeler, so
I immediately called them up

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and I say, this very strange
thing happened to me.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I was doing qigong, I had
this explosion happen,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.410 align:middle line:90%
and it shook my whole body.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And they started to channel
for me and they said,

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
you just entered
into a new dimension.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:84%
You've expanded your awareness
into a new dimension.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.547 align:middle line:90%
Your fields are different now.

00:08:58.547 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they said,
you're going to be

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
invisible to those beings that
have been coming and visiting

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.120 align:middle line:84%
you because you're not in
their dimensions anymore.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
That night-- and this is when
I still lived at home with

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:90%
my mother and my brother--

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that night, a bunch of
beings visited my brother

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:90%
and started to interrogate him.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.324 align:middle line:84%
They were asking
him, where am I?

00:09:21.324 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.564 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Where did I go?

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
wonderful validation.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.313 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: So he knocks on
my door the next morning,

00:09:28.313 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and he's like, Jay, I've
got something to tell you.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, these beings
came, and they were actually

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:90%
very rude.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:84%
They were, like, almost
interrogating me.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Where is Jason?

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you
what he told them,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:84%
but he basically told
them to go take a hike.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.492 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:09:45.492 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:90%
We can guess.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And it
just validated what

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:84%
happened in my
qigong experience,

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
from that explosion
that I experienced,

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.150 align:middle line:84%
and then from the
channeler, who also said,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:90%
you shifted out of a dimension.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think It's a
good place to jump out on,

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
because this is
happening a lot of times

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:90%
when we're unaware of it.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
When people have
their experiences,

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they are shifting
kind of frequency [? bands. ?]

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I've had some of my own
experience in that area.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the nature-- we

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
are multi-dimensional
to begin with.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the ways in which

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:84%
we can shift into
another band, and what

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:90%
the repercussions of that are.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get into
the whole notion of time,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
the notion of parallel
lives, all of it.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So, let's just start with
multi-dimensionality.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Sure.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
we're experiencing

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
this third-dimensional
world through our senses,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and there are things outside
of us that we're unaware of.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
But we actually have bodies,
or awarenesses, outside of us

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
that we just haven't
awakened yet,

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:90%
or we're just not aware of.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
to awaken, it first

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.625 align:middle line:90%
started with me leaving my body.

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Out-of-body
experience.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Out-of-body experience.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So that was my
first introduction

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:90%
into multi-dimensionality.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, when
you meet someone

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:84%
that had a near-death
experience,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:84%
or someone who has
astral traveled or left

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
their body, for them, it's
like everything in their world

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
changes because,
finally, they understand

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to life than
this third-dimensional space.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a
very freeing thing,

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
because once you
get out of your body

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that there
is more after death, even--

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you're eternal, your
energy, your consciousness

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
is outside of your body, and
your body is just basically

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
your vessel to explore the
third-dimensional worlds.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So, everybody's
talking about ascension

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.510 align:middle line:90%
and what ascension is.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
For me, ascension is not
disappearing or a rapture--

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: --or
anything like that.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not at all.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: For me, ascension
is expanding your awareness

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
outside of your senses,
and that is extremely

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:90%
freeing and enlightening.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you speak
to people that

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
have been outside of their
body, or near death experience,

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:84%
they'll tell you that it's more
real than the physical world.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It has this almost
surreal reality

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:84%
that, once you enter it,
you know that this is real.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.150 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
we're living the dream

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, very true.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, even when you--

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
as you mentioned a
little while ago,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.830 align:middle line:84%
even when you pass
into past lifetimes,

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
it's more real, more
visceral, more memorable

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
than what we are
doing right now,

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
just going back into that field
of what occurred-- supposedly,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:90%
then or now.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And what I realized
is, the most important thing

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
out of those past life
journeys is to feel.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: It's that emotion.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:84%
You're carrying that
emotion from life to life.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you how
many times I've gone back

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:84%
to past lives where it's
almost like you're processing

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that death that maybe
wasn't processed back then,

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you're ready
to process it now.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And as you process it, you're
releasing such deep emotions

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that you literally feel
your cells opening up.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like they crack, and
suddenly these things come out

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:90%
of you, and it changes you.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It really does shift
and change you.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, ascension
is moving your awareness

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
outside of your
body and becoming

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:90%
a multi-dimensional being.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into time
travel, gets into ghosts--

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we'll
get into as much

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.979 align:middle line:84%
as we can in this
short amount of time.

00:13:48.979 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Let me just ask you
one question, just kind

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:90%
of a little personal survey.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Of course.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When you go into--

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:84%
when you've gone into
past life experiences,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:84%
do you know do you notice
whether you're dominantly male

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:90%
in those incarnations?

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking because I
ask a lot of people

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:90%
what they notice when they go.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:84%
For me, I can recall a couple of
times in which I was male, very

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:84%
ancient times, but it's
always female, otherwise.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think, for
most people, it's

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:84%
the same, which does have
its own range of experience

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.376 align:middle line:90%
Because I can dream time--

00:14:23.376 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:84%
men, oftentimes,
like you say, when

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.368 align:middle line:84%
you go to these
past lives, they're

00:14:26.368 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
such awful, oftentimes
bloody, gory, violent deaths

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
because of the nature of
men's occupations up--

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.829 align:middle line:90%
well, even now, I suppose.

00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Oh, I would
completely agree.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And I listen to
other people tell me

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
about their
spiritual awakenings,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual visions they
have, and a lot of them

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:84%
are so beautiful
and so enlightening.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, I wish my
experience was like yours.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Were they women?

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: They were
mostly women, yes.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to
say, that's probably why.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: With me,
they were, you know,

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:84%
let's throw Jason into
a war for a night.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.474 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Let's give him trauma.

00:15:07.474 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But men carry--
let's talk about that.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Men carry a
different kind, but I

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.145 align:middle line:84%
would say, a higher amount
of trauma in their beings,

00:15:18.145 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:84%
in the aura, in their
memory field, than women do.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Women have control, rape, all
these other kinds of things.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:90%
There are other kinds of abuses.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But to repeat heatedly be
sent, for example, into battle,

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:84%
lifetime after
lifetime, what have you

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.532 align:middle line:84%
noticed by way of
collective trauma?

00:15:35.532 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It's an
excellent question

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
because it really bothered me
for a very long time, where

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I'd go back to past lives.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.882 align:middle line:84%
Like, I remember
lifetimes in Japan,

00:15:46.882 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and I can't even tell
you how gruesome that is.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no,
you don't need to.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Vivisection, all
kinds of things.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And the thing
is, is that collectively,

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:84%
men have this very ancient
trauma which makes them--

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and we've carried it for so
long, and we've met each other,

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and you can see how soft and
sensitive I am in real life.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I've been
through so much,

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and all my past lives are
so gruesome that I've even

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:84%
been told that,
in this life, I've

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
chosen the complete
opposite so that I

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.730 align:middle line:90%
can work that energy out.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've been told and
taught that to be incarnate

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and to be a being in
this world, in any world,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.650 align:middle line:90%
we have to play all roles.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the experience.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So, you can't be the
devil or the angel,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:90%
you have just experience.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all about this
polarity of consciousness.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So, if I would go
back in a past life

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
that's very
traumatic or warlike,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and when you're doing
not so nice things,

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and then you go to lifetimes
where you're priests

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:84%
and healers and shamans,
and it's almost like

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
you have this
polarity of extremes,

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking those
experiences of those extremes

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're using them to
better your experience now

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.931 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:17:16.931 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.496 align:middle line:84%
I did a show recently
on dreams, and one thing

00:17:20.496 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:84%
the man was talking about--
my guest was talking about--

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:84%
was the nature of the types
of dreams men and women have.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And with men,
they're more fearful,

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:84%
they often have more
violence in them.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Women's are more collective, a
lot more people in the dreams.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.469 align:middle line:84%
And in this kind of
collective dream of humanity,

00:17:38.469 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned to him one
thing I've noticed--

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to know
your perception of it--

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:84%
is that, I know a number
of men who I've talked to,

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
we talk about
dreams, and they'll

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.476 align:middle line:84%
say they're no longer capable
of being violent in the dream

00:17:49.476 --> 00:17:50.276 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:17:50.276 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Hm.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I think it has to do with
the energy that you carry.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So, when you go through
inner transformation,

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:84%
your dreams will change,
your experience will change.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.234 align:middle line:90%
And I really think--

00:18:05.234 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:90%
I use the word think--

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
and think that we're

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
part of this group
consciousness, this group mind,

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and it has to do with the
Earth's magnetic field

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:90%
and the photons of the sun.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
There's some type of
correlation between this.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.157 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to see
more and more of that.

00:18:23.157 --> 00:18:24.990 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, they
talk about this thing

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:84%
called the "Book of Life,"
where your life is recorded,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and I believe everything that
we think and everything we do

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:84%
gets recorded in the
Earth's magnetic field

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.659 align:middle line:84%
so that when beings
come and incarnate here,

00:18:39.659 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
they may come from other
worlds and other planets

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and they have no idea of
what a human experience is,

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:84%
so when they get here, because
of the path they've chosen,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
they actually inherit a
collective memory of what

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:90%
it is to be human.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So, that's why there's
so many people that

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:84%
claim to be the same
being from the past,

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:84%
or have the same memories
of the past life,

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:84%
because we're all tapped
in to this Book of Life,

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
or this Akashic memory
of the planet, which

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.004 align:middle line:90%
helps us experience who we

00:19:10.004 --> 00:19:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've had some of
those own experiences yourself.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about, when you're

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
Akashic record, one time

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.024 align:middle line:90%
jettisoned out of my body--

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and I think I had actually
crossed into dream time--

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing those vector points
and where the information was

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:84%
kind of held in those vector
points of the lines crossing.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And a fair amount of
grid stuff has happened,

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:90%
including in the past life--

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Atlantian life thing,
where I was talking

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:84%
about the sun and this grid and
how we just ruined it when--

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.430 align:middle line:90%
it was when, the big boom.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And that.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And you have seen
these grids, as well.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk a little bit
about what that grid is about,

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and about information
being held,

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
before we move into
the nature of time.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Sure.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And the best way
to describe it is,

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like the
interweb, or the internet,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And you have all these
networks of memories

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
of collective consciousness,
and it's almost

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
like a neural
network of pathways.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So, when we're in
a certain resonance

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:84%
or a certain energetic
field, or born

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:84%
in a certain place
at a certain time,

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:84%
we're inherently connected
to all these different grid

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
systems, which will
help our experience

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and help us connect
to the knowledge

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
that we'll take forward
in our lifetime.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And many people can
actually see this grid.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And you've said you've
seen this grid, too.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I could be having a
conversation with you,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.545 align:middle line:90%
and I'll see these vectors.

00:20:32.545 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that's what I see.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: And they're, like--

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.197 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it lights
up at certain points,

00:20:36.197 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:90%
where they cross.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It lights up at
certain points, right.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm having a
conversation with someone,

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I can see, OK, they're
getting information

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:84%
from this world, this
dimension, this being,

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to prompt
them to say something.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So, it's amazing to watch how
this whole interconnectedness

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness works.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And even, let's say, I'll talk
to a person, I'll see this--

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.590 align:middle line:84%
it's like this spark,
just a spark opens up.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Purple, or?

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: All different colors.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All different colors?

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It could be any
color, depending on the person.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And it just opens
up next to them,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'll feel that
wave of energy,

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and the person feels
it, and I'll say,

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.761 align:middle line:84%
there's a higher being
sitting next to you

00:21:19.761 --> 00:21:20.760 align:middle line:90%
or standing next to you.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
yeah, I can feel it.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's almost like--

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.464 align:middle line:84%
that's with the physical
eyes, I can see that.

00:21:29.464 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So, there's all this
interconnectedness.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And just by the way we think,
and how we resonate with,

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:90%
we activate these grids.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually been
told, on the other side,

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that being physical,
having your feet

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:84%
on the ground in
this physical world,

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
thing, because you're almost

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:84%
like this connection between
these dimensional worlds

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and the physical world, and
every step that you take,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
you carry these amazing
universal grids within you.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you step on the
Earth with your feet,

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
you're connecting
your universal grids

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:84%
to the universal
grids of the Earth,

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and you're lighting
up all these fields,

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and you're activating
different energy systems

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
So just by being
incarnate, you're

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.594 align:middle line:84%
actually doing a service by
connecting and activating

00:22:17.594 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:84%
these grids of consciousness
that you're describing.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hm.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.474 align:middle line:84%
The one I mentioned a
bit ago about Atlantis,

00:22:23.474 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:84%
which I've mentioned on a
couple of other occasions,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:84%
it was that the end time,
and Dolores Cannon--

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:90%
the late Dolores Cannon--

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
did a regression
with me and ended up

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:90%
in convoluted universe.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
But the point being,
among everything

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that was going on at that
time, that sad, sad day, was--

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and I was crying, saying, we've
ruined this delicate matrix,

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:84%
this relationship between
the Earth and the sun

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:84%
that's been so
carefully developed.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And we don't think
about what happens

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:84%
when we have destructive
events upon the planet.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, with all
the nuclear testing

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%
that happened decades
ago all over this planet,

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:84%
did you ever get any
insight as to what that does

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:90%
to disrupt the larger field?

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I think we're all
feeling the effect of it now.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like,
when you collapsed,

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:21.710 align:middle line:84%
when the grid collapsed, that
was consciousness fields.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So, you have people that their
consciousness is connected

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:84%
to these very fine
grids that are set up,

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and when it
collapses, it's almost

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.009 align:middle line:84%
like you lose your
collective memory.

00:23:33.009 --> 00:23:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting,
because I know

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go far enough
into that regression

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.432 align:middle line:84%
to see what that
grid actually meant.

00:23:38.432 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I was just saying what
I was saying then,

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.660 align:middle line:90%
and we're out of it.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that has to do
with consciousness,

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
but is it a
consciousness that also

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.640 align:middle line:84%
is taking place
between the Earth

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and cosmic systems
and ourselves?

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: There's no
separation of that.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:90%
There's no separation.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
The Earth grids
and the Sun grids,

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:84%
the Sun's connect to all
the suns in the universe

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
through these grids,
they're out in space,

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:84%
they come down here to
the Earth grids, which

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is the magnetic fields of the
Earth and the etheric lines,

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
and we're part of that.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:84%
We are made up of the same
grids, the same photons run

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:84%
through us, the same magnetic
fields run through us.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So as we're experiencing
this world, our thoughts,

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.310 align:middle line:84%
our emotion, our energy that
we generate here actually goes

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
through the earth grids,
goes up to the sun grids,

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:33.710 align:middle line:84%
the sun grids reach all the
other suns, and there's--

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like we're
co-creating reality.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So with our energies and
our input in time and space,

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:84%
we send waves of
new consciousness

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.440 align:middle line:84%
through the universe,
and the universe then

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:90%
sends these waves back to us.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this, the sun--

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
the central sun
and the visible sun

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:84%
that we see in our solar
system, and the nature

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.947 align:middle line:90%
of what they actually are to us.

00:24:55.947 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And the
hidden sun within us.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.738 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the hidden sun.

00:24:58.738 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yeah.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So, all these suns are
basically connections

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
people, or many beings,

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that can actually leave
their body and travel--

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean the true word,
stargate, right?

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:90%
These are stargates.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.800 align:middle line:90%
And they are our source.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:90%
We are made of solar energy.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:90%
We live in the visible world.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:90%
We're made up of photons.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So, our relationship
with the sun,

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:84%
we are basically solar
consciousness beings.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And because we're solar
consciousness beings,

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
it's the sun's
energy that is our--

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll call it the purest
source of our consciousness.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So we go out in the sun, we
can sungaze, we can do qigong,

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:84%
we can pull these
photons through us,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.640 align:middle line:84%
grow our solar energy
within ourselves

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and our body and our
energetic fields,

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and when we leave our
body, we are like suns.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:90%
We're like illuminated beings.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And we can connect and
resonate to different stars,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
different star systems,
and travel the universe,

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.356 align:middle line:84%
and be one with the solar
energies, these solar beings.

00:26:15.356 --> 00:26:16.182 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:26:16.182 --> 00:26:19.430 align:middle line:84%
In, for example, the
hermetic tradition,

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:84%
the path back to the sun
is kind of the holy grail

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.590 align:middle line:84%
on a consciousness
scale, finding

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:84%
one's way back into that
true solar pure energy

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:84%
beyond the need for physical
incarnation, at least

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and
in this dimension.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Any comments there?

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, you know,
in religion or in history,

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:84%
they always talk about, these
archaic, ancient people,

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
they prayed to the sun, they
were sun worshippers, or--

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Savages.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Savages.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient
traditions, I would

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.642 align:middle line:84%
say the correct translation
is children of the sun.

00:26:55.642 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what they returned
as, children of the sun.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're all children of
the sun, and we need the sun.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
We have the sun
flowing through us.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was a
famous biophotonist,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I think his name was [? Pop. ? ]
He came to this conclusion that

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:84%
the meridian system
of the body--

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
he called the acupuncture
points solar vacuums.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:25.816 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: And it would pull--

00:27:25.816 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:84%
the acupuncture points
will pull the solar energy

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
through the acupuncture points,
and it will go like streams

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.864 align:middle line:90%
through the meridian system.

00:27:33.864 --> 00:27:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, makes sense.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And so we
were like solar vacuums

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
taking in solar light
energy as our consciousness.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And the more coherent
that light was,

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
the more pure that light
was, the more enlightened

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and awakened and healthy
that person would be.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.972 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
flip that, now.

00:27:52.972 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's go the other way.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Because you've experienced
having to interface with

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and being shown
the other realms.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:90%
We know what we are linked to--

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:04.130 align:middle line:84%
quite naturally, if we
choose, this relationship

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:84%
with the solar forces
and high consciousness,

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:middle line:84%
but we live on a planet that
allows for many dimensions

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:90%
to interface at the same time.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about some
of the lower dimensions,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:84%
or Satanist groups that worship
the low sun, for example.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And you've experience some
intrusion of lower realm

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.060 align:middle line:90%
entities and such, at times.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It frightened you a
little bit, as I recall.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: To be here, you have
to deal with these intrusions.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anybody
that doesn't.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's just part of
the experience here,

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.630 align:middle line:90%
and it's part of being asleep.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say this
is because we grow up

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.590 align:middle line:84%
in, I would say,
an altered reality.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not our true
vision of a creation,

00:28:55.430 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're kept in a
very straight line.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So, we're not supposed to
see outside of that line.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are
beings just outside

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.190 align:middle line:84%
of our visual realm
that connect to us.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:90%
They could even feed us visions.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
They could channel
through us, like we

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.210 align:middle line:84%
could think we're hearing the
word of God, but it's not.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
manipulation out there.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And they could actually implant
memories and thought forms

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.962 align:middle line:90%
inside of us.

00:29:27.962 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
think they're real.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're sincere when we
share these with the world.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Yikes.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.961 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Not only do
we think they're real,

00:29:35.961 --> 00:29:38.300 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it comes
in our own voice,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
so we think we're
telling ourselves

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:90%
these grand, amazing things.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go
through a teaching,

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very
powerful teaching.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Your Thought
Forms Are Not Your Own".

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I remember reading that.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yeah.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.331 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
most powerful teachings

00:29:57.331 --> 00:30:01.110 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever gone through,
because when I was taught this,

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:06.080 align:middle line:84%
they said to me,
whenever a thought pops

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.340 align:middle line:84%
into your mind, whenever you
start to visualize something,

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:84%
or a vision comes to you,
right when it happens,

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:17.600 align:middle line:84%
stop it and say, you are
not my thought forms,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.550 align:middle line:90%
please leave now.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:90%
So that became my mantra.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:90%
And I was very confused.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't understand why my
own voice would not be mine.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I couldn't
understand it.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But I continued,
because I trusted,

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and I kept saying, you
are not my thought forms,

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.050 align:middle line:90%
please leave now.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And something actually
happened to me.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.210 align:middle line:90%
And it was a physical thing.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:45.125 align:middle line:10%
I felt this thing in
the center of my brain--

00:30:45.125 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:10%
it's the only way I
could describe it--

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.189 align:middle line:10%
it turned.

00:30:50.189 --> 00:30:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And there was a clicking sound.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, I felt something
go [CLICK] in the middle

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:84%
of my brain, and when that
happened, I heard silence--

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.950 align:middle line:84%
for the first time in my life,
what silence sounded like.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.910 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing going on
in my mind, no thoughts.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And it just dawned
on me, this is

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
what maybe the meditators
are trying to achieve,

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.550 align:middle line:90%
or this no-mind business.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was experiencing.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And one night I was sleeping,
and I was having a dream,

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and in this dream my own
voice said to me, Jason,

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:90%
you're going to die.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.080 align:middle line:84%
You have less than
a year to live.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very sorry to tell you.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And in this dream, I started
to get very emotional.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, oh, my
god, I'm going to die.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.164 align:middle line:84%
How am I to tell my
parents, my friends?

00:31:41.164 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What am I
dying of, by the way?

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:43.645 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:43.645 --> 00:31:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Oh, they said cancer.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK, you
had cancer, all right.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.545 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yeah, they said
I'm dying of cancer,

00:31:47.545 --> 00:31:49.110 align:middle line:90%
and I have a year to live.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly it popped in
my mind, wait a second,

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.140 align:middle line:90%
my thought forms are not my own.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And right when I said it,
I popped out of my body.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I see myself laying in
bed, and there's a being in bed

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:84%
with me talking in
the back of my head.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
first time that it

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:84%
was a visual experience, where
I'm, like, OK, this is real.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.110 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
manipulate our mind.

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:20.580 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.082 align:middle line:90%
And it made me so angry.

00:32:23.082 --> 00:32:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It's so funny,
because you know you

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.750 align:middle line:84%
have a spiritual experience,
but your emotion is anger.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah, because
you feel it was an intrusion.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.514 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: It's an intrusion.

00:32:31.514 --> 00:32:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So I grabbed this
thing and it started

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:84%
kind of trying to shake and get
away, and I said, who are you?

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.320 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And it started to just
give me gibberish, like,

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:90%
no sense whatsoever.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I said the key words,
are you a being of light?

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why this works.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea why this
works, but it just does.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.470 align:middle line:84%
This being calmed right
down and said, right to me,

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.720 align:middle line:90%
no, I am not.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.615 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found
that fascinating.

00:33:02.615 --> 00:33:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
everyone listening

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:84%
is saying, gee, why
would rat itself

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:09.000 align:middle line:90%
out and say that it was not?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And I said, you
know, get out of here.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.054 align:middle line:84%
Actually, much worse
things, I said to it.

00:33:15.054 --> 00:33:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like your brother.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yeah.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So, the PG version,
I said, please

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:84%
leave, and don't come back
and manipulate me again.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.860 align:middle line:90%
You not allowed back here.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So you spiritually
put your foot down.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:28.020 align:middle line:90%
You cannot manipulate me.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was a couple of
very scary aspects of this.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:36.630 align:middle line:84%
One was that it took
the form of an angel.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:38.830 align:middle line:90%
It looked beautiful.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we
really have to be careful,

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:84%
because these beings, they
can take any form you want.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:49.140 align:middle line:84%
I've had them come to
me as people I know.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.340 align:middle line:90%
They've come to me as my mother.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's all a big manipulation.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to
learn how to feel

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.810 align:middle line:84%
if that is the real being
or something projecting

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:02.580 align:middle line:90%
a false image.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So, it's very hard for people
to play in these worlds,

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.190 align:middle line:90%
because it's very dangerous.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:11.909 align:middle line:84%
And the second scary
thing was, what if I

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.670 align:middle line:90%
believed I was dying of cancer?

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:18.134 align:middle line:84%
Was this being
implanting this program,

00:34:18.134 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and if I took that at that
very deep, subconscious level--

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sure, you fear it,
you think about it every day

00:34:22.925 --> 00:34:24.280 align:middle line:90%
100 times a day.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It will manifest,
because we are manifestors.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And then this being, whatever
it was, it goes, great.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.360 align:middle line:90%
I have a food source now.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.449 align:middle line:84%
I can feed off of
that emotion now.

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:90%
I totally get that.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.949 align:middle line:84%
I've interfaced with that
myself, in the same thing.

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, you are
not a truthful voice,

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.489 align:middle line:90%
and that's not my reality.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.650 align:middle line:84%
But it is very
interesting, the ways

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:84%
in which it can go
into our consciousness.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.679 align:middle line:84%
And this brings
up, to me, a topic

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm very passionate
about, because there

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.060 align:middle line:90%
have to be simple--

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.750 align:middle line:84%
relatively simple
rules of discernment

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:04.740 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to this.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.725 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise we're
down a rabbit hole.

00:35:06.725 --> 00:35:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And you have to say,
well, it's case-by-case,

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.460 align:middle line:90%
but I don't believe that's true.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are certain
types of messages that are

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:90%
simply not from higher realms.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:16.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Oh, yes.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about the type of message

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and quality of messages
that we make here

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.020 align:middle line:84%
in these states that
are absolutely not

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.867 align:middle line:84%
from higher realms, regardless
if it looks like an angel.

00:35:27.867 --> 00:35:29.825 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I don't want to
step on any toes here.

00:35:29.825 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you don't have
to be politically correct,

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.650 align:middle line:90%
just go for it.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: OK.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:39.210 align:middle line:84%
There is something going
on, and it feeds off

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.790 align:middle line:90%
of the egos of people.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ego, absolutely.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And the thing that
I see most of all in this

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:84%
is, let's say, a channeler,
or an experiencer,

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.190 align:middle line:84%
or even a contactee
that says, I'm

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:84%
the only person in the world
to have this information.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wrong.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: You're
wrong and I'm right.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wrong.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Right.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So, I've dealt with this
in the outer worlds,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very big problem,
because our belief systems here

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:21.720 align:middle line:84%
are, we're not strong,
we're less than thou,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and anything outside
of us is better than us

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.576 align:middle line:84%
or higher than us,
which is not the case.

00:36:29.576 --> 00:36:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So, when you leave
your body and you're

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.400 align:middle line:84%
starting to deal with different
entities or beings that even

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:84%
look like angels
or gods, we have

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.720 align:middle line:84%
to come from a place
of empowerment.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.230 align:middle line:84%
We can't come from a place
of, you're higher than us,

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
because once we enter
that, it's a trap.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, now they
can feed off of you,

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:56.070 align:middle line:84%
you're giving your
energy to them,

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're actually
making them stronger.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're more
controllable yourself.

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, you're open
to suggestion and control.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, you leave your
body and a being comes to you,

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.440 align:middle line:90%
I am your god, come with me.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:90%
No, you're not.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:13.460 align:middle line:90%
No, wrong.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And then
they just leave.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But most people have that
belief system that, like I said,

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:84%
anything outside of
us is better than us,

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:84%
and they will drop on
their knees and pray.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy, you could
get me going for hours on that.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Yikes.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.340 align:middle line:84%
It is so true, and it's
so inappropriate, and sad,

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.424 align:middle line:90%
and no longer useful.

00:37:34.424 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: That's right.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.090 align:middle line:90%
So we have to learn.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is why I'm
out speaking publicly, is

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.910 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
one out there that

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.520 align:middle line:90%
has a voice that's neutral.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And the voice that's
neutral is saying,

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can get messages, you
can get channeled information,

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.270 align:middle line:84%
you can get experiences,
visions, taken on journeys,

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:58.620 align:middle line:84%
but we can't lose our
sense of guidance.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Just because we experience
it doesn't make it true.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.060 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Because there is manipulation.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, when
I speak to people,

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:12.039 align:middle line:84%
I only focus on the elements
that have helped me in my life.

00:38:12.039 --> 00:38:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So, the things that
I've learned over there

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:90%
is, you need to heal yourself.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that was the
best line I've ever

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.740 align:middle line:90%
heard on the other side.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And true.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Because they
taught me over there--

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.000 align:middle line:84%
it was almost the
opposite of what's

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.970 align:middle line:84%
being taught now in
the spiritual movement,

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.400 align:middle line:84%
because what they preach
on the other side--

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:90%
it's not preaching.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:38.550 align:middle line:84%
What they tell you on the other
side is self-responsibility,

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.540 align:middle line:84%
you're in control, you have
to take back your energy

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and become whole, and your
spiritual journey is yours.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll say there's a lot of talk
right now of ascension or mass

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.031 align:middle line:90%
awakening or--

00:38:56.031 --> 00:38:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and the most
dangerous thing they

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.210 align:middle line:84%
taught me, the most dangerous
thing they taught me

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:03.120 align:middle line:90%
about this world--

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.710 align:middle line:90%
and I'll just say it--

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:90%
is the savior complex.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.220 align:middle line:84%
They said that is the
single greatest problem

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.650 align:middle line:84%
in our consciousness, is
something outside of us

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:15.030 align:middle line:90%
is going to save us.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a new
word for it now.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.630 align:middle line:90%
It's called interventious--

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:18.713 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interventionism.

00:39:18.713 --> 00:39:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Interventionism.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, we sit back, we
take no responsibility,

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.520 align:middle line:84%
we listen to all the
beautiful things,

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and somebody else is
handling it for us.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
type of program

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that religion has been using
for thousands of years.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:90%
It's just taken another form.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:40.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:46.290 align:middle line:84%
This is very convenient for
lower realms to keep people,

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.030 align:middle line:90%
essentially, passive.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And when
you awaken, I don't

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.417 align:middle line:90%
want to tell people it's fun.

00:39:53.417 --> 00:39:54.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fun thing, to awaken.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it does
require personal responsibility

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and confronting one's
own inner demons.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yeah, that's right.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And because, when
you leave your body,

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.570 align:middle line:84%
you take all your
energy with you.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So, if you're carrying
distortions of consciousness,

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:18.180 align:middle line:84%
you're going to attract the
worst beings towards you.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
say to me, Jason,

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.550 align:middle line:84%
please teach me how
to leave my body.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll say, it's best you don't.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Depending on how you feel
their development is coming.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Right.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Because when you leave, you
become open to these things.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, when I still
had healing to do of my own--

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:84%
we all still have
healing, by the way--

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:84%
but when you would
leave your body,

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.940 align:middle line:90%
you come back with things--

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.510 align:middle line:90%
we call them cling-ons.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.400 align:middle line:90%
You come back with cling-ons.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And so now you wake up and you
have entities connected to you,

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and you feel sick, you're
getting weird thoughts,

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:84%
you feel very strange,
and you realize

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.370 align:middle line:84%
that you left your body with
some type of distortion that

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:11.050 align:middle line:84%
attracted these beings to
you, and you as a human being

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:13.540 align:middle line:90%
are nothing but a doorway.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.770 align:middle line:90%
That's what a human being is.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:17.170 align:middle line:90%
A human being is a doorway.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So, if you open the door,
they're going to come through.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
get these whole ideas

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.230 align:middle line:84%
of demons or possession
or anything like that.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.700 align:middle line:84%
A lot of entities desire
to have this experience

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.597 align:middle line:90%
in this five-sensorial realm.

00:41:32.597 --> 00:41:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, but
we were also talking

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:90%
about these grids earlier.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And you are connected
to these grids,

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and you are a doorway to
these grids and portals,

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:84%
so if, let's say, you
need to help a being pass

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.280 align:middle line:84%
into different
worlds of dimensions,

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:52.030 align:middle line:84%
they can use your energy as
a doorway to these worlds.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I get woken up
in the middle of the night

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:58.060 align:middle line:84%
by someone pulling
on the covers.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:90%
It's just someone that is stuck.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, let's talk
about your own means

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:07.180 align:middle line:84%
of essentially just dismissing
them, telling them to move on,

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.920 align:middle line:90%
and not allowing this to happen.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Because there are a lot of
people who go to bed at night

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.460 align:middle line:84%
having to cast spells
against the dark forces

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.050 align:middle line:84%
coming for them in their dream
time at night and so forth.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.099 align:middle line:84%
And it's very scary
and very real for them.

00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yeah, of course.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about how you
simply stop that activity.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.170 align:middle line:84%
What I was taught, it has
to do with the strength

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.580 align:middle line:90%
of your own energy and mind.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in
a weakened state,

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.530 align:middle line:90%
you can't really do too much.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:39.306 align:middle line:84%
You can cast your
spells, you can do your--

00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chant your words.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Whatever
you want to do.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.390 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with your personal
empowerment of those words,

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.350 align:middle line:90%
and spells, or whatever.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, those entities,
those beings that came to me,

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.680 align:middle line:90%
they were my greatest teachers.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
will say, oh,

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that's when it's really
dark of Jason to say,

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.340 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the truth.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Because these entities, or what
we would consider dark beings,

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.870 align:middle line:84%
they show you what's
wrong with you.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.430 align:middle line:84%
They show you where
you're hurt, they

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.280 align:middle line:84%
show you where your
trauma is, they show you

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.570 align:middle line:90%
what you still carry.

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they show you
where your fears are triggered.

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:21.086 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: That's right.

00:43:21.086 --> 00:43:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So they trigger you to get
energy, but in the same time,

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.090 align:middle line:84%
they're exposing the
thing you need to heal.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand that,
they're like your guides.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.197 align:middle line:84%
They're showing you,
hey, buddy, look,

00:43:34.197 --> 00:43:34.997 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: See?

00:43:34.997 --> 00:43:35.797 align:middle line:90%
I gotcha.

00:43:35.797 --> 00:43:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: I can still get you.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you say to yourself,
OK, well now I know that area,

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I know that issue, I'm going
to heal that and release it.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you heal
it and release it,

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.240 align:middle line:84%
they can't come and
grab you anymore,

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:84%
because they can only grab
you from your woundedness.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.870 align:middle line:84%
They can only trigger you
from what you already hold.

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So the people that actually
push these beings away,

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.595 align:middle line:84%
they say that they just come
back stronger and stronger

00:44:02.595 --> 00:44:04.296 align:middle line:90%
and stronger.

00:44:04.296 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
acknowledge them, say,

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.330 align:middle line:90%
what are you here to teach me?

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: That's correct.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Before-- this took
a long time, OK?

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.940 align:middle line:84%
When it would happen to me,
I would freak out, obviously,

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and try to fight
them and everything.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Now if I wake up in
the middle of the night

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's some dark
being trying to crush me,

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:25.810 align:middle line:84%
instead of pushing
them, I embrace them.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And right when I
embrace them, it's

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:31.630 align:middle line:84%
almost like they
transform instantly

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.210 align:middle line:84%
into the most beautiful
energy, and it's almost

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:37.150 align:middle line:84%
like you have this
enlightening, awakening, just

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:40.300 align:middle line:90%
by the embracing of true love.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about the
entity you mentioned a long

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:44.210 align:middle line:90%
time ago--

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.380 align:middle line:84%
well, way back at the
beginning of the interview--

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.150 align:middle line:84%
that, when you
confronted them and said,

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:52.870 align:middle line:84%
are you of the light
and they said no,

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:55.270 align:middle line:84%
why would an entity admit
that if they're there

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.260 align:middle line:90%
to interfere with you?

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I meant to pick
that thread up earlier.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: You know, I don't know.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.220 align:middle line:90%
The truth is, I don't know.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.040 align:middle line:84%
People have told me
there's a universal law

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.674 align:middle line:84%
that they have to say their
true intentions, which

00:45:09.674 --> 00:45:10.840 align:middle line:90%
is kind of strange because--

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I don't
understand, because there are

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.210 align:middle line:90%
a lot of tricksters among them.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yeah they'll
come as whatever

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.980 align:middle line:84%
they want to manipulate you,
and then they'll say no.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:23.026 align:middle line:84%
So what I believe is
that it's all a setup.

00:45:23.026 --> 00:45:24.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:27.010 align:middle line:84%
There's higher beings trying
to teach or train you,

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to awaken you, and
they're allowing

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:34.640 align:middle line:84%
you to see beyond
of what can happen.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, I take
it as a teaching.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, I've
experienced this, so now I

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.780 align:middle line:84%
know what to do if this happens
again, and I can understand it.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is some type of
spiritual or religious aspect

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:54.430 align:middle line:84%
to it, where they also
have a belief system.

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have-- because
it's not just a human concept,

00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.396 align:middle line:84%
They can think a
certain way, as well.

00:46:02.396 --> 00:46:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems to
me what's logical--

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:84%
purely logical-- is that
we're in this place where

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.310 align:middle line:84%
you can resonate at whatever
frequency you choose

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:14.770 align:middle line:90%
or you're drawn to.

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you have higher fields,
you're going that direction.

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:20.340 align:middle line:84%
If your energy is
depressed or low

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.810 align:middle line:84%
or has become darkened
for some reason,

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:25.060 align:middle line:84%
then you're in resonance
with these other fields.

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.640 align:middle line:84%
They're just trying to
work out their own agendas

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and do what they
do in their realm.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
interfacing with it,

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's giving you
that opportunity for learning.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's just
living their part.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.810 align:middle line:90%
High, low, in between.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And I think, if we
take away our belief system--

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.030 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, when these
beings started to come to me,

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:49.840 align:middle line:84%
the first thing I
thought of was demons.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.430 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I thought
of was alien abductions.

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all--
we already have

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:58.390 align:middle line:90%
these programs in our minds.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And I found that those programs
are not helping the situation,

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:05.380 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So I had to get rid
of, these are demons.

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I had to get rid of, these
are alien abductions.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had to clear
my mind entirely

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.580 align:middle line:84%
so I had no judgment
of the experience.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And instead of fighting it,
I would just go in peace.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:23.997 align:middle line:84%
I would literally calm myself
down and just experience.

00:47:23.997 --> 00:47:26.330 align:middle line:84%
If it was painful, I just
wanted to experience the pain.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.780 align:middle line:84%
If it was loving, I would
just experience the loving.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So, I had no bias of
what was happening,

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I was just experiencing.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I came at
it from that angle,

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:42.160 align:middle line:90%
suddenly everything changes.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Everything changes.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:46.089 align:middle line:84%
Because it's almost like
you're fighting your mind.

00:47:46.089 --> 00:47:47.380 align:middle line:90%
You're just fighting your mind.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So this being will come to you
and it will look like a shadow,

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and you think, oh my
god, a shadow is dark.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:48:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So, you'll fight against
it, and you'll feel fear.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:05.260 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized, it was
my own fear I was fighting.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.150 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to
do with that being.

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.950 align:middle line:90%
And in fact--

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's no place
to land if you didn't already

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.640 align:middle line:90%
have it.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: That's right.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking after years
of this happening.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I did not think of
this until recently.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.840 align:middle line:84%
But once I let go
of this fear, I

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:26.200 align:middle line:84%
realized that that
being, whoever it was--

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and I just believe it's
another aspect of my soul.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.090 align:middle line:90%
That's all I believe it is.

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Once I let go of
that, I realized

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that this being was
just initiating me

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.780 align:middle line:90%
into my multi-dimensional state.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.670 align:middle line:84%
It was just awakening
me, saying, look,

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:48.190 align:middle line:84%
there's something outside of
you and I'm going to show you.

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.360 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.818 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, what
happens when you

00:48:50.818 --> 00:48:53.020 align:middle line:84%
have human beings
disseminating information

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:57.550 align:middle line:84%
that various species are
trying to control us and have

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.970 align:middle line:84%
been controlling us all along,
and et cetera, et cetera.

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you're well
familiar with all of this.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And again, you already
mentioned that other species are

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.430 align:middle line:84%
going to come save us, we
don't have to do anything.

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.820 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you
have that propagated

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:16.580 align:middle line:90%
into a person's field?

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Thank you
for asking that,

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.510 align:middle line:84%
because we really don't
understand what consciousness

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.430 align:middle line:90%
or our reality is.

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.470 align:middle line:90%
We still don't get it.

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, is
that we are creators.

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:31.270 align:middle line:90%
We're part of source.

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we believe
we actually manifest

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.960 align:middle line:90%
in those other dimensions.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So, if we believe in-- let's
say me and you get together

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to say,
let's create this god.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:47.590 align:middle line:90%
We're going to give it a name--

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:50.980 align:middle line:84%
which is very important,
to give it a name--

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.630 align:middle line:84%
visualize it, give it all
its attributes, what it does,

00:49:55.630 --> 00:50:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and then tell people
about this supreme being.

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Once the people start to
believe that this is real,

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:07.120 align:middle line:84%
if it's convincing,
what you're doing is,

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.400 align:middle line:84%
you're getting
people's attention--

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.220 align:middle line:84%
which is energy,
their life force--

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that life force is now
putting together that reality

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.560 align:middle line:90%
in different dimensions.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.484 align:middle line:90%
So we can create--

00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if we
should be saying this,

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:27.280 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- but we
can create these beings,

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and the people will
give it its life.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, is
that it takes your life

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:37.540 align:middle line:90%
to keep it going.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet we have a
number of charismatics

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:47.610 align:middle line:84%
out there telling these stories,
and people go away in fear

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're being controlled--
they're being controlled

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
they can do about it.

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:56.500 align:middle line:84%
When the story goes that
direction, I have to object.

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: But the
human condition,

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:02.300 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of
years with religion,

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.280 align:middle line:84%
the human condition
believes in that.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:10.490 align:middle line:84%
They've been conditioned
to that type of reality.

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So when these new things
come into our existence,

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:19.180 align:middle line:84%
or if someone creates these new
stories, it's very easy for us

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:24.660 align:middle line:84%
to go into resonance with it and
feel that energy of that being.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.902 align:middle line:84%
People will even
start to channel them,

00:51:26.902 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:84%
where they've never
existed before.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.030 align:middle line:84%
People start to get channeled
messages from those beings.

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That don't exist.

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:35.650 align:middle line:84%
That are created beings,
through thought forms,

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:39.970 align:middle line:84%
through energy, sheer energy
and mind power going into them,

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:43.810 align:middle line:84%
just like this wall, this
set, is created through that.

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And what if
every human on this planet

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.920 align:middle line:84%
was born with the
knowledge that they

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.600 align:middle line:90%
have this power of co-creation?

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's why I think
it's so important for various,

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.180 align:middle line:84%
more devious
agendas, to make sure

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:57.370 align:middle line:84%
that we do not wake
up to our capacities.

00:51:57.370 --> 00:51:59.825 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we're
an awesome species.

00:51:59.825 --> 00:52:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Oh, yes.

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And people always ask
me, what's the point?

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Why are these things trying
to steer us in a direction?

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:14.710 align:middle line:84%
It's because they can't
manifest their reality.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our
creative capacities

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:20.140 align:middle line:84%
are so far beyond so many
other dimensions of beings.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: So, in a
sense, we are being

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:26.260 align:middle line:84%
used to create
somebody else's vision.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And that is extremely
important to understand,

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.620 align:middle line:84%
because once we realize that
this reality we're living in

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:37.690 align:middle line:84%
is somebody else's vision,
then we can come together

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:42.610 align:middle line:84%
as a collective and say, how
can we dream a reality, if we

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:43.420 align:middle line:90%
have this power?

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:44.754 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:52:44.754 --> 00:52:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's beautiful.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Well said.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.330 align:middle line:90%
We only have a few minutes left.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.770 align:middle line:84%
We haven't even gotten to
the notion of time and space.

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk a little
bit about parallel timelines

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:58.120 align:middle line:84%
and our being as living
multiple lives simultaneously.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.350 align:middle line:90%
In three or five minutes.

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:01.245 align:middle line:84%
You'll come back and we'll talk
about the rest of the story

00:53:01.245 --> 00:53:01.460 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Oh, sure.

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:06.670 align:middle line:84%
We live in multiple
worlds, multiple universes,

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:08.260 align:middle line:90%
multiple dimensions.

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness is in
those things simultaneously.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And there is separation
of consciousness, which is

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.330 align:middle line:90%
very, very good, by the way--

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:22.030 align:middle line:84%
you do not want bleed-throughs
of these other lives.

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And when we are in
the physical world,

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.980 align:middle line:84%
we can call this
horizontal time,

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.040 align:middle line:84%
we're moving through
time and space.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.490 align:middle line:84%
When you leave your body,
we call this vertical time,

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and we can jump
through time and space.

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And what I personally believe,
after all these years,

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:45.070 align:middle line:84%
is that these higher
beings could actually

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:49.660 align:middle line:84%
insert their consciousness
into any time period

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:54.100 align:middle line:84%
through time and space,
become physical, or incarnate,

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:58.960 align:middle line:84%
in those places, change
something, do something,

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.440 align:middle line:90%
and alter the flow of time.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And then they can leave time
and see how what they did

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:08.650 align:middle line:84%
changed the future, and then can
keep inserting themselves back

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to create some new
form of energy,

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:13.460 align:middle line:90%
or new form of consciousness.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's a continual regeneration
of the consciousness.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like "Back
to the Future".

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.290 align:middle line:90%
The film "Back to the Future."

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.720 align:middle line:84%
changing your own timeline's
reality, potentially.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Oh, yes.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:27.310 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about
multiple universes.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:30.550 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
multiple timelines.

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:35.740 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had
this crazy thing

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:40.925 align:middle line:84%
happen where it's like
I woke up in the future,

00:54:40.925 --> 00:54:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and it was almost like I
was just me in the future.

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
came back here, I

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:49.300 align:middle line:84%
was it was really messing with
my mind trying to figure out,

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.240 align:middle line:90%
am I in the past?

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Did I just come
back in the past,

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.367 align:middle line:84%
or was I in-- are we
living in the future?

00:54:56.367 --> 00:54:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Are we living in the past?

00:54:57.450 --> 00:55:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't distinguish where
we were in these timelines.

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, this has
a lot of implications.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:07.450 align:middle line:84%
But one thing we have to
mention before we finish

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:13.160 align:middle line:84%
is that somewhere, when you were
in another frame of reference,

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.649 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, you were
also given tools.

00:55:15.649 --> 00:55:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Because part of this is, we've
talked about in the beginning,

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:19.330 align:middle line:90%
is about healing.

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And you were given these
beautiful postures,

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and hand positions and postures
that the Egyptians used.

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Talk about it a little
bit, because we're

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:29.810 align:middle line:84%
going to do another
show on that later.

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Of course.

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:35.700 align:middle line:10%
And these beings said to
me, I needed to heal myself.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.040 align:middle line:10%
That was the most important
thing I needed to learn,

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.900 align:middle line:10%
is how to heal myself.

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And I started to be taken
back to Egypt in journeys,

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'd be projected there,
and I'd just be in a temple

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:50.010 align:middle line:84%
with a being standing
in front of me

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:53.130 align:middle line:84%
that looked like the
statues, like a pharaoh,

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and they'd be
holding the posture.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.146 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
conversation, I

00:55:58.146 --> 00:55:59.520 align:middle line:84%
would just stand
in front of them

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and copy whatever
they did, and when

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I did that, this thing
opened up above my head.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like a
waterfall of solar energy

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:11.550 align:middle line:84%
going through my whole
body, and it was so powerful

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:16.260 align:middle line:84%
that when I came back I
would document these trips.

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And eventually it turned
into a whole system.

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to practice
it, it changed my whole life.

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I actually
started in this journey,

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:32.190 align:middle line:84%
is trying to show people what
I learned from these postures.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And I still use them today, I
still teach them everywhere,

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.690 align:middle line:90%
and for me, it feels very good.

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we could talk about
spirituality and consciousness

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:47.310 align:middle line:84%
all the time, but for
me, it's not about that.

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:48.880 align:middle line:90%
It's the physicality.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, the
embodiment of it.

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:52.194 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: You have
to do these things.

00:56:52.194 --> 00:56:53.610 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
spiritual practice

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.340 align:middle line:90%
because you've got to practice.

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So, as I practiced
these postures,

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I could see and notice
profound effects

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:06.780 align:middle line:84%
starting to shift and
happen all around me.

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.505 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk
all about those--

00:57:08.505 --> 00:57:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll do that
in the next conversations,

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.960 align:middle line:84%
but you have written a
book, so we're going to--

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to-- any final,
teeny little thought

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:18.810 align:middle line:84%
that just takes a second or so
that you'd like to give to us?

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.185 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I'll just
say, I've been

00:57:20.185 --> 00:57:25.740 align:middle line:84%
doing this for a long time,
and after all this time,

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.640 align:middle line:84%
the answers are not
the important things.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.110 align:middle line:10%
It's the questions.

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:33.240 align:middle line:10%
And it's the right questions.

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:37.020 align:middle line:10%
And it's the questions that
drive us forward and awaken us.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.070 align:middle line:10%
So, when you receive
an answer, don't stop

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:42.780 align:middle line:10%
because you think you know it.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Because what I
realized is, truth

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:50.160 align:middle line:84%
changes with your
perception of reality.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.840 align:middle line:90%
So keep questioning everything.

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with that 100%.

00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.239 align:middle line:84%
It's been a pleasure,
Jason, and we

00:57:59.239 --> 00:58:01.321 align:middle line:84%
will get into that next
time, but meanwhile, we'll

00:58:01.321 --> 00:58:02.430 align:middle line:90%
talk about your book now.

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again.

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:04.121 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Thank you.

00:58:04.121 --> 00:58:06.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Jason's book is
called "Egyptian Postures

00:58:06.245 --> 00:58:07.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Power".

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.030 align:middle line:84%
He has another one called
"Forbidden Knowledge",

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:10.500 align:middle line:90%
very fascinating, as well.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.810 align:middle line:10%
Both available at major
booksellers, along with a DVD.

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here on Open minds.
