>>REGINA MEREDITH: The
one common understanding

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:10%
of all truly great leaders,
philosophers, and artists

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:10%
was that our societies
are worth nothing

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:10%
without our creative input.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Far beyond a function of
mind, the creative impulse

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:90%
requires openness to source.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And that source,
when unrestricted,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:84%
can create boundless
beauty in this world.

When we look around,
however, it appears

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
we're not seeing this
divine reflection

>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start with
something you said off camera.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.016 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it down.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:84%

explain this to us, all right?

"The more we are
distracted, the more

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:90%
we're denying ourselves love."

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:90%
We are distracted.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Most of us don't feel the
love in our daily lives.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Let me
give you an example.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:10%
Let's say you ask
me that question,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.721 align:middle line:10%
and I'm holding my cell
phone here, and I say, well,

00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:10%
just second, I've got a text .

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:10%
Let me just finish this real
quick, and I'm reading my text,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.752 align:middle line:84%
So how loved do you feel, or how
loved would your audience feel

00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
if I was sort of on my cell
phone, I finished a text,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
put it down, and
then addressed you?

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.447 align:middle line:90%
That's just a gross example.

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hate it.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: But what's
behind it is that inspiration

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
is given to us as the
operative language of creation.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It is the core energy,
the prime directive

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.841 align:middle line:84%
of existence, inspiration
and creativity.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been thinking about
this prior to this interview,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and last night I was thinking
about-- most cultures have

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:90%
called God the creator.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
So look how much importance
we put on creativity

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:90%
in a spiritual sense.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:90%
So where does love fit in?

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, if inspiration
is a state of openness,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
a state of presence,
which is very

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
important to this conversation,
the state of complete awareness

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of being and being completely
absorbed and engrossed

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.887 align:middle line:84%
in our experience where there's
no distraction-- meaning even

00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:31.345 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts aren't
distracting us,

00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:84%
right-- then I think our natural
state is that of being in love,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.700 align:middle line:90%
in the state of love.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That presence.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Presence.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So I equate presence with
love, with inspiration.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.132 align:middle line:84%
So when I have thoughts running,
or when I'm watching something

00:03:48.132 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm speaking to you, and
I'm looking over your shoulder

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.840 align:middle line:84%
because there's a television
screen or something else,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
or I'm thinking about my
day, I'm not loving you.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And with myself, if
I'm running my program

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of things
going on like this,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.783 align:middle line:84%
and I'm reaching for the
phone and going to email,

00:04:03.783 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this, I'm doing that.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not allowing
myself to be loved.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Because when I can fully be
aware of what's coming to me,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:84%
fully be aware of my experience,
no matter what it is,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I am being loved by the universe
by being given pure awareness.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:90%
So there's our connection.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.129 align:middle line:90%
You get that.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I get it.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
reason I wanted

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
to have this
conversation, simply put,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:84%
was, you know, I interview
a lot of amazing people,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people who
bring the kind of science

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
pathway to spirituality
into the conversation,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.770 align:middle line:84%
like Joe Dispenza
and Gregg Braden.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.297 align:middle line:84%
You have performed
alongside Gregg.

00:04:40.297 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I know you guys have
been in dialogue.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:84%
He requests to have your
presence there, and all that.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But when I was thinking
about that, I thought,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, all these men give
these beautiful presentations,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
but we come back
to this place where

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:90%
we have to buy our lives back.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.970 align:middle line:84%
We have to buy
ourselves back somehow.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to take command
of our own reality again.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:90%
But no one says how.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the
greatest factor in this

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.062 align:middle line:84%
is being cut off from our
own source of creativity.

00:05:07.062 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wanted to have
this conversation with you,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.967 align:middle line:84%
because you're the most
creative person I've ever met.

00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every day you're
creating something.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
We did an interview
once years ago,

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.134 align:middle line:84%
and you said, if I don't
create something in a day,

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm dying.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.512 align:middle line:90%
And you create everything.

00:05:20.512 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're
multi-talented, obviously.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.055 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: I'm an
inspiration shark.

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I have to keep moving,
otherwise I can't breathe.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:90%
I have to keep creating.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but let's get to your
family and the background,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:84%
how that happen for
you, because a lot

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.985 align:middle line:84%
of the kids of the parents
watching this right now,

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
they don't know how to
re-inspire their kids.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
They put them in front of the
computer, they have an iPhone,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.515 align:middle line:90%
they have some Xbox.

00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: OK.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.931 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's two things
you just asked me.

00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
One is how do we
get, I call it back

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
to the state of
inspiration and creativity?

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we're given
that when we're young.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:84%
There's some amazing
statistic somewhere--

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.629 align:middle line:84%
what is it about how our
creativity diminishes

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
through time?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yes.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.139 align:middle line:84%
I think you read
the same one I did,

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:84%
which is that up to the age of
five, we still have about 80%

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle line:84%
of our creative potential
available to us.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.005 align:middle line:84%
And by the age of 12, when we
enter school-- kindergarten,

00:06:09.005 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:84%
right?-- it's
diminished down to 2%.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Shocking, by 12.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
By the time we hit
pubescence, which

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:90%
should be wildly creative.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: So can
anyone out there imagine

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that most of us, most of them--
I have to not include myself

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.540 align:middle line:84%
there, really-- are operating
on 2% of our creative potential?

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And I believe our
creative potential

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:90%
is our full potential of being.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.105 align:middle line:90%
That's everything that is.

00:06:33.105 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.896 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: It's like
taking a beautiful plant

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and cutting 98% of the branches
off and the leaves off,

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:90%
and expecting it to survive.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're doing.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So let me address
your first question.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.752 align:middle line:90%
How do we get back?

00:06:48.752 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I want to hear
about your family first.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Oh, the Greek thing.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's fine.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, you're Greek.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:84%
You guys are known for
beauty and all this, so--

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Well, but
the culture, Greece

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
had a history--
Ancient Greece, I mean,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
you could almost say
that they worshipped

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
intellect and the arts.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was the major,
major fueling factor

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.710 align:middle line:90%
of Greek culture.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything was about balance
and beauty and appreciation

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
of beauty and intellect
and ideas and all of this.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.106 align:middle line:84%
Well, handed down genetically
through the millennium--

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
you're Greek Greek.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: I'm
100% Greek, right.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And my grandparents
were all born in Greece.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:84%
But handed down into my
boyhood and into my upbringing,

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
my parents always
encouraged whatever

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:90%
was educational and creative.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:84%
There was no limit on
creativity in my household.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:90%
My mother is a painter.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:90%
She's still with us.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And she still sketches and
draws beautifully at almost 87.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:90%
But that was never stifled.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's the important
thing I want to say.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I just
inherited a certain amount

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
of artistic talent, a genetic
predisposition to creating.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:90%
That's probably the case.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.654 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a soul
imprint, so to speak.

00:07:58.654 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Yeah.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
important is that wasn't

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.080 align:middle line:90%
stifled in my household.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:90%
All of us were encouraged.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
My sister to play classical
piano, my brother, he

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.362 align:middle line:84%
did the most incredible
drawings when he was young.

00:08:11.362 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anything
that was creative.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't do music
when I was quite young,

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.640 align:middle line:84%
but I was an oil painter
at the age of 11.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.306 align:middle line:84%
And I had an exhibition to my
sixth grade class of, like, 12

00:08:23.306 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:84%
oil paintings that
were abstract,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:24.940 align:middle line:90%
all done with a palette knife.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't know that.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:90%
What about the poetry?

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Because your poetry
is so Rumi-esque,

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I kind of get it confused
between you and Rumi.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:90%
When did you start doing poetry?

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: About six.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.092 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, I started writing
little poems at six.

00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:38.300 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what they were.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:84%
They were just
little word things.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:84%
My mother said, you wrote
a poem when you were six.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.714 align:middle line:84%
So the important thing
I'm trying to say here

00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:84%
is that we were encouraged to
always be creative and always

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.554 align:middle line:90%
respect education.

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Those were two things.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about
what Don Miguel Ruiz calls

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:01.300 align:middle line:84%
the domestication of our
humanity type of education.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
It was more whatever inspires
the intellect, whatever

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:84%
great idea's coming,
whatever wisdom

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:90%
we can acquire or tap into.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.739 align:middle line:90%
That kind of education.

00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So can I read a
little quote here?

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Please.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:84%
This is from Edith Hamilton's
work called "The Greek Way."

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I love this quote
because it fits so perfectly

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:90%
with what you just said.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:10%
So it says, "Greek religion
was developed not by priests

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:10%
nor by prophets nor by saints
nor by any set of men who

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.230 align:middle line:10%
were held to be removed from
the ordinary run of life because

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:10%
of a superior
degree of holiness.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:84%
It was developed by poets and
artists and philosophers, all

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:84%
of them people who instinctively
leave thought and imagination

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.261 align:middle line:90%
free."

00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: I love that.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Instinctively.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Key word, right?

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: OK.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And this was the development
of religion, right?

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are references
to-- of Thomas Jefferson

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.756 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality and developing
the premises of our country.

00:09:58.756 --> 00:09:59.506 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:09:59.506 --> 00:10:00.575 align:middle line:90%
One of my heroes.

00:10:00.575 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: OK.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
So I want to read you something.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Right across the
street from my hotel--

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.802 align:middle line:84%
which was the Boulderado this
morning, which was actually

00:10:08.802 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
quite wonderful, so
I don't mind plugging

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.015 align:middle line:84%
this hotel-- was a place
called Rembrandt Yard.

00:10:14.015 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
at Rembrandt Yard

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going, what is this?

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And on the building--
and this is so funny,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not not loving
you by doing this,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually the opposite--
on the building were quotes.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And I found one that
really moved me.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a Picasso quote,
and here's what it says.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
"The defining
function of the artist

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:90%
is to cherish consciousness."

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
The defining function
of the artist

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.475 align:middle line:90%
is to cherish consciousness.

00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is also the
basic spiritual tenet of--yes.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.087 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: I think that's
our saving grace right there.

00:10:48.087 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, but we're
totally cut off from that.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Now we're cut off from that.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And so when we look
at society at large,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:84%
when we look at people around
us, as I said in the opening,

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:05.210 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing primarily
exhaustion, fear, defeatism.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
We've been inundated
to the point where

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:90%
we feel very small and less.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the energy.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:90%
How do you view--

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: What a
great word, energy.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a metaphor
that came to me about energy.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
what's popular now,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to
move our energy source

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:84%
from finite fossil fuel
to almost infinite solar,

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.115 align:middle line:90%
or other sources.

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:32.615 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
that as a metaphor.

00:11:32.615 --> 00:11:35.239 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perpetually plentiful.

00:11:35.239 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: The reason
we're getting tired,

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:84%
exhausted, frustrated,
cut out, alienated,

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff is
because we are tapping

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
into our ego
consciousness for fuel.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be
running our society

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.480 align:middle line:84%
in a way that makes
us feel old and tired

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and all those things
you mentioned.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is an
alternate energy source.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
It's tapping into
our inspiration.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It's tapping into our real
fuel, which is our innocence.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
It's our state of
awareness and presence.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:90%
It's all these things.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.480 align:middle line:90%
It's our creativity.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
If we tap into that, as opposed
to our own self-concept.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here's the
way I look at it.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Our culture, to me,
looks like this.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.600 align:middle line:84%
It looks like we're all
at a Halloween party,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.055 align:middle line:84%
and we're believing that
the person is the costume.

00:12:19.055 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're forgetting
that there's

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:90%
a person behind the costume.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
see ego awareness,

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:90%
is in such a strong illusion.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're forgetting
that there is

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
a pure soul behind
the masks we wear.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:90%
So how do we get back, right?

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
We do what we can to connect
to our innocence, which

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
happens through enthusiasm
and passion and compassion

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.947 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:12:44.947 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And all these--
there's several things

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.144 align:middle line:84%
that I could
probably keep naming.

00:12:48.144 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
any entry point

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.865 align:middle line:84%
that takes us into that,
whatever that may be, right?

00:12:51.865 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Well,
if it brings us

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:84%
into the full awareness of our
experience, which fun does.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Play.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, that
never gets mentioned.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:84%
All these interviews
I do and such, we

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.945 align:middle line:84%
don't talk about the
function of play.

00:13:04.945 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: OK.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:90%
You get a room full of children.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.975 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you put 20
children in a room like this,

00:13:10.975 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and you close them off, and
you don't tell them anything.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.589 align:middle line:84%
You leave him alone and
you watch through a window.

00:13:15.589 --> 00:13:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would guarantee
you, within minutes

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.354 align:middle line:84%
they're going to start figuring
something, some way of playing.

00:13:20.354 --> 00:13:22.270 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be doing
something, laughing,

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:90%
goofing around, tumbling around.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.524 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they'll organize
some funny thing.

00:13:25.524 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
do something fun.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
You put 20 adults
in the same room,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
they're just gonna
start talking.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.851 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After the
awkwardness and silence

00:13:31.851 --> 00:13:34.639 align:middle line:84%
wears off, self-consciousness
and who begins.

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: So here's
the difference.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a full body
experience, right?

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling thing.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:90%
You just have fun.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Adults talk because
it's through the brain.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all very mental.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So adults are functioning
from here on up,

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:90%
and kids are fully functioning.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the
change that we go

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
through from before the
age of five till 12 and on.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:84%
We become domesticated
as beings.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So there is hope, but it's not
where a lot of people put it.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.394 align:middle line:84%
I'm not criticizing
a lot of self-help,

00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:84%
because it's not what
I'm talking about.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about where
our culture puts hope.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And where it puts hope is in
the places of achievement,

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:90%
in attractiveness, in power.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And even self-worth has a
really tricky ego side to it

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:84%
if you don't really understand
which self you're referencing.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Are you referencing
the ego self?

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, the more you
feel your ego is worth,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:90%
the bigger the illusion.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.179 align:middle line:84%
But if you conceive of
yourself as the bigger self,

00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
as the beautiful
consciousness that's

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:84%
coming through you at all
times, well, then self-worth

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:39.804 align:middle line:90%
is infinite.

00:14:39.804 --> 00:14:41.720 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole different
way of looking at it.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and the egoic
self is trapped in this state,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:45.860 align:middle line:90%
and kept trapped.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
trappings of media, society,

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and what is being reflected
back to us, because it's

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:90%
encouraging a state of need.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: And need
promotes the economy,

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
and the economy is the way
the global culture relates

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:90%
to itself.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So our currency as
a global culture

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:90%
is material, also finite.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine--and this is very
Pollyanna of me, I admit--

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
imagine if our currency
were generosity, were love.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Then everyone has the
potential to be rich.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:90%
It's unlimited.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not allocated
to different people.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:90%
It's democratic.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing about
inspiration and creativity.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.820 align:middle line:84%
It's free, it's effortless,
it's fully democratic.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:90%
It evokes passion.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.260 align:middle line:84%
There are so many things
about allowing inspiration

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:90%
and creativity to happen.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to pay for it.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just belong
to certain people.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.015 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it is the most
satisfying and enjoyable--

00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
those are the most satisfying
and enjoyable moments

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, when we're
participating in that.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:90%
And it can be the mundane.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:90%
You can't buy it.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And it is the most
fun and satisfy.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.674 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: There it is.

00:15:58.674 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
There is no mundane when you're
in a state of inspiration.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:90%
You're all there.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter
what you're doing.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.965 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.892 align:middle line:84%
When I do my workshops,
oftentimes people

00:16:07.892 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:84%
will very self-consciously
say, well, I'm

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:90%
not a creative person.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And now I look at them
and I say, I disagree.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:84%
You're creating an
entire universe.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:84%
You're imagining, and
so you're creating

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:84%
in your consciousness
an entire universe.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Of course you're creative.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And look at you.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
You're wearing a beautiful
shirt and you wear your hair

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.015 align:middle line:84%
And no one else looks like
that or talks like that.

00:16:27.015 --> 00:16:30.450 align:middle line:84%
You've created a unique
form of art in who you are.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And so to deny one's creativity
is to deny one's humanity,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:90%
is to deny one's existence.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So even to start opening the
mind to what I just said,

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.627 align:middle line:84%
it starts to melt down all
these judgmental distinctions.

00:16:45.627 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what people are

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:84%
like when they come to your
workshops to begin with.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I would imagine there
is a very big difference

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:84%
between the closed down,
contracted person that walks in

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.320 align:middle line:90%
and the person that walks out.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
state you find people in

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and the biggest obstacles
within their own being

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
to be able to even
step out of anything

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.165 align:middle line:90%
that they would do habitually.

00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: OK.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, often, though not
always, when people come,

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:90%
they're quiet.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.050 align:middle line:84%
They're dressed in their usual
"this is my me costume" kind

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:90%
And it's sweet and charming.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.807 align:middle line:84%
And I have lovely
people in my workshops.

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I have to remind
myself that I'm here

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.474 align:middle line:84%
to represent non-judgment
and love and acceptance

00:17:30.474 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and compassion and all that.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I have an ego
like everyone else.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And put in the wrong situation,
I could become that mask.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:90%
I can become like that.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, in my
workshops, I work for days

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.340 align:middle line:84%
just to cleanse
my consciousness.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.561 align:middle line:84%
So when I receive people, I'm
receiving the namaste in them,

00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:49.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm receiving the god in them.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, this is an
expression of innocence.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes people will
come a little self-conscious,

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:84%
am I going to have
to say anything?

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Do I have to show my art?

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no, this
is not about that.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.620 align:middle line:90%
This is the opposite of that.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
This is about you having
your experience for yourself

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
in your journal, on paper,
if we're going to be writing.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:90%
It's all for you.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.152 align:middle line:84%
No one is going to be confronted
to even get up and speak

00:18:11.152 --> 00:18:12.617 align:middle line:90%
in any way.

00:18:12.617 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So the pressure's off.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.783 align:middle line:84%
First you have to take
all the pressure off.

00:18:15.783 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: That's
the first thing.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing I do
is talk about identity, which

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I just referenced
a little while ago.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the who are we?

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the first step in my
workshops, is who are we.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Because really,
if I don't address

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:84%
who are we, then when I say
the word you or we or I,

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.650 align:middle line:84%
no one knows who
I'm talking about.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.480 align:middle line:84%
They could be thinking
that when I say I,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.082 align:middle line:84%
I'm Chris Spheeris, the
recording artist who's

00:18:39.082 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:84%
this and that, has
these accomplishments,

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
looks like this,
dresses like this.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:84%
That's not who
I'm talking about.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:84%
When I look at I
and I look at you,

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm addressing
the master in you.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Because if the master in me
can address the master in you,

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.980 align:middle line:84%
then we are meeting
at a very beautiful

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and nonjudgmental and inspired
level of consciousness.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.026 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I address
the people in the workshop.

00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
have to identify

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that aspect of all--
both selves, all selves.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: All I have to
do is represent that myself,

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.221 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
we're going to meet.

00:19:09.221 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it kind of brings
people up in resonance to that?

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: If they
want to do that.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
If they-- well, nobody
has to do anything.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But what it does
is it provides--

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.504 align:middle line:84%
it holds space for
that to happen.

00:19:20.504 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Really, it just holds space.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And then often, I just see
so many transformations

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:84%
of people who are
very self-conscious.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:84%
One gentleman said in the
last workshop, he goes,

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:90%
I haven't danced in 20 years.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.493 align:middle line:84%
And this was so
much fun, I'm gonna

00:19:32.493 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:90%
go home and dance more now.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's so sweet.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Because we
do different things,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.388 align:middle line:84%
and they're all fun, and no
one's looking at anybody.

00:19:38.388 --> 00:19:43.045 align:middle line:84%
And it's all this beautiful,
trusting atmosphere, to be,

00:19:43.045 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:90%
just to be free and expressive.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.196 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- we're going back to
the play and the child and that

00:19:47.196 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:90%
sort of thing.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.171 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking of something
I have to bring up here,

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:90%
which is so cool.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So my son Stewart
went his entire life

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
through the Waldorf
School system

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:90%
starting with kindergarten.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And kindergarten in the
Sacramento Waldorf School

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:90%
is heaven on earth.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:84%
You have the Red Rose
and the White Rose rooms.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:84%
These are beautiful handmade
buildings all polished woods,

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.240 align:middle line:84%
beautiful hand-dyed fabrics,
curtains, things floating,

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
little areas of
play where you have

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:90%
a table with sandboxes here.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
little area where you

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.630 align:middle line:84%
can play your little
musical instruments,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
or your little
cooking set over here.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And in the early
years of Waldorf,

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
the kids are all
encouraged to just create.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot
of plays, and they

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:84%
have a little stage where
you get up and pretend

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:90%
this and that.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing is
that during the annual auction

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
each year, one of
the things that

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:84%
goes for the highest amount
of money at the auction

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
is a group of something
like six parents

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:84%
can go back to the White
Rose or Red Rose kindergarten

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:84%
room for a day and live
like those little kids live.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:90%
That always goes first.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's oh my god, oh, you
got the White Rose kindergarten

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what is that
saying about us?

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Everybody
loves to play deep inside.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Everybody loves to feel
love, and everybody

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:90%
loves to be loved.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Everybody loves fun,
everybody loves enthusiasm.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Everybody just loves the
stuff that fuels kids.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.986 align:middle line:90%
We all love it.

00:21:15.986 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's accessible
to everybody.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:90%
So that's the deal.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Most adults think, oh, I was
like that when I was a child.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:84%
But now I have to work
and I have to make money.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:84%
But reality, though
it has its parameters,

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to be that serious.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's not the music
that makes you stop dancing,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:84%
it's that you dance to
whatever music is on.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's the corporate
music that's going on,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that reality, you can
still dance within that.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:90%
You can still be responsible.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big things
is to honor yourself.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.740 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a space, in
a job, in a situation,

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship that you
feel is degrading your spirit,

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:84%
well then, you either need to
work at creatively changing

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:84%
that or get out as fast
as possible, because that

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
is a form of self-abuse if
you're constantly reiterating

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:90%
this self-destructive pattern.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
However, the pressure
valves are like, well,

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:90%
where do I find fun?

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:90%
And how can I track my passion?

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Passion is so important.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Everybody wants passion.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:84%
They always equate that to sex,
and that's just too obvious.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:84%
A passion for living,
a passion for cooking,

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
a passion for having children,
a passion for mopping the floor.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if you become
engaged in anything--

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and this is where the word
mundane starts opening up

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:84%
to everything-- whatever you put
all your attention to, or make

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:90%
it fun--

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.299 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is art, really.

00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: It is art, exactly.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we're all artists.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's also where
we can also find passion

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.079 align:middle line:90%
in the simplest of things.

00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So from there-- and I
mean, it's just beautiful,

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
what you just said--
instead, we start

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
going into this world beginning
with kindergarten, a very

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:84%
linear-- well,
except for Waldorf,

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.624 align:middle line:84%
and I'm bringing this up
for a reason-- in Waldorf,

00:22:57.624 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
until they're about
eight or nine years old,

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:84%
they cut the corners
off the paper.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:90%
They're all rounded.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for it is--
you know what the reason is--

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
to allow for creative
thinking and not

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:84%
create linear thinking too early
in life, because they don't

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:90%
want to shut that process down.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
things you talk about

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:84%
is the difference between this
kind of linear creative force

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:90%
and a quantum creative force.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to take us
into a really magical story

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:90%
in a moment.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you'll first comment on
it to set the context for it.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Love to.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Recently I realized
that I'm living

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.550 align:middle line:90%
in a balance between two worlds.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Not just I--I think we all are.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And because we exist
in these bodies,

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.477 align:middle line:84%
we deal with a certain
amount of finiteness.

00:23:42.477 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:84%
We're here for a certain
amount of time in these bodies.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies move and
age and do all this.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:90%
We eat.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:10%
So much of our
material world, I mean,

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:10%
it's basically finite in the
way we can experience it,

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:10%
so including our lives.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:00.514 align:middle line:10%
However, we also have this
equally as important element.

00:24:00.514 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And I say equal because there's
a balance between the two,

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.304 align:middle line:84%
because we do live
in our bodies.

00:24:04.304 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:84%
We want to honor this reality,
but we also live in a place

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.752 align:middle line:84%
where-- I call it the quantum
field, which is maybe different

00:24:10.752 --> 00:24:12.960 align:middle line:84%
than the way maybe Joe
Dispenza or Gregg talks about,

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not a physicist.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.531 align:middle line:84%
But I look at quantum as,
when you make a quantum leap,

00:24:16.531 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:84%
there's no precedent
for that quantum leap.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.020 align:middle line:84%
It defies the laws
of probability.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Now as an artist and
a creator, I only

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:84%
can speak from my own
experience that whatever

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I create-- whether it's a
song, or whether it's a poem,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.150 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's even sometimes
a photograph or some digital art

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.300 align:middle line:84%
or a film, a short film
that I make-- I really

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.250 align:middle line:90%
don't know where that came from.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's always
beyond those limitations.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.984 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: It's
never predictable.

00:24:41.984 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I could lead
up to it by practicing

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.566 align:middle line:84%
scales and learning
chords and all that.

00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But when I truly open up
to real, pure inspiration

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.699 align:middle line:84%
and let myself just go
and become a vehicle--

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's a really
important concept

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.406 align:middle line:84%
that I don't want to-- I
want to elaborate on that--

00:24:54.406 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and to become a
vehicle of creation,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and just let it go and trust--
another important concept--

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.480 align:middle line:84%
what comes out
surprises me constantly.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So I feel-- and oftentimes
I'll create something that's

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:84%
completely unprecedented
in my field, and I'm like,

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:90%
where did that come from?

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:90%
And I call that a quantum leap.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I call creativity comes
out of the quantum

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
field of endless
possibility, and that

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.651 align:middle line:90%
is the field of miracles also.

00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:20.400 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
in the quantum field,

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:90%
miracles are normal.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that requires
your letting go of yourself.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the big
problem with us, is

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
like we won't let our identity
of what we think is ourself

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
open up, and set it
aside long enough

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to even see-- because people
are so uncomfortable with it--

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.510 align:middle line:84%
to see what kind of magic
might pour through us.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
People have a lot of
fear of just setting

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.736 align:middle line:90%
that notion of self aside.

00:25:44.736 --> 00:25:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Let
me read something

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.000 align:middle line:90%
that came to me this morning.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.416 align:middle line:84%
And I have to read
it because it's

00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:52.010 align:middle line:84%
an interesting comment
on what you just said.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Our egos are created
as a healthy mechanism

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:84%
to keep us from abuse
or self-abuse or pain.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So for awhile, they're
important to be here.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But we've taken
them too seriously,

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and now we believe that we
are our defense mechanism.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.026 align:middle line:84%
So I what I wrote,
which I thought

00:26:05.026 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
was kind of cool--
the ego is constantly

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.605 align:middle line:84%
performing preemptive strikes
on our pure awareness.

00:26:10.605 --> 00:26:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: That's what's going
on-- from what you just said,

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that's what's
going on right now.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
That's taking the costume
for the being behind it.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So in relation to that,
we have the capacity

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:84%
at any time to surrender
into our state of pure being.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And the symptoms
of that surrender,

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:84%
which involves trust that there
is something when we release

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
our egos, are all
those beautiful things.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:90%
You feel peaceful.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:90%
You feel connected.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:90%
You feel love.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:90%
You feel enthusiasm.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:50.110 align:middle line:90%
You feel creative.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:84%
See, the Eastern religions
bring in the whole notion

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:84%
of surrender, whereas
the western religions

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:57.945 align:middle line:90%
can be very punishing.

00:26:57.945 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in
the west, the way

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:84%
we've compensated
for that is by way

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
of either religion--
like OK, it's up to you,

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:90%
please take care of me.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.040 align:middle line:84%
That's our form of surrender
in Christianity, for example.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, God, take care of
the situation, please.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Or meditation, which
people can open up

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.270 align:middle line:84%
for moments of that to their--
and surrender to something,

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.910 align:middle line:84%
for usually just a
few moments, though.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: But there's a link.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:90%
There's an interesting link.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.773 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking about this.

00:27:22.773 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:84%
When someone says, I
give my life over to God.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.940 align:middle line:90%
I give my life over to Jesus.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.440 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the same thing
as saying, when I meditate,

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:84%
something comes
in and takes over.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.870 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like what Eckhart
Tolle would refer to as,

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:84%
whatever he uses-- pure
consciousness, pure awareness,

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:90%
being in the now.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It's really the same thing.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So when someone Is
truly born again,

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:84%
it's also the
beginner's mind, where

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
you're able to constantly
refresh the screen,

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to stay
in that child space.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
beautiful space there is.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's where innocence is.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think most of us-- I won't
make a blanket statement to say

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:84%
all of us-- still have
access to our innocence.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I want to believe that all
of us do, but most of us

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
still have access
to our innocence.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the
most beautiful place.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.764 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
where the joy is.

00:28:08.764 --> 00:28:09.930 align:middle line:90%
That's where all the joy is.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: It's pure being.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.341 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So this whole quantum realm of
something that flows through.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And also-- now we're going to
extend the conversation-- it

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:84%
doesn't just flow
through, but it animates.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about what
happened to you recently,

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:27.640 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
life-altering event for you.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back
to that piece that

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.210 align:middle line:84%
played in the
beginning, "Horepse."

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And take time to tell
the story, and you

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.382 align:middle line:84%
can tell it in as much detail as
you want because it's beautiful

00:28:38.382 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:90%
and it does tie back to that.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Sure.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Let me just say that since
this experience happened,

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.342 align:middle line:84%
I have gone through a quantum
leap in how I'm perceiving

00:28:48.342 --> 00:28:49.800 align:middle line:84%
things and how I'm
processing them.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I can't describe that right now
because it's too new for me,

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
but I will never be the
same after this experience.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.540 align:middle line:84%
What you showed earlier was
a song I played for my father

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:84%
about maybe two or
three months ago.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It's his favorite song.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.860 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Horepse".

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:90%
In Greek, that means dance.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the sort
of the Zorba mentality

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:90%
of living your passion.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's certainly
the example--

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you wrote that?

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: I wrote
the music to it,

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.020 align:middle line:84%
and a Greek lyricist
wrote the lyrics to it.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.385 align:middle line:84%
Certainly the example
of my father-- and he

00:29:18.385 --> 00:29:20.510 align:middle line:84%
has always been exemplary
of enjoying every moment.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We see him
sitting in the audience.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:84%
He's smiling, his little goatee,
watching you as you're playing.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.610 align:middle line:90%
He's so happy to hear it.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.497 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: He's
the most-- he's been

00:29:31.497 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:84%
one of most-- one
of the people that's

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
been the greatest example
of enjoy every minute

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.464 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:29:36.464 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Because you never
know, this could

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:84%
be your first and your last
moment right here, right now.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.308 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he's had a
lot of brushes with death,

00:29:42.308 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:84%
hasn't he, since the
age of, what, 20, 21?

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.736 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Yes.

00:29:44.736 --> 00:29:48.064 align:middle line:84%
He had a plane crash at 19, and
his odds were very, very low

00:29:48.064 --> 00:29:48.980 align:middle line:90%
that he would survive.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:90%
However, he did.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happened.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:90%
I was recently in Greece.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:90%
I came back.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I saw my dad the
day I came back.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:90%
We spent some time together.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.133 align:middle line:84%
We went and bought
groceries together.

00:30:00.133 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And how charming that he would
insist on buying my groceries.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was so
happy to see you.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: It
was very touching.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.581 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want him to, but I
was so touched, I let him.

00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:07.330 align:middle line:90%
I dropped him off.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.070 align:middle line:90%
He looked great.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:90%
At his age, he's 90.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.400 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Some days he's weaker,
some days he's stronger.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.570 align:middle line:84%
He was having a good day,
and I was really happy

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that after a month
he looked so good.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.982 align:middle line:84%
I went to bed, and for
some unknown reason

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I brought my cell
phone up with me.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.410 align:middle line:90%
And really I never do that.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.530 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done that in years.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your cell
phone next to the bed.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: My cell phone,
I put it next to my bed.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, because
I really needed sleep.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:90%
I was completely jet lagged.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And I went to bed.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And at about 3 o'clock in the
morning, 3:15 in the morning,

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:84%
I was semi-awake, my cell
phone started going off.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.398 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it,
it was my dad's cell,

00:30:36.398 --> 00:30:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well, maybe he's
pocket dialing me or something.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think anything of it.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Anyway his wife said, Chris, I'm
at the Sedona Medical Center.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Your father's had a heart
attack and it's really bad.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that at his
age and his state,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:84%
his heart's a little weak,
he was most likely going

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:84%
to be dead, especially
from the tone of her voice.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So in 20 minutes of
driving, I prepared myself

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to not only accept
my father's passing,

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:84%
but to be able to see
him in that state.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And something took
over, something

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:84%
very clear and present,
I have to say, took over.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't shaking, rattling,
crying, screaming.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I was very clear
in the way I drove.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're very
close with your father.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So this could have been a very
emotionally thrashing event.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.390 align:middle line:84%
You guys are almost
like twin souls.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.681 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: In a beautiful way.

00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:90%
You know, not overly enmeshed.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:84%
So I get there, and I'm going to
try to make this story slightly

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:23.990 align:middle line:90%
short, because it could go on.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And the medical tech
says, your father

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.705 align:middle line:90%
had a massive heart attack.

00:31:26.705 --> 00:31:28.070 align:middle line:90%
We've restarted his heart.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:90%
We're working on him right now.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Would you like us to continue?

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And his wife very respectfully
said, Chris, you make the call.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:34.864 align:middle line:90%
And I said no.

00:31:34.864 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't want that.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your dad didn't
want a resuscitate.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.551 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Do not resuscitate.

00:31:38.551 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:90%
That was there.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.180 align:middle line:84%
His wife was too shocked to
even tell the med techs that.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.360 align:middle line:90%
So they said, OK, we'll stop.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So he goes back, comes back,
he goes I'm really sorry.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
come and see him?

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was about
five or 10 minutes,

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, OK,
the show is over.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So we went into the room,
and he was lying down.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.820 align:middle line:84%
His eyes were open, he
was staring into the void.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.442 align:middle line:84%
There was definitely
nobody home.

00:32:02.442 --> 00:32:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The doctor had checked
his pupil several times.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.980 align:middle line:84%
There was no pupil
response at all.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Had they called
the time of death by then?

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Not yet.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.450 align:middle line:84%
He was purple, so
he was cyanotic,

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and obviously had--
whatever they call it,

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.570 align:middle line:84%
there's some word
for it when you're

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.820 align:middle line:84%
deprived of oxygen--
hypoxic or something.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there was no
movement in his chest.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I even checked for a pulse
just because I wanted to.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But I could tell from the
look on his face, he was gone.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was almost as
blue as this shirt.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.010 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sitting there--

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.702 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he wasn't
breathing anymore

00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.290 align:middle line:90%
He hadn't been for a long time.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Oh, no his
chest was this far from me,

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.535 align:middle line:84%
and I as watching it,
and I saw that they

00:32:39.535 --> 00:32:40.630 align:middle line:90%
had put a needle or something.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:84%
There was some blood
there from something.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
They had maybe shot him
with something, adrenaline,

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.304 align:middle line:84%
whatever, to get
the heart going.

00:32:45.304 --> 00:32:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But I was looking
because I really

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.910 align:middle line:84%
wanted to believe
he was still there.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:90%
But he wasn't.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was really obvious to the
feeling of him that it wasn't.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.945 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at
Nancy, his wife,

00:32:54.945 --> 00:32:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking at each
other going, he's finally dead.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.069 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at him
and I'm going, god,

00:32:59.069 --> 00:33:01.940 align:middle line:84%
he even looks
handsome when he dies.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:90%
What could we say?

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:90%
He was gone.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just in shock.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Here's what
was really important

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:90%
about that moment.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:07.870 align:middle line:90%
Two things.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.452 align:middle line:90%
One is, I looked at his neck.

00:33:10.452 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:84%
There was this slight
movement, this sort

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.452 align:middle line:90%
of billowing of something.

00:33:13.452 --> 00:33:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
those muscles move.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.368 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the
doctor and he goes,

00:33:16.368 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
that's called agonal breathing,
and that will disappear.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just a response
you have after you go,

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.600 align:middle line:90%
in maybe 20 minutes.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.587 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm going to
stay here until that stops, OK?

00:33:25.587 --> 00:33:26.670 align:middle line:90%
And he's like really cool.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.712 align:middle line:90%
Stay as long as you want.

00:33:27.712 --> 00:33:29.086 align:middle line:84%
All right, he
says, but I'm going

00:33:29.086 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:90%
to have to call time of death.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you do
what you need to do.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.906 align:middle line:84%
Because we're OK with that,
we're accepting that he's gone.

00:33:33.906 --> 00:33:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So he says, OK,
official time of death,

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and someone's writing on a
clipboard, 4:08 AM because they

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:90%
have to do that legally.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.600 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there holding
his hand, and Nancy, his wife,

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:44.500 align:middle line:90%
is holding his other hand.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the room just
thinking of how surreal,

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make plans,
and what are we going to do.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.661 align:middle line:84%
And she said, here,
take his watch,

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and I've been wearing
it ever since.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.990 align:middle line:90%
And it was one of those moments.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Here's what's important.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I never had a sense of an
individuated soul, really.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.175 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believe
everything's energy.

00:34:01.175 --> 00:34:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe everything is
imbued with God force and life

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.480 align:middle line:84%
force, and that's
really the crux

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.500 align:middle line:84%
of all the stuff
we're talking about.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.870 align:middle line:84%
But I never believed
in an individuated soul

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:90%
leaving the body.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But there was something in
the room that I could feel.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't him.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.130 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a personal energy.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
so rich in the room

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.199 align:middle line:90%
that there was a presence there.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:90%
I've heard of this.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.620 align:middle line:90%
And I was speaking to him.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.239 align:middle line:90%
I said, Dad, I'm OK.

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:27.760 align:middle line:90%
You go.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:90%
Be in peace.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:29.317 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:30.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be all right.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew he would
be concerned about me.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.582 align:middle line:84%
And his wife also
said the same thing.

00:34:33.582 --> 00:34:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Andy, do what you need
to do, blah, blah, blah.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.598 align:middle line:90%
OK

00:34:36.598 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:84%
Let me go to the part where
it gets really interesting.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:40.739 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
have to take it

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.616 align:middle line:84%
back to where
"Horepse" comes in.

00:34:42.616 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Oh, yeah, of course.

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Right, now I guess.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I had my phone with me,
being addicted, of course.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.250 align:middle line:90%
I took a picture of him.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I asked if it was OK with
Nancy, and she said, sure.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.979 align:middle line:84%
Being an artist, I took a
picture my dad's dead face.

00:34:55.979 --> 00:34:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And I took a picture
of me holding his hand

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:59.920 align:middle line:90%
and her holding his other hand.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.520 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason, I have
no idea, it just felt right.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.112 align:middle line:84%
And then I got on YouTube, and
I found the song of "Horepse,"

00:35:06.112 --> 00:35:08.070 align:middle line:84%
me playing it for him,
and I played it for him.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Because he always
asked me, every time he

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.430 align:middle line:84%
came to my concerts, which
is almost all my concerts,

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:13.910 align:middle line:84%
he always wanted
to hear that song.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So I said, here, Dad,
here's your going-out piece.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.660 align:middle line:90%
So I played if for him.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.650 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.616 align:middle line:84%
So about 20 minutes
later-- and we're

00:35:20.616 --> 00:35:22.240 align:middle line:84%
still going through
our stuff, his neck

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.740 align:middle line:84%
is still kind of moving in that
weird way, almost like a frog,

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.680 align:middle line:90%
or a fish with gills.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.810 align:middle line:90%
I saw his Adam's Apple move.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
well, that's weird.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Is that one of those
after-death responses?

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.631 align:middle line:84%
And I'm holding him,
and he's purple,

00:35:38.631 --> 00:35:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and, you know-- and
I brought the nurse

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and I said, nurse, is
the Adam's Apple movement

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.000 align:middle line:90%
part of that thing?

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.560 align:middle line:90%
She goes, not really.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.361 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, will
you watch, please?

00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:50.860 align:middle line:84%
A couple minutes later, a few
minutes later, he moved again,

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:90%
and she said, oh my god.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.976 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what she said.

00:35:54.976 --> 00:35:57.100 align:middle line:84%
She called in the crew,
she says, get back in here.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Bring the monitor.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like in "Grey's Anatomy"
or one of those things.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Slapping on the things,
putting together the wires.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Within seconds, he was
back on the monitor,

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing I
heard was, we have a pulse.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.190 align:middle line:84%
He was legally dead
for 22 minutes.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:15.015 align:middle line:84%
He was actually dead for over
30, because I was in the room.

00:36:15.015 --> 00:36:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
call it for awhile.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that kind
of oxygen deprivation

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:25.950 align:middle line:84%
to the brain, 150% of the time,
means severe brain damage.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.185 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Oh, before
he was even-- before they

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:30.310 align:middle line:84%
took the monitors and
stopped working on his heart,

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:84%
they said less than 1%
chance, if his heart continued

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to beat on its own,
that he would not

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280 align:middle line:90%
be a complete vegetable.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Less than 1% chance.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:43.159 align:middle line:84%
He went another 30 minutes
of being dead beyond that.

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Make a long story short--and I
know that we only have so much

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.699 align:middle line:90%
time in this interview--

00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:49.571 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, this is
so fascinating, so tell.

00:36:49.571 --> 00:36:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Well, my dad,
when they slapped the oxygen

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.030 align:middle line:90%
mask on, started to come to.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And within some unknown
amount of time--

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.380 align:middle line:84%
because I was in a
dream at that point--

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.650 align:middle line:84%
he actually squeezed
the nurse's hand when

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.320 align:middle line:90%
she said, can you hear me?

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.319 align:middle line:84%
And finally they just
said, prepare an ICU room

00:37:06.319 --> 00:37:08.110 align:middle line:84%
at the hospital, which
was 20 minutes away.

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:90%
I thought, well, this is good.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.560 align:middle line:90%
He's alive.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And we know he was
in there, right?

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.220 align:middle line:90%
His eyes had closed.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.360 align:middle line:90%
He came back in.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I no longer felt the presence
in the room, which was bizarre.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:90%
He was--

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Back in the body.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: His life
force was sucked back in.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And on the way to
the hospital there

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.597 align:middle line:84%
was the most beautiful,
beautiful rainbow.

00:37:26.597 --> 00:37:27.430 align:middle line:90%
Came out of nowhere.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:28.790 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't even raining.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:30.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there were clouds.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I said to his wife, I said,
Nancy, either he's gone

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and sending us a rainbow,
or something really amazing

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:84%
is in the process of
happening, which it was anyway.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:40.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.696 align:middle line:84%
Here's where I'll
fast forward a little.

00:37:41.696 --> 00:37:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell the story
in writing somewhere

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.810 align:middle line:90%
on a website one day.

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Beyond any expectation of
the cardiologist, anyone,

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:55.280 align:middle line:84%
all the doctors and everything,
my dad in five days recovered.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.840 align:middle line:84%
In the first 24 hours, he was
able to speak Greek and English

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.600 align:middle line:90%
to his friend on the phone.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.330 align:middle line:84%
He has zero loss of
any cognitive function.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:84%
His body's a little weak from
laying in a hospital for five

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.740 align:middle line:84%
days and being at a rehab center
another four or five days.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.198 align:middle line:84%
But in a few days,
they're actually

00:38:11.198 --> 00:38:14.360 align:middle line:84%
going to release him from
the rehab center to go home.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's really--
this is, again, the quantum

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.700 align:middle line:84%
reality animating us
for whatever reason.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And maybe his love
for you, and we

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.770 align:middle line:90%
can talk about that in a moment.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But after I heard this
story, I called my sister,

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:32.059 align:middle line:84%
who's worked in cardiology her--
basically entire adult life.

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And so she's been through
thousands and thousands

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:90%
of cases and seen all of it.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.067 align:middle line:90%
And I told her that story.

00:38:38.067 --> 00:38:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do you think
could have happened there?

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.440 align:middle line:90%
She said, no.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
She said, I've never seen it
happen in all these years.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:48.940 align:middle line:84%
She said one time, after they'd
been working for 20 minutes

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.890 align:middle line:84%
to revive a woman,
she came back,

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.180 align:middle line:84%
but then she died
right away after that,

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.790 align:middle line:90%
within 24 hours in fact.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But she has never heard
of a person coming

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.840 align:middle line:84%
from that state of affairs
back to full consciousness,

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and then continue to live.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's now over
in the category

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:08.020 align:middle line:84%
of the power of what
that soul force can do.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you talked about
the quality-- off camera,

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.630 align:middle line:84%
again-- of that soul
force, it was interesting,

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't your
dad's personality.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: But it was
so apparent and palpable.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.100 align:middle line:90%
And I have to say something.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I was not a witness
to a miracle.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.120 align:middle line:90%
I was part of that miracle.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I believe
that you were, yes.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: And so was his wife.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:90%
We were holding onto him.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.920 align:middle line:90%
We were feeling his life force.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.420 align:middle line:84%
We were not asking
him to come back.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.600 align:middle line:90%
That was very important.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.020 align:middle line:90%
I had no coercion, nor did she.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.120 align:middle line:90%
But I have to say this.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.402 align:middle line:84%
It's been about 10 days
now, and I am radically

00:39:38.402 --> 00:39:39.610 align:middle line:90%
changed from that experience.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:41.319 align:middle line:84%
I said it earlier,
but I'll say it again.

00:39:41.319 --> 00:39:42.776 align:middle line:84%
I don't see things
in the same way.

00:39:42.776 --> 00:39:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel things
in the same way.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
it's still early on.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.032 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
kind of, maybe, way

00:39:49.032 --> 00:39:51.532 align:middle line:84%
to share a feeling that you
have that's changed within that,

00:39:51.532 --> 00:39:54.029 align:middle line:90%
if you can't explain it exactly?

00:39:54.029 --> 00:39:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: I mean, this soft,
mushy, connected cloud of love

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.979 align:middle line:84%
that I-- I mean, for
example, and this is-- I'll

00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:00.020 align:middle line:90%
just give you an example.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I was at the airport
the other day,

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.150 align:middle line:84%
getting in line when
we were flying here.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.715 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- Southwest
Airlines lines everybody up.

00:40:05.715 --> 00:40:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was rather tedious,
even though I understand

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.048 align:middle line:90%
how it works for the airline.

00:40:09.048 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:90%
The airline was great.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But normally I would kind
of go into my grumpy face,

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.162 align:middle line:84%
and I would look around, and I'd
feel alienation and how people

00:40:17.162 --> 00:40:18.745 align:middle line:84%
are this and that
and I don't connect.

00:40:18.745 --> 00:40:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ego.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:20.509 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Yeah,
my ego would be up

00:40:20.509 --> 00:40:21.974 align:middle line:84%
because I'd be
grumpy and cranky.

00:40:21.974 --> 00:40:23.390 align:middle line:84%
For some unknown
reason, what came

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.450 align:middle line:84%
to me is, every single
person I looked at,

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.356 align:middle line:84%
I decided to
project love to them

00:40:28.356 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:84%
in the same way I
projected love to my father

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:middle line:90%
while he was healing.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Came out of nowhere.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And it made the experience
of being there so beautiful.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I could have wait in
line for three hours.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.074 align:middle line:90%
It changed the entire texture.

00:40:39.074 --> 00:40:41.115 align:middle line:84%
The other day in the coffee
shop here in Boulder,

00:40:41.115 --> 00:40:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I was walking by tables winding
my way back to the restroom,

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel
people's energy,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.529 align:middle line:90%
almost like in the sixth sense.

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Now that could be a
temporary state of heightened

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.153 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, but
I prefer to believe

00:40:52.153 --> 00:40:53.250 align:middle line:90%
that I'll never go back.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Because these are things
that-- this experience I had,

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's important
for us to share it--

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.410 align:middle line:84%
these are things
that people talk

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.839 align:middle line:84%
about that seem to be allocated
to the privileged few.

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:04.880 align:middle line:90%
But I don't believe that.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.030 align:middle line:90%
We are all privy to miracles.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.900 align:middle line:84%
We just have to open ourselves
up and allow them to happen.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's really--
really, we're

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.770 align:middle line:84%
balancing the quantum
and the linear.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Here in our culture, we're
way up on the linear and way

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.460 align:middle line:90%
down the quantum.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.860 align:middle line:84%
We're so convinced that we're
stuck in this world that

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is so finite and Newtonian,
and we're all just

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.230 align:middle line:90%
bouncing off each other.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.010 align:middle line:90%
Where is this place?

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.720 align:middle line:84%
In some sort of New
Age pond of silliness

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:84%
that most linear
people criticize?

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When that is
the highest reality.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.285 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: But this
is real, and there's

00:41:35.285 --> 00:41:37.569 align:middle line:84%
a reason why people talk
about spiritual things

00:41:37.569 --> 00:41:39.110 align:middle line:84%
in a sincere and
honest and open way.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about that.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the mystic
and the artist--

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:44.820 align:middle line:84%
like that Greek passage
at the beginning--

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.010 align:middle line:90%
they're on the same frequency.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.725 align:middle line:84%
They're operating off
the same frequency.

00:41:48.725 --> 00:41:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: I can only
say from my experience

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.520 align:middle line:84%
that my spiritual process
has been through creativity.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So I can say that
I connect to what

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.730 align:middle line:84%
is my God through the
process of creativity.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And the process entails giving
up my ego presence to something

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that I trust is greater than me,
which is proving over and over

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.760 align:middle line:90%
and over again to be true.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So the more I have experience
in it, the more I trust.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.470 align:middle line:84%
The more I trust, the
more I surrender to,

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:15.970 align:middle line:84%
in my greatest
moments, and truly

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:19.430 align:middle line:84%
my only moments of pure
presence, I am not here at all,

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:23.300 align:middle line:84%
me as this mask,
person, body, costume.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.570 align:middle line:90%
But I'm really here.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
authentic moments.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I work to impart,

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.079 align:middle line:84%
even if it's for a few
moments, in my workshops.

00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.078 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that, because now,

00:42:34.078 --> 00:42:36.770 align:middle line:84%
instead of going to
listen to someone lecture

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:41.110 align:middle line:84%
on what consciousness,
awareness, and spirituality,

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:45.896 align:middle line:84%
spiritual presence is, let's say
you're taking our viewers now

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.020 align:middle line:90%
on a journey the other way.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.395 align:middle line:84%
Because wouldn't
it be a lot more

00:42:48.395 --> 00:42:50.970 align:middle line:84%
fun to find that
aspect of ourselves

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:84%
through creating
something, through art?

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Well,
I'll tell you what.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:43:00.000 align:middle line:84%
On camera here, in a minute,
I can suggest one exercise,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.285 align:middle line:84%
one simple exercise,
that if done properly--

00:43:03.285 --> 00:43:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean
you follow the rules,

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.150 align:middle line:84%
it means you just
do it according

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.745 align:middle line:84%
to the way I describe-- and
this is not my own exercise,

00:43:09.745 --> 00:43:12.990 align:middle line:84%
this used to be very
common-- all you have to do

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:17.190 align:middle line:84%
is get a few sheets of clean
paper and a pen or a pencil.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And for any given
amount of time,

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.770 align:middle line:84%
five minutes, 10
minutes, 15 minutes,

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:84%
just write down your
thoughts as they come to you

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.304 align:middle line:84%
without stopping, even
if they're nonsense,

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:28.970 align:middle line:84%
even if they're
completely disconnected.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Write down every single thing
that comes into your head.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Just keep writing
and don't stop.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:37.019 align:middle line:90%
Madly dictate, constantly.

00:43:37.019 --> 00:43:38.310 align:middle line:90%
And I use this in my workshops.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.684 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
see a transition

00:43:39.684 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that starts happening
midway through?

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Sometimes people's
need to order things happens.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a natural order
comes in for people.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:51.525 align:middle line:84%
As a creator, this is
called automatic writing.

00:43:51.525 --> 00:43:53.990 align:middle line:90%
I automatically create.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just show up and
put my hands on the piano,

00:43:56.590 --> 00:44:00.230 align:middle line:84%
because the premise is, it
doesn't have to be anything.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And once we start trying to
force it to be something,

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.204 align:middle line:90%
it stops the flow.

00:44:04.204 --> 00:44:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I've done automatic
writing, even in my workshops.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I feel
my brain wanting

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to go even one millisecond ahead
of me, and rhyme cute, do this.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:13.330 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Stay present right now
and keep dictating.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Go so fast that you can't
even imagine what's coming.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anyone can do that.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.921 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Anyone can
do what I just said,

00:44:21.921 --> 00:44:24.182 align:middle line:84%
but now that's not just
an exercise for opening up

00:44:24.182 --> 00:44:24.760 align:middle line:90%
creativity.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:84%
That is an exercise for
practicing presence.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Now live it.

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.824 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is an
exercising for accessing you.

00:44:30.824 --> 00:44:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Yes.

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Because every moment,
we have that channel

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.430 align:middle line:84%
of awareness available
to us, which is also

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:40.470 align:middle line:84%
our instinct and our
intuition and our creativity,

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and I call it also our love,
pouring in constantly, nonstop.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.030 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is quiet
down in whatever way,

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:51.030 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a
frantic quiet down.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:84%
When I get crazy on the piano
and I lose consciousness

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:57.240 align:middle line:84%
of my linear, that's like
the most meditative thing

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I do sometimes.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.990 align:middle line:84%
When I'm madly, crazily
framing a photograph or editing

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:05.780 align:middle line:84%
a short film, when I am so
crazy, I'm drinking coffee,

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going nuts, I'm
going 100 miles an hour.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:09.820 align:middle line:90%
But that ego presence is gone.

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.260 align:middle line:90%
I am just moving that energy.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Or, in the more Eastern sense,
becoming really, really,

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:17.490 align:middle line:84%
really still and really
quiet, where you just

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:18.795 align:middle line:90%
focus on every detail.

00:45:18.795 --> 00:45:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just
whatever's flowing

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.465 align:middle line:90%
through is flowing through.

00:45:21.465 --> 00:45:22.673 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: To honor feeling.

00:45:22.673 --> 00:45:23.720 align:middle line:90%
And here's the big thing.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It's what a lot of
people say is a movement

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:29.780 align:middle line:84%
from a thought-based paradigm
to a feeling-based paradigm.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It's moving from the
head to the heart.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.993 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people talk about that.

00:45:32.993 --> 00:45:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Greg talks about that a lot.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
feelings are non-linear.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:84%
They're really kind
of non-predictable.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And they involve our organism
in a much bigger way.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're not prone
to interpretation.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are always
interpretations of things.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.194 align:middle line:84%
Like thoughts, like
interpretations.

00:45:54.194 --> 00:45:55.110 align:middle line:90%
What did I experience?

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.780 align:middle line:84%
The minute you start describing
what you're experiencing

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.785 align:middle line:84%
or had experienced, you're
already in the past.

00:45:59.785 --> 00:46:01.910 align:middle line:84%
You're interpreting something
that happened before.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:04.030 align:middle line:84%
To be fully present,
there is no thought.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the feeling
is in the moment, which

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:06.841 align:middle line:90%
is different than the emotions.

00:46:06.841 --> 00:46:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And we need to make
that delineation.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:09.485 align:middle line:90%
That feeling of life.

00:46:09.485 --> 00:46:11.568 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Well, I feel
really present right now.

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you I can
describe an emotion.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:16.390 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you I feel
inspired and enthused,

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:20.527 align:middle line:84%
and I'm excited,
and can you tell?

00:46:20.527 --> 00:46:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:21.930 align:middle line:90%
You're shining.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.888 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Well, when
I talk about this stuff,

00:46:23.888 --> 00:46:25.820 align:middle line:90%
it just starts pouring in.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
childlike enthusiasm,

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that's something
that your dad also

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.880 align:middle line:84%
imparted to you is
never-- in fact,

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:84%
he told you something
about enthusiasm.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: He, for
many years, said,

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.180 align:middle line:84%
as you get older the one
thing you should never lose

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.010 align:middle line:90%
is your enthusiasm.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:41.676 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny that
you remembered that,

00:46:41.676 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:84%
because it's a beautiful
piece of advice.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Enthusiasm.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Everyone says it.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.660 align:middle line:84%
They tell you what
the definition.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.050 align:middle line:90%
It means having God within you.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And this is the ancient Greek.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you have God in you,
you are being your existence.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.530 align:middle line:84%
You are fulfilling
your purpose here.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
even know what it is.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.924 align:middle line:84%
When you're enthused, when
you're playing, when you're

00:47:01.924 --> 00:47:03.590 align:middle line:84%
having fun, when
you're inspired,

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:06.302 align:middle line:84%
your purpose reveals
itself in every moment.

00:47:06.302 --> 00:47:08.010 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting here
trying to figure out--

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I did it for decades--
what's my life about?

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:11.740 align:middle line:90%
What's the meaning of all this?

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Meaning and purpose can
be really different.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I am constantly
driven into my purpose

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and meandering through it
by honoring my genuine self.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk for a moment

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.950 align:middle line:84%
before we say goodbye, let's
talk about your workshops,

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and kind of how that
flows, and what people do,

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.240 align:middle line:90%
and why they come.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: OK.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:31.550 align:middle line:10%
Well, and I hope to
have something online

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.320 align:middle line:10%
when this airs.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.300 align:middle line:10%
And check it out on my website.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.347 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.347 --> 00:47:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm really different
from most people,

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:42.575 align:middle line:84%
because every workshop is
exactly where I've come to.

00:47:42.575 --> 00:47:44.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't do a beginners,
intermediate, and advanced.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:45.575 align:middle line:90%
They're all advanced.

00:47:45.575 --> 00:47:47.430 align:middle line:90%
But they're also really simple.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:48.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't use big language.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't try to make people
get it really in their heads.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Just the opposite.

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I try to address things
in a very simple way.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever we do, we
always have an opportunity

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.620 align:middle line:84%
to do things that are
free without expectation.

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.676 align:middle line:84%
So whether we're
automatic writing,

00:48:04.676 --> 00:48:06.300 align:middle line:84%
whether we're doing
a movement exercise

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.716 align:middle line:84%
where we put-- I put sort of
some non-linear music on that

00:48:08.716 --> 00:48:10.300 align:middle line:84%
changes beats, so
that people don't

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.720 align:middle line:84%
get into the trance kind of
groove which is their default.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Because this is a metaphor.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.640 align:middle line:84%
When you constantly
have to respond

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.660 align:middle line:84%
to music that is
constantly changing,

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.720 align:middle line:84%
that is a great
exercise for becoming

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.930 align:middle line:84%
present with this,
which life is music.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.180 align:middle line:84%
All this input, no matter
what you do, when you do it,

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.030 align:middle line:90%
it's just music.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And as you improvise to it,
you dance through it all.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's a metaphor.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So whether we're doing
movement or whether we're

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.180 align:middle line:84%
doing watercolors, which
is basically just basically

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.470 align:middle line:84%
slapping on paint to rhythms
and things like that,

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.030 align:middle line:90%
it's all free play.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:42.640 align:middle line:84%
We do some stuff where we
blow paint around, which

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.950 align:middle line:84%
was taught to me by one
of my favorite people.

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's also an
unwinding of the cognitive,

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.550 align:middle line:90%
of the mental structures.

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:54.490 align:middle line:90%
So I do talk quite a bit.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And each of my lecture
things are based on ideas

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:02.090 align:middle line:84%
that we have presumed are
true, and they're like walls.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And through whatever
I share, I want

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.450 align:middle line:84%
to show people that it
is possible to crack

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that cognitive wall
that we're stuck in,

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.530 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't necessarily
look like that, at least

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.390 align:middle line:90%
from one person's point of view.

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:21.551 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is people
tend to relax their being.

00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So if they're all wound up
from their job and their family

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and this-- I like to
do three days at least,

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:31.950 align:middle line:84%
three days when nobody has
to work or worry about it.

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:34.030 align:middle line:90%
They have no responsibilities.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Just show up and be here, and
provide examples of presence.

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we go hiking.

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And what's funny
in the hike, people

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.820 align:middle line:90%
are always wanting to get there.

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I took a three-mile hike today,
and it only took me an hour.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
there thinking, I'd

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.840 align:middle line:84%
like to take a three-foot
hike and have it take an hour.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.890 align:middle line:90%
To be in full presence, right?

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:56.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that.

00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But to say, it's not
about where we end up;

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:04.240 align:middle line:84%
it's about feeling every moment
and every step of what's around

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.860 align:middle line:84%
us and how beautiful
is in nature

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and the quality of the air and
the sensation of the warmth

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.050 align:middle line:84%
on your skin and feeling
your feet hit the ground.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:12.110 align:middle line:90%
It's all about that.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:13.866 align:middle line:84%
So we do consciousness
presence exercises.

00:50:13.866 --> 00:50:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds like
it's like going back

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.012 align:middle line:90%
to Waldorf kindergarten.

00:50:17.012 --> 00:50:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SPHEERIS: Cool.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.260 align:middle line:90%
We're in the red petal room.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the Red Rose room.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And on that subject of kids,
it was in the Nixon years

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that the-- well, that
the budgets started

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:34.010 align:middle line:84%
being nixed for all the
creative pursuits, music and art

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:37.240 align:middle line:84%
in the public schools,
which is absolutely

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.380 align:middle line:84%
had a devastating consequence
on society and the younger

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.780 align:middle line:84%
generations, as
far as I can see.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.140 align:middle line:84%
There's still some
creativity that's popping up,

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:50.510 align:middle line:84%
but the average kid is not
encouraged in that way anymore.

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: I was shocked when
my sister, who's a substitute

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:58.220 align:middle line:84%
teacher, told me that kids only
have art class once a week.

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.160 align:middle line:90%
We used to get it every day.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.340 align:middle line:84%
But they only have
gym once a week,

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Phy Ed, whatever you call
it, a lot of public schools.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, wow, the arts.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.890 align:middle line:84%
We had singing class,
we had drawing class.

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And I went to a public school.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.681 align:middle line:84%
I went to a very average,
middle-class, beautiful school,

00:51:14.681 --> 00:51:15.180 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me, too.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Art, music, instruments.

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: And that's
all being, like, leached

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:21.470 align:middle line:90%
out of our culture.

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't do
it with children,

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.450 align:middle line:84%
where are they going
to go with that?

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:28.260 align:middle line:84%
In your most open and fertile
time, where you can pick up

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and you can expand exponentially
your creativity-- all

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden they're
not even exposed to it.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you become
a compliant species.

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Doing
this, you know,

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and becoming addicted to very
conformist kind of things.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Now there is hope.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.160 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of
creative apps for kids,

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:45.550 align:middle line:90%
and I've seen some of them.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:45.820 align:middle line:90%
So even--

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
they'll find a way.

00:51:47.195 --> 00:51:48.120 align:middle line:90%
They'll find a way.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But the point is it's
not being encouraged,

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:53.070 align:middle line:84%
so fewer people are having
access on an encouragement

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:53.570 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:55.110 align:middle line:84%
If it's not happening
in the home--

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's what you're
saying, if it's not happening

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.760 align:middle line:84%
in the home, like it did
for you, and even for me

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.510 align:middle line:84%
as a child, I was
always drawing,

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:03.880 align:middle line:84%
playing the piano,
dancing and all that.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.160 align:middle line:84%
If that's not happening,
then they just

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.090 align:middle line:84%
are going to be left
to their own devices,

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:10.410 align:middle line:84%
literally, to find
their way to it.

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:12.970 align:middle line:10%
>>SPHEERIS: Most people use
the computer or the television

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:14.140 align:middle line:10%
as a babysitting device.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.820 align:middle line:10%
Now I have to
defend that, though,

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.340 align:middle line:10%
because we're in
economic conditions that

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.470 align:middle line:10%
weren't the same as when I was
being raised in the '60s, where

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.390 align:middle line:10%
my mother could stay home.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Usually the wife stayed
home with the kids.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.030 align:middle line:84%
There weren't a lot of
career moms, percentage-wise,

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.613 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to have
two-career parents

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.760 align:middle line:90%
because we can't afford it.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So what are we gonna
do with our kids?

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:36.095 align:middle line:90%
I'm a traditionalist.

00:52:36.095 --> 00:52:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Even though I don't have
kids, I love to see,

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:41.050 align:middle line:84%
like, the guy goes to work--
I'm not a chauvinist at all,

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:42.402 align:middle line:90%
but sometimes there's a balance.

00:52:42.402 --> 00:52:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't say that every woman
should stay in the home.

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not like that at all.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
don't have to qualify it.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.031 align:middle line:84%
>>SPHEERIS: Well,
I don't want people

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:49.260 align:middle line:90%
getting all weird about it.

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.530 align:middle line:84%
But I love the balance, for me
personally, of being the guy.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And I want to be the provider.

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And if my partner loves to
be at home and whatever,

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:59.864 align:middle line:84%
and if we had kids, that
would be a perfect balance.

00:52:59.864 --> 00:53:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Keep the mother at home with
the kids as much as possible.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Or find a sister, or a nanny,
whatever, that's really

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:06.890 align:middle line:84%
open and creative and
loving, so the kids can

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:10.010 align:middle line:84%
play in that extended period
where play doesn't just

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.180 align:middle line:84%
start to diminish into some
electronic, hypnotic thing

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.470 align:middle line:84%
that basically puts your mind
to sleep rather than awakens it

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:17.320 align:middle line:90%
creatively.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Because that creates
a compliant species.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
allows larger systems

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.300 align:middle line:90%
to take advantage of us.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And in that, I think we've
just set up something

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.950 align:middle line:90%
that I would like you to read.

that preceded it.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.304 align:middle line:90%
And this is a beautiful quote.

00:53:46.304 --> 00:53:47.720 align:middle line:84%

to go out on that.

to have you read this.

This is from a speech he
did at Amherst College.

So we're going to
go out on that,

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to listen to
you play the music underneath,

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.627 align:middle line:84%
or see you playing
as well underneath.

Really, thank you.
