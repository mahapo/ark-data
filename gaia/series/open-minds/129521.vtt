>>REGINA MEREDITH: "Disclosure"
is one of the most highly

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.500 align:middle line:10%
charged words in our community.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:10%
Is it going to happen or not?

If we're waiting for
people in high places

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to admit that humanity has had
encounters with UFOs and ETs,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I would argue it's
already occurred.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Paul Hellyer is perhaps the
highest ranking public official

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
to speak openly
about the subject,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
as the former Canadian
Minister of Defense.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with him in Los Angeles
about his lifelong efforts

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
at informing governments
and citizens alike

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:90%
about alien encounters.

Paul, I'm so happy we
finally had a chance

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:90%
to catch up to you.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:84%
We thought of flying to Canada
to find you once upon a time,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and years ago, I was trying to
hunt you down somewhere else.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we're
in the same room.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.990 align:middle line:90%
And I feel very--

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL HELLYER: At
the same time, yes.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I feel very
honored to be with you.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.794 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to our mutual
friend Paula Harris--

00:01:12.794 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --who was
able to put us together.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: She is
a great gal, Paula.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you bet.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: One of the best.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.274 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous researcher as well.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:90%
And she keeps things honest.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going
to do about this subject,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
because you've had a wonderful
life of public service.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to that, people
who complain about people

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
in public service
say, ugh, what do they

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.332 align:middle line:90%
know about the world at large?

00:01:35.332 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:90%
They've never run a business.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
They have never done this
and that and vice versa.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But you've done the whole gamut,
and spent a lifetime at it.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Youngest person-- youngest
person in House of Commons

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:90%
at the time?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: At the time,
yes, when I was first

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.810 align:middle line:90%
elected in 1949.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:90%
That's a long time ago.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.476 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Long time ago.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, you were a kid.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:90%
You were in your 20s.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: 25, yes.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:10%
And then still the
youngest-- when

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:10%
I was appointed to the cabinet
eight years later in Louis St.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:10%
Laurent's cabinet.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.289 align:middle line:10%
I'm the only surviving
member of the government,

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:10%
so that's the reason
I'm the Senior Privy

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:10%
Councillor for Canada.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was an honor to serve
with him, even briefly.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's amazing
is just the sheer amount,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.884 align:middle line:84%
through your experience,
of history you've had,

00:02:17.884 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:84%
including the history that
we're going to be talking about

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that, to me, it seems
ludicrous we're even having

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
these conversations
still-- like gee,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't this be disclosed.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we're 10 or
15, 20, years, should be,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:90%
past that debate.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.667 align:middle line:84%
But we're still in
the midst of it.

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: At least.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:90%
At least.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At least.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And especially considering a
document Paula passed onto me

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that was authored by Einstein
and Oppenheimer saying,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're already aware
that we're being visited.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And now we need to look at
strategies as to how we engage.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:90%
That was 1947.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.979 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And we haven't
done anything about it

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
yet, officially or
legally or whatever.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.055 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about legally.

00:02:57.055 --> 00:02:59.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk about
your personal journey in this.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you were Canadians'
National Defense Minister,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:84%
you weren't so aware of
that phenomenon at the time.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: No, I was not.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:90%
This was a long time ago.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What years are
we talking about now?

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: 1963 to '67.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.152 align:middle line:84%
So talk about what you
were peripherally aware of.

00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, I
got a sighting report.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So that was about as close as
I got to the UFO phenomenon

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:90%
These came on my desk.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And they merely told me that
about 80% of all the sightings

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.455 align:middle line:84%
were natural phenomena
and the others weren't.

00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And they were marked
unexplained, which, in a sense,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.827 align:middle line:84%
is unidentified flying objects,
because they were flying

00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:44.660 align:middle line:84%
objects and they didn't
know what they were,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
so obviously, they
were in that category.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But I was really-- it
was just over my desk.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I was, at the time, trying
to unify the Canadian Armed

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Forces-- the army,
navy, and air force--

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and put them together into
a single defense force,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.835 align:middle line:84%
which is a job that no other
minister of defense had ever--

00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't fathom
what goes into that.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, it' the most
sensible thing,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:84%
because you eliminate about
10% or 15% of pure duplication.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And cut a lot of
costs-- but more important,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
from my standpoint,
the command structure

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
was straighter,
cleaner, clearer,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and so the reaction time
of the forces and son

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
on was much better than
it had ever been before.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:90%
So it was really a pioneering.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:90%
And it took all of my energy.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: UFOs were sitting
in a pile in the corner.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
That's an
understatement, actually.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a long time
after that before I really got

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.145 align:middle line:90%
engaged in the UFO phenomenon.

00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would think
that you would have--

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:84%
this is a total
aside, off topic--

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
but I would have thought
that you would have

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to be an incredibly skilled
politician still yet at a very

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
young age to have
been able to unite

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:90%
those factions of the military.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.750 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a lot of
jockeying for supremacy within.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: It was a very,
very difficult battle.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that I
won was interesting,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think many
people would have stuck it out.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was encouraged to cut
a couple of times and run.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:90%
But I said, no, it's started.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
We're two thirds of the
way across the river,

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're not going to turn
around and go back now.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.734 align:middle line:84%
We're going on to the
other side, and we did.

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
For eight years, we had the
most efficient armed forces

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the new government
started changing things.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.377 align:middle line:84%
And it's been
downhill ever since.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
still a testament

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.075 align:middle line:84%
to your political
skills, persuasiveness,

00:05:39.075 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:90%
and just endurance.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, just tell us a little
tiny back story about you.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Why were you in this
position at the age of 25?

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
What was it about you
that's driven you down

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:90%
this path your whole life?

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, I wasn't
25 when I had this job.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not then,
but when you first

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:90%
entered the House of Commons.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.298 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, I entered
the House of Commons

00:05:57.298 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:84%
because I was
interested in economics.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And at university,
the professors,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.570 align:middle line:84%
when I asked them if recessions
and depressions were necessary,

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:84%
couldn't give me
a straight answer.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:84%
What they said in effect was,
well, they always happen,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:90%
so they're part of the system.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was going to say,
any fool could see that.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:90%
But that didn't satisfy me.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So I started doing
my own research

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and came to the conclusion
they are not necessary.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
We've never had a recession or
depression that was necessary.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:84%
They are all due to
the monetary system--

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we have this
incredibly bad system where

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
97% of all the
money, quote unquote,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
is not really money
at all, but credit.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So the economists were
saying at the time,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be another
depression-- depression-- 1950.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So I said, oh, I've got to try
and do something about this.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So I graduated in May and was
elected in June with the odds

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:90%
15 to one against me.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:13.174 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And then I found,
which any politician finds,

00:07:13.174 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
just because you
have your picture

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.045 align:middle line:84%
in the front page of the
second section in the "Toronto

00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:20.115 align:middle line:84%
Star," the biggest
circulation paper in Canada,

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:84%
that you're not a somebody
when you get to Ottawa.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't really
influence policy,

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:84%
let alone financial
policy, at that stage.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:90%
But the Korean War came along.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And so they did what
they can't do in peacetime.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
They started pumped money,
quote unquote, into the system.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we had
what we call-- we

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:84%
would call the Golden Years for
about the next 20 years or so.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were the best
years that Canada,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and I guess many
other countries, had.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was only
later in the '70s

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
when Milton Friedman's
ideas started

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:84%
overwhelming the economics
profession that things

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:90%
started to go really wrong.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's never been right since.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how our
time flows here today,

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:84%
we may have a second
conversation about this.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
You've written this
book, "The Money Mafia"--

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
absolutely fascinating,
and it actually

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
ties right back to the subject
we're launching into now--

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: That would be good.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which has to do with
secrecy at the very top levels

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and the power being concentrated
in the hands of very

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:90%
few people.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now,
let's go to when

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.559 align:middle line:84%
you did start engaging with the
subject of unidentified flying

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.359 align:middle line:90%
objects.

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, that was only
about 13 years ago, and then

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:84%
only as a sidebar, because
this young man from Ottawa,

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Pierre Juneau, started sending
me information about it.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.475 align:middle line:84%
I said, Pierre, I haven't
got time to look at it.

00:08:54.475 --> 00:08:55.275 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's OK.

00:08:55.275 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Just put it on a shelf and
keep it for another day.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And then he persuaded me
to watch an ABC special put

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:84%
together by the late
Peter Jennings of Ottawa.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And here were all of
these former United States Air

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Force pilots and commercial
pilots and policeman and air

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
traffic controllers
saying, we have seen UFOs.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, why would they go on
air and say that they had seen

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:90%
a UFO if they hadn't?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's in
it for them lie?

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, they're
not lying, really.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
telling the truth.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:90%
But still, it was just a show.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was interested
in it, but that was it.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, then Pierre sent me a book
called "The Day After Roswell."

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this
should be interesting

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:84%
reading for the summertime
when I do my casual reading.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And so when summertime, I looked
for it and couldn't find it

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.234 align:middle line:84%
and had to settle for
"The Life of Pi," which

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:90%
was very entertaining.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.834 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.834 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe you
weren't ready to drop down

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:90%
the rabbit hole just yet.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.105 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: No, not quite.

00:10:10.105 --> 00:10:15.475 align:middle line:84%
And so the following year, I
was looking for another book.

00:10:15.475 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
There was "The
Day After Roswell"

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:90%
staring me right in the face.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So I took it and
started to read it.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was only partway through
it when I thought to myself,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:90%
this is the real thing.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:90%
This isn't fiction.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:84%
This makes sense to me, because
the names of the generals

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and the bases, the
Air Force bases,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:84%
by then-- because it had become
the Air Force after the Second

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:90%
World War-- I recognized.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the way it
sort of worked out,

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:84%
my nephew Philip came along
and said, what are you reading?

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:90%
And I told him.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm a skeptic.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.150 align:middle line:84%
That's fair enough, free
country more or less.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More or less.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: More or less--
certainly less now,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:90%
that's for sure.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:90%
And so he went home.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of days
later, he phoned and said,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.539 align:middle line:84%
I called the general and told
him what you were reading.

00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a retired United
States Air Force--

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.959 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how did he have
access to calling the general?

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Because they had both
been working in the aviation

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And that's
how he knew him.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When we
say "the general,"

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.740 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking about
which general specifically?

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: No.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.557 align:middle line:84%
No, we're not being
specific in that.

00:11:32.557 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.848 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in "The
Day After Roswell,"

00:11:34.848 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
there were a couple
of generals involved

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.885 align:middle line:90%
that Philip Corso talks about.

00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Oh, yes.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:84%
There was General
Twining and others.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Trudeau.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: This is the general.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, every
word is true and more.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So he said, where can I
get a copy of the book?

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:90%
So I told him.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And it just happened, by
then, I had finished the book.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was really convinced
that I had a duty to go public

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and say there were
some issues here

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
that should be in
the public domain.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.950 align:middle line:84%
The American people have the
right to know what's going on.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.616 align:middle line:84%
They have the right
to know what they've

00:12:14.616 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:90%
been financing all these years.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:19.432 align:middle line:84%
They have the right to know what
the situation is-- and not only

00:12:19.432 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
the American people,
but the people

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
of the world, because
we're all in this together.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what
the US does will

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:84%
affect the people of
the world from one side

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.320 align:middle line:90%
around to the other.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And it just happened
that I had been

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:41.555 align:middle line:84%
invited by a couple of
UFOlogists to speak in Toronto.

00:12:41.555 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were Victor
Viggiani and Mike Bird,

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:84%
who were very well
known in our circles

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:90%
and with UFOlogy circles.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And I really had
absolutely no thought

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
of exceeding to their request,
because I'm not a UFOlogist,

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't make
any sense to me.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But after reading the book, I
said, maybe I should accept.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
The only reason I
hadn't declined already

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:90%
was procrastination.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, there
were two hurdles to get over.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
One was the fact that I
was getting married a week

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.650 align:middle line:90%
to the day after a symposium.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And my bride, the widow of my
former best friend, I thought

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.104 align:middle line:90%
should be consulted.

00:13:38.104 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So I phoned her and told
her what I was going to do.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.802 align:middle line:84%
And need I say, she was
not wildly enthusiastic.

00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
You were putting your
reputation on the line.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: That's right.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But she finally said,
if you think that that's

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:90%
what you have to do, OK.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and do it.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.521 align:middle line:84%
And I assured it would just be
a one-off thing-- get it out

00:13:59.521 --> 00:14:01.287 align:middle line:84%
in the public, and
that would be it.

00:14:01.287 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Little did I dream--

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.953 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, here
you are 12 years later.

00:14:03.953 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So the other one was to
double check with the general

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:90%
personally

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: I had met
him on one occasion.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So I got his telephone
number and asked my nephew

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to give him a heads up
that I'd be calling.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:90%
So I called him.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.425 align:middle line:84%
And before I even had time
to say hello, how are you,

00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
he said, every word
is true anymore.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And he spent the next 20
minutes talking about the more,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:90%
to the extent could.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And the more included
the fact that there

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.100 align:middle line:84%
had been face to face meetings
between United States officials

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and beings from other
star systems, period.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So with that assurance--
I was already convinced.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, you really
need that kind of assurance

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:90%
before you go public and say--

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And you were in a unique
position to have that.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yes.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That reassurance.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Right.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So with the reassurance,
I phoned Victor and Mike

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:90%
and said I'll do it.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.766 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before-- we'll get
into a little bit about what

00:15:11.766 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
was contained in "The Day After
Roswell" for people who haven't

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:90%
read it that are watching this.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But before that, once you
made that bold decision,

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:90%
what happened to your life?

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, it changed
dramatically in a sense,

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.165 align:middle line:84%
because the information
started flowing

00:15:28.165 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
in about UFOs and ET
presence, and so on,

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And I got dozens and
dozens of documents.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
pretty thin rule.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
But some of them were
classified and some of them

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
were very, very interesting
and had a lot of information.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And I got a lot of
books, excellent books,

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:90%
from reputable UFOlogists.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And I read them all.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And also, I started getting
requests to meet with people

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:90%
and do something about it.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And the first one was Dr. Steven
Greer, who, in my opinion,

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:84%
is one of the icons of
the UFOlogy business.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would agree.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I was at Disclosure at the
National Press Club back then.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Right.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
an amazing effort.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.120 align:middle line:84%
No one else could have
pulled it together like that.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.036 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely.

00:16:24.036 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:90%
And I just rate him so highly.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's become a friend--
Emily, his wife, too.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very concerned
about her sometimes.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a
three hour briefing

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:90%
on the waterfront in Toronto.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was just the
first of many briefings

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:84%
by UFOlogists all
over the country.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And people were
interested in seeing me.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Shirley MacLaine,
for example, tracked

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:84%
me down when she was in Toronto
and said, let's have dinner.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And it just happened
that my wife was

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.209 align:middle line:90%
going to Montreal that night.

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked her,
she said, go ahead.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So I did, and we
had a splendid time.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Then a few days later,
she phoned and invited us

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:90%
both to dinner.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And we had some pretty
good discussions

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.035 align:middle line:90%
about what she knew.

00:17:27.035 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In UFOlogy?

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And she knows
quite a lot, more, I think,

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.735 align:middle line:84%
than perhaps she's
ever disclosed.

00:17:34.735 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But the deal was that I
wouldn't talk about it

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:90%
except in general terms.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And so
that was one of them.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell case
coming to town.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:52.135 align:middle line:84%
And he was introduced
by Mike Bird, actually.

00:17:52.135 --> 00:17:53.385 align:middle line:90%
They were friends at the time.

00:17:53.385 --> 00:17:58.555 align:middle line:84%
And so Sandra said,
well, let's invite

00:17:58.555 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Edgar and his escort or gal
that was with him for dinner.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I won't go into the long story
about them having a broken

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.281 align:middle line:84%
windshield and having
to go back to Chicago

00:18:10.281 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and get fixed and all
that sort of thing.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: But they finally
got there, and we had dinner.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was very interesting--
Edgar playing a little coy

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.035 align:middle line:90%
and talking about Roswell.

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said "the
alleged crashing."

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.819 align:middle line:90%
I said, come on, Edgar.

00:18:26.819 --> 00:18:28.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Quit saying
"alleged," Edgar.

00:18:28.443 --> 00:18:29.442 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.785 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: His face
turned all red, you know,

00:18:31.785 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:84%
because he knew that
that was not really

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.260 align:middle line:90%
appropriate to the occasion.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And then his next question
was, well, how many species

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.395 align:middle line:90%
do you think that there are?

00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't know.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I suppose somewhere
between two and 12.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes,
that's what I think too.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
But this was in the days
when we didn't have any idea

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.170 align:middle line:90%
how many of there really were.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.413 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: The numbers have gone
up astronomically since then,

00:18:53.413 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So this established
a relationship which

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:90%
continues on until the present.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of
thing has gone on.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And I have met so many of
the really dedicated people

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:84%
in the UFOlogy business
and learned from them,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:90%
every single one of them.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I've listened to
their presentations.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.236 align:middle line:90%
I've read their books.

00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And this has helped
to pick up information

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:84%
really exponentially, in
a way, in the 10 years--

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:35.375 align:middle line:84%
from zero, or year zero, to more
than I can really cope with.

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's as though
the issue needed someone

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
of your stature to be able to
stand up and be able to take

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:84%
whatever came with that by
way of whether-- I mean,

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people, obviously,
are concerned about ridicule.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the big one.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And you don't really
seem to concern yourself

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.910 align:middle line:90%
terribly with all of that.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, I felt
strongly if you know

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and you think it's important
and other people know, then

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
you would be
irresponsible to say so.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: You
have to go public.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people think
you're a bit off, so be it.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not
running for anything.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And I really have no
obligation to people

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
who think that I'm a
little bit of whatever.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I just go my own way
and state the truth as I see it

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and let the chips
fall where they may.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
amazing virtue of yours,

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:84%
because there are
many people that

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
are deeply entrenched, even
now, in the UFO community who

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
will deny the existence
of many aspects of it,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.570 align:middle line:84%
because they're concern
for their own reputations,

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
or, even worse, for
their own book sales.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is really irritating.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.310 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a
fractured community.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're coming in
in the true spirit,

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:84%
as a purist, to simply
forward information,

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:84%
because of your own
positions in life

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
you've had access
to at high levels.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:90%
That makes a big difference.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:84%
You can really
bridge the message.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.358 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Yes, and
I think my former job

00:21:03.358 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:84%
as Minister of National Defense
assists my credibility too,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:10.210 align:middle line:84%
because people who know that
I had no particular reason

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:90%
to stretch the truth.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and put your neck out.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.154 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:15.154 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk for a little
bit, because so many people,

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I think, were brought into the
fold by "Day After Roswell."

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that really
was the book that,

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
back when I read it
in, I think, 2001,

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
really convinced me to start
taking all of the phenomena

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:90%
more seriously as well.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And so for those who have
not read the book, which

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:84%
would be a large percentage
of people watching,

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:84%
can you give us some of the
main capsules of information

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.482 align:middle line:84%
that Philip Corso
brought forward?

00:21:47.482 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, I think,
most importantly, he

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:84%
was also one of the first
major whistleblowers.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmhm.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And he stuck
his neck out, way out.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was because he
too felt that the truth should

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.237 align:middle line:90%
be out there.

00:22:05.237 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we can set him up.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:84%
He was head of the Foreign
Technologies Department.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Right.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:84%
He claimed to have had exposure
to the bodies of an earlier

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.300 align:middle line:90%
stage in another incarnation.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
But then I think it was
about 10 years later when

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
he became in charge
of foreign technology.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Early '60s, yeah.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And what
he describes is

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
how he contrived to take the
stuff from his filing cabinet,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:84%
as they call it,
junk box or whatever,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.807 align:middle line:90%
and insert it into industry.

00:22:41.807 --> 00:22:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
what some of those technologies

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Without saying
where it came from--

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:10%
>>HELLYER: But I mean, the
people he was giving it to,

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.135 align:middle line:10%
many of them would
be wise enough,

00:22:53.135 --> 00:22:57.480 align:middle line:10%
A, not to ask where
it came from; and B,

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:10%
to know that it was beyond
the range of technology

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:10%
that they were familiar
with anywhere here on Earth,

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:10%
and that they could maybe
develop it into something that

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:10%
would be beneficial to
them, both in their careers

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:10%
and in their business relations.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.014 align:middle line:84%
So he did this in
a number of cases.

00:23:20.014 --> 00:23:22.180 align:middle line:84%
He spent most of his time
at it, I guess when they--

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
we're talking about

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
is technology that had been
recovered from the Roswell

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.625 align:middle line:84%
crash and sequestered
by the military.

00:23:27.625 --> 00:23:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: That's correct.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.233 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Different departments.

00:23:29.233 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And it's likely
that it wasn't unique,

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and that the Air
Force and the Navy

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
were probably doing the same
kind of thing, I suspect.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
the way the story's

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
set up, there was a bit of a
grab right after the crash,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
where each of them showed up and
spirited away different pieces

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:90%
and parts.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy had a ship that
they had recovered before.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And so there was enough of
the junk, as of course we

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
would call it, to
spread around to quite

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:84%
a few different
industries and to get

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.124 align:middle line:84%
them working on some
pretty interesting stuff.

00:24:05.124 --> 00:24:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're looking
at the birth of transistors.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about highly
positioned companies,

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.465 align:middle line:84%
large companies of the day--
Bell Labs, Rockwell Lab.

00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:13.265 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:24:13.265 --> 00:24:14.065 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:14.065 --> 00:24:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And on and on,
aerospace industry.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
beginning transistors,

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.320 align:middle line:90%
laser technology, fiber optics.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Fiber optics, yeah.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kevlar for bulletproof
bests for cops down the road.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But those things didn't
exist before prior to this.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So these contracts
were all parted out.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, they had
the discernment to not ask

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:90%
where these pieces came from.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were just released as
inventions from the industry

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.960 align:middle line:90%
No one was the wiser.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Exactly.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And this was, I
think, the main source

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:50.570 align:middle line:84%
of the beneficial part of the
thing to the public, as opposed

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.520 align:middle line:84%
to the military side,
which you can argue

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:84%
may or may not have been
beneficial in the long run.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.737 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: So here, we get
the fallout in these areas.

00:25:01.737 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:90%
And this is the plus side.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:84%
We probably didn't
get as much as we

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:84%
should have in some other areas,
like agriculture and medicine.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.430 align:middle line:90%
But this is another story.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that we
have to keep worrying about

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now,
this is really

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:21.700 align:middle line:84%
what propelled you along
your own path of inquiry,

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:84%
it sounds to me, was you
were looking at how could we

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:90%
possibly benefit from this?

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:29.000 align:middle line:84%
It had already been
known since the '40s

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.450 align:middle line:84%
that we were
collaborating, right?

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Right.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how can we
benefit from technologies that

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:90%
are more advanced than our own?

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yes.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.320 align:middle line:84%
But I was also concerned
about the military aspects.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.509 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true, yes.

00:25:42.509 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Because what
were the Air Force,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.285 align:middle line:84%
the United States
Air Force doing?

00:25:46.285 --> 00:25:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Were they shooting
at these people?

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:90%
The answer, yes.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:90%
All of them?

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, there
were a lot of instances

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:84%
when fighter planes were watched
and followed them and tried

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:90%
to shoot at them.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.206 align:middle line:84%
And they did shoot
at them, found,

00:26:08.206 --> 00:26:12.040 align:middle line:84%
in many case, that they had
protective measures that

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
kept them from being
shot down at that stage.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But it was also my
concern about where

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:84%
this would lead ultimately,
that I was concerned about,

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:34.255 align:middle line:84%
still am, and wanted
to know more about,

00:26:34.255 --> 00:26:36.382 align:middle line:84%
thought the public
should know more about.

00:26:36.382 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
the public knows

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:90%
very little to this day, still.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's shocking,
if not criminal,

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that that has been kept from
our view this many years later.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about the
mechanism through which this

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
intelligence communities

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that were given birth
to-- OSS, NSA, CIA,

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:84%
all of it-- how this
started coming about,

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and what impact that
had at large on society

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:84%
once they decided that
this had to be kept secret.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So somebody made the decision
that this information

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:84%
should be kept from
the public at all cost.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And the cost has been
very great in some cases,

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:84%
because they have,
in effect, taken

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:90%
the law into their own hands.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
They have become an
integral part of the cabal,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.460 align:middle line:90%
as I call it.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And they just ignore
ordinary laws in the sense

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:84%
that if somebody talks too much,
they rough them up, threaten--

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or worse.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Or worse-- threaten
to take away their pensions,

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and in some cases, kill them.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And they make this
very obvious as a deterrent.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this is not
the rule of law.

00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:84%
This is not the constitutional
approach to things.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.360 align:middle line:84%
This is an off law
situation and represents

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
what has become
known as the shadow

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:84%
government or the alternative
government of the United

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:84%
States, which
President Clinton made

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.044 align:middle line:84%
very clear he didn't control,
nor have many other presidents.

00:28:20.044 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, in his
famous statement--

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
there is a government that
exists in the shadows,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:90%
and I have no control over it.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:84%
After [INAUDIBLE],
I think, asked him

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
a question directly of
why he didn't, in effect,

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:84%
let the people always
know what was going on.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And that was his defense--
amazing statement, very true.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they had an
operating separately.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think their
main connection

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:52.681 align:middle line:84%
to the legitimate government
is the receipt of funds,

00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:55.030 align:middle line:84%
that they have
financial backing.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Massive amounts
of off the books money.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Massive.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which also
interfaces with drug cartels,

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.060 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just a dark morass of
illegal behaviors and secrecy.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:07.642 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Quite so.

00:29:07.642 --> 00:29:08.442 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmhm.

00:29:08.442 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And at Disclosure, I think
one of the things to me--

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.550 align:middle line:84%
because I was there with
Steven Greer's group-- that

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:84%
was so compelling it is
to watch behind the scenes

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:84%
as these, especially
the men who have been

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:84%
in the military
their entire lives,

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:28.130 align:middle line:84%
were coming forward and
breaking their security oaths.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And as they did this, I saw men
in tears after the Disclosure

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and even before the
actual presentation

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.540 align:middle line:90%
at the National Press Club.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if that
doesn't tell you everything--

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that these people have been
carrying this burden for so

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
long, yet are so
afraid even now,

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:84%
after all these years
of the repercussions,

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and still came forward-- I
think that spoke to me as

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:90%
loudly as the testimony itself.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yes.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:04.316 align:middle line:84%
And more recently, Stephen--
what's his last name?

00:30:04.316 --> 00:30:05.116 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Greer?

00:30:05.116 --> 00:30:05.542 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: No.

00:30:05.542 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Stephen Bassett.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: [INAUDIBLE]
Stephen Bassett.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.225 align:middle line:90%
The other Stephen.

00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:12.385 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Right,
the other Stephen--

00:30:12.385 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:84%
of the 40 people he
put together in 2013,

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.930 align:middle line:84%
the consensus was
that all of this

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:84%
had nothing to do with
national security.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:27.430 align:middle line:90%
It was greed and power.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the secrecy
itself, it was so insidious.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- now,
this was in the '80s,

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.290 align:middle line:90%
as a young news anchor.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:84%
We had writers and other
reports coming across the wire

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.860 align:middle line:84%
from around the world
of UFO sightings,

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:84%
where a local police force
and seen it and all that.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.480 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely
verboten for me,

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:84%
as an anchor, to put that
on the air, even if I said,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:84%
come on, guys, let's put
this on-- not allowed.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, at Disclosure,
one of the people

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:84%
in the room who
was there for-- I

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:07.960 align:middle line:84%
think they were the local
ABC affiliate in DC-- when

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.700 align:middle line:84%
someone in the
audience said, well,

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.270 align:middle line:84%
if this is real,
how come we don't

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:90%
hear about it on television?

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And he stood up and
said the same thing.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:90%
He said, we know about it.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:90%
We're not allowed.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.920 align:middle line:84%
The media-- there is a
lock down on that subject.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.250 align:middle line:84%
That Peter Jennings had
the force of will-- maybe

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:84%
they just thought it would
be a sweeps, big numbers

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.876 align:middle line:84%
thing-- but that he
had the force of will

00:31:28.876 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get
that out to the point

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.200 align:middle line:84%
where it was credible enough
that even you and others

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.520 align:middle line:84%
at that level said,
hm, I think we

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.710 align:middle line:84%
have to examine the phenomenon,
was absolutely a feat.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: It's
really frightening

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.000 align:middle line:90%
that the press is so controlled.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is.

00:31:48.075 --> 00:31:48.875 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:31:48.875 --> 00:31:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: So controlled.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, one of the areas I
wanted to hop forward to-- you

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:84%
had spoken in one of
your talks about Serpo.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And I have interviewed
Len Kasten.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to ask you--
and we'll just a little

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.840 align:middle line:84%
framework for
Serpo, because that

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:84%
was a direct knocked on
effect from Roswell, right,

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:21.040 align:middle line:84%
with the EPS, the biological
entities that were captured?

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.130 align:middle line:90%
One of them did live.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.150 align:middle line:90%
The others died, right?

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Right.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:25.949 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so one of
the little beings lived.

00:32:25.949 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was
dialogue that occurred

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.850 align:middle line:84%
between them and our
military, or secret shadow

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:90%
military factions.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.341 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: I think
the story I read--

00:32:33.341 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and it may or may not be
EB number one-- suggested

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:90%
an exchange.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And
President John Kennedy,

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:90%
he decided that that was OK.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.810 align:middle line:90%
And it all started there.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:56.465 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the secrecy which
surrounded it was unequaled.

00:32:56.465 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was fascinating
what they did to these guys.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here they put
an ad in the paper.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And these poor
unsuspecting souls--

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how was
worded-- showed up,

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and wow, they dropped
off everything.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:90%
That was it, off radar.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't exist
any longer once they said yes

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:90%
to this project.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.845 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And the
price they paid--

00:33:15.845 --> 00:33:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.341 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: I read
some of the things,

00:33:18.341 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:84%
like being buried
underground for several days

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.855 align:middle line:84%
to see how
claustrophobic you were.

00:33:24.855 --> 00:33:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And I felt awful just
reading about it.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once they agreed to
do this project or experiment,

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.260 align:middle line:84%
they wanted people who were
single, had no children,

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and ideally were
orphaned themselves.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, once
they went missing,

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.590 align:middle line:84%
nobody would miss them
or be looking for them.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Right.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were washed.

00:33:44.175 --> 00:33:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Their identity was
completely washed.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:84%
They were sequestered
in a federal prison.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Was it Leavenworth?

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Federal prison-- for
what, a year or two

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.670 align:middle line:84%
prior to taking
off on this thing,

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:90%
so they couldn't talk to anyone.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this was intense.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately,
the day came when

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
they, according to Anonymous--
and this, of course,

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.650 align:middle line:90%
is the thing.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Who can talk about
this publicly?

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So the person that's
credited with this

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.210 align:middle line:84%
was involved in the project,
but they're called Anonymous.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's how people
tried to discredit it.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is the way
that the whole system is worked

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.130 align:middle line:84%
now-- that when
the powers that be

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:84%
want information in the public
hands, that they leak it.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And then it's deniable.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:33.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:33.785 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: But as
far as I'm concerned,

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:40.909 align:middle line:84%
Anonymous was doing what he
was told to do by the Defense

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency, because
the DIA was established,

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.889 align:middle line:84%
as you know, McNamara and
Kennedy because Kennedy

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.449 align:middle line:90%
was worried about CIA.

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And they
wanted something

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.340 align:middle line:90%
that was more transparent.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.580 align:middle line:90%
And they are.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:84%
They're showing
here 25 years after,

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.840 align:middle line:90%
which is a long time to wait.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.330 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, this
is what happened

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:90%
and this is how it happened.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.131 align:middle line:84%
And these are some of the things
that you should know about it.

00:35:06.131 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
it's phenomenal.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.430 align:middle line:84%
In nature, there's
nothing else like it

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:10.724 align:middle line:90%
that has been admitted to.

00:35:10.724 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
12 individuals--

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.569 align:middle line:90%
pick the story up from there.

00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:15.368 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:35:15.368 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing to me is

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.040 align:middle line:84%
that even though this is
in the public domain now,

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.160 align:middle line:90%
nobody's talking about it.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I'm
saying, nobody knows about it.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to bring it
up, they'd say, oh, come on,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.690 align:middle line:90%
that's sci-fi.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Exactly.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Somebody asked me yesterday,
do you believe that?

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Of
course I believe it.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And well, the 12 individuals,
and ultimately, they

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.440 align:middle line:84%
were taken aboard an
alien ship, a scout car,

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.125 align:middle line:84%
which was loaded with I think
47 tons of goodies of all kinds,

00:35:45.125 --> 00:35:51.500 align:middle line:84%
from weapons to little radio
sets to hundreds of records.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Massive cargo.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Yeah,
all kinds of stuff.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.268 align:middle line:84%
And then the scout car took
it up to the mothership.

00:35:57.268 --> 00:35:58.976 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and
guns, just in case they

00:35:58.976 --> 00:36:00.290 align:middle line:90%
needed to defend themselves.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.728 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Oh, they had guns.

00:36:00.728 --> 00:36:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they had guns, yeah,
which they never used.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.313 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: But oh, maybe-- I
don't know if they did kill

00:36:05.313 --> 00:36:07.174 align:middle line:84%
the snake or not,
whether they used--

00:36:07.174 --> 00:36:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't remember
if they killed the snake.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah, that was a--

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They may
have killed the snake.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: --a big upset.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was an odd snake.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:13.415 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:36:13.415 --> 00:36:14.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: So all
of this stuff was

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:22.320 align:middle line:84%
loaded aboard the mothership,
and away they went, finally.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
first little while,

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:84%
when they're going through the
time warp, they were all sick.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: After they
got through that and then

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.560 align:middle line:90%
the wormhole, they were OK.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And 10 months later, they had
gone 38 million light years'

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:47.910 align:middle line:84%
distance, in 10 months, which
is absolutely incredible.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:48.710 align:middle line:90%
And then one day--

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Incomprehensible
without understanding

00:36:50.075 --> 00:36:51.050 align:middle line:90%
that kind of physics.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely,
because even

00:36:54.570 --> 00:37:01.010 align:middle line:84%
one of my sons-- bright person,
if I may say so-- just says,

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:04.445 align:middle line:84%
you know, Einstein
said, and that's it

00:37:04.445 --> 00:37:06.850 align:middle line:90%
as far as he's concerned.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And my reaction
is well, you don't

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.760 align:middle line:84%
know how much-- this is
my famous line from "Light

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.190 align:middle line:90%
at the End of the Tunnel."

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how much I didn't
know because I didn't know

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:20.870 align:middle line:90%
how much there was to know.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's as true
today as it was then.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: It's just
like a scroll-- you know,

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:27.515 align:middle line:90%
a Jewish scroll.

00:37:27.515 --> 00:37:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And it comes out and then it
goes back after the service.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But this is a scroll
that goes out both ways,

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and it keeps going on and on and
on, not back, but to infinity.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: So you can never
comprehend all of these things.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just a question of how
far you can go in one lifetime

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and how much information
you can absorb.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
was Planet Serpo,

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the book that was ultimately
put out by Len Kasten.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And for anybody that wants to
go into the nitty gritty of it,

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:03.645 align:middle line:84%
I did an hour or two with
him in a conversation

00:38:03.645 --> 00:38:04.445 align:middle line:90%
a few months ago.

00:38:04.445 --> 00:38:06.486 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: I'm glad you
did that, because there's

00:38:06.486 --> 00:38:08.550 align:middle line:84%
so much information
in that book,

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and other related
subjects, including

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:84%
the influence of the
reptilians through

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:22.930 align:middle line:84%
the secret organizations
establishing Hitler.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:27.392 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And effectively,
the whole Nazi movement.

00:38:27.392 --> 00:38:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
affects our economy

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:33.530 align:middle line:84%
to this day and
politics and the world.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a second conversation.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.730 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.720 align:middle line:84%
We've been chatting
about 40 minutes already.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Have we?

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're barely
into the subject of UFOlogy.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But what I would
like, because people

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.880 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of places to
go for this research,

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:84%
including your own work and
the books you've written.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Can you just kind of
give us a statement

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:57.190 align:middle line:84%
of urgency, clarity whatever you
wish, regarding the need for us

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.196 align:middle line:84%
to start embracing this
before we talk about money?

00:39:00.196 --> 00:39:00.996 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: OK.

00:39:00.996 --> 00:39:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we have to
somehow persuade our governments

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.760 align:middle line:90%
to level with us.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
we're going to do it.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think we have to
keep worrying away at it

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:18.190 align:middle line:90%
and get the information out.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And people have to get
it in small chunks,

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.250 align:middle line:84%
because if it all was spilled
in one day, first of all,

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.630 align:middle line:84%
it would be impossible to do,
even one week or one month,

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:90%
because there's too much.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.890 align:middle line:84%
But if it comes out
in small pieces,

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:38.970 align:middle line:84%
people will be able
to accommodate to it,

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and to look at some
of the alternatives.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And the alternatives,
I think, really affect

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:90%
the future of humankind.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:52.410 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:56.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't know where we're going.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the cabal
and the alternate government

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.530 align:middle line:90%
has in store for us.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.930 align:middle line:84%
We suspect, and
with good reason,

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that they're planning to set
up a world government which

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.880 align:middle line:84%
is a dictatorship, largely
for their own benefit

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and at the expense of
all the rest of us.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, it is
the same kind of situation

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:90%
that they have on Planet Serpo.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And so these are
the reasons why I

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:84%
think we have to get
into this information,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:44.390 align:middle line:84%
because are we going to
continue just going along

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:50.380 align:middle line:84%
an ignorant path until it's
too late to save our species?

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.380 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
some people involved

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:58.970 align:middle line:84%
in this prospect who
believe that they could

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:03.800 align:middle line:84%
start a thermonuclear
war, first strike,

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and wipe out the military
potential of both China

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.840 align:middle line:90%
and Russia and survive.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.270 align:middle line:90%
This is absolute total insanity.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe if there's a
saving grace to understanding

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that we are galactic in
nature, some of these attempts

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.360 align:middle line:84%
have been, to one degree or
another, made in the past,

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.905 align:middle line:90%
and it hasn't been allowed.

00:41:32.905 --> 00:41:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: You mean by
the extraterrestrials?

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yes.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
things we must know.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: So that
we know how to react.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's kind of
comforting, in a way,

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to know if we're
not smart enough

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.298 align:middle line:84%
to look out for ourselves, at
least someone else is helping

00:41:45.298 --> 00:41:46.710 align:middle line:90%
us avoid that kind of disaster.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Unless our guys are working for
the wrong side, in which case,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:52.679 align:middle line:90%
heaven help us.

00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, heaven help us.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.136 align:middle line:84%
But you know, you were
talking about this controlled

00:41:56.136 --> 00:41:58.360 align:middle line:90%
information, bits at a time.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.950 align:middle line:84%
It has been happening
through Hollywood, right?

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Steven Spielberg.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Oh, yes.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And here, we
have "Close Encounters

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.810 align:middle line:90%
of the Third Kind."

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.320 align:middle line:90%
We have the show "Taken."

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.530 align:middle line:90%
We have "ET."

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:11.792 align:middle line:84%
These were all put out there
to help us, as a species,

00:42:11.792 --> 00:42:14.125 align:middle line:84%
become comfortable with the
notion that we're not alone.

00:42:14.125 --> 00:42:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Right.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:15.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, if we want
to save our planet-- sorry.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:27.986 align:middle line:84%
If we want to save our
species, we have to change.

00:42:27.986 --> 00:42:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And especially
since World War II,

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:38.490 align:middle line:84%
we have become so self-centered,
so grasping, so determined,

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:84%
especially with the
military-industrial complex

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and cabal, to start one
war after another in order

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.382 align:middle line:90%
to require--

00:42:47.382 --> 00:42:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Line their pockets.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Yeah, to
line their pockets

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.930 align:middle line:90%
at the expense of people.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:90%
And this is wrong, wrong, wrong.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And after the Cold
War ended, we should

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.090 align:middle line:90%
have had a real peace dividend.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:84%
We should have them divert
billions, hundreds of billions

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:10.450 align:middle line:84%
of dollars from
defense expenditures

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:84%
to build a better world,
a peaceful world, where

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:19.180 align:middle line:84%
ordinary people of all
shades and religions,

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:24.050 align:middle line:84%
regardless of who they were, had
enough to eat, enough to water

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:28.175 align:middle line:84%
to drink and shirt on their
back and get a basic education

00:43:28.175 --> 00:43:30.487 align:middle line:84%
and a basic health
care and so on.

00:43:30.487 --> 00:43:31.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what we should have done.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.010 align:middle line:84%
The peace dividend,
it was called.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And some of us hoped
and prayed it would happen.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't happen.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:90%
We went the wrong way.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:40.320 align:middle line:90%
We made the wrong decision.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
incredible expenditure

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:47.200 align:middle line:90%
on space technology.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, we've got
to change our priorities,

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:57.320 align:middle line:84%
or we could wind up
losing our whole species.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
some of the ETs

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.780 align:middle line:84%
don't care that much, because
it's the planet they're

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.760 align:middle line:90%
really concerned about.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.283 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: That
they're more concerned

00:44:09.283 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:90%
about having it survive.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you destroy the surface
of the Earth, some of them

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.570 align:middle line:84%
would survive,
because a lot of them

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.510 align:middle line:84%
live underground or
underwater anyway.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:25.970 align:middle line:90%
But we'd be gone.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.885 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we can do-- and
I've ended some of my speeches,

00:44:29.885 --> 00:44:33.320 align:middle line:84%
as you know, with
saying the missing link

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.950 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual link.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:90%
And morality.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:43.360 align:middle line:84%
We have to say to sublimate our
egos and change our priorities

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and say it's important to treat
other people as we would wish

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.260 align:middle line:84%
to be treated,
which we don't now.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.550 align:middle line:10%
We have these people
saying, we have

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:55.940 align:middle line:10%
to keep minimum wages down.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:02.390 align:middle line:10%
And I've read a piece of paper
about some state government's

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:04.840 align:middle line:10%
going to take away
from the municipalities

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.430 align:middle line:10%
the right to set
minimum wages so

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.700 align:middle line:10%
that they wouldn't raise them.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.050 align:middle line:84%
What kind of viable
approach is that?

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.950 align:middle line:90%
What kind of a life is that?

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
callous and uncaring.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I'm with you--
a reestablishment of some kind

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:22.384 align:middle line:90%
of larger morality--

00:45:22.384 --> 00:45:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --with a spiritual
basis of some kind.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And then deference
to the Creator and the creation.

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And if we did that,
there would be hope.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.938 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that not,
thank you very much, Paul.

00:45:34.938 --> 00:45:36.312 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: It's
been my pleasure.

00:45:36.312 --> 00:45:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The question
is how much longer

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.410 align:middle line:84%
do we feel we need to
wait to feel satisfied

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.890 align:middle line:84%
that the question of alien
interface with humanity

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:90%
has been addressed?

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Then what?

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we need to begin
asking new questions.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.890 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
