00:00:19.738 --> 00:00:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Glenn
Steckling is back with us with

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:90%
his new book, "The UFO Reality--

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Can Truth Prevail?"

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:10%
Good question.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:10%
The field is fraught
with disinformation

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:10%
and misinformation, so how are
we to sort through what's true?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Glenn and find out.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Glenn, welcome back.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GLENN STECKLING:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to be here.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank so much for
sending me this suite of books,

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:90%
again, particularly--

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
I just have a love affair
with the George Adamski

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:84%
story, the time where it seemed
that truth was prevailing.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yes.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And of course, he was
ridiculed as a result of it.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's a story that
continues to this day.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:90%
More revelations continue.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.463 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
George Adamski in a bit.

00:00:58.463 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd like to
talk about first--

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
you and I were
talking off camera.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion of
disclosure-- disclosure,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
disclosure, all of these sites,
conspiracy sites, UFO sites--

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:90%
disclosure is here.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.463 align:middle line:90%
Disclosure is almost here.

00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:90%
They're all going to prison.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Then we have every
iteration of this story.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said to you, but
Steven Greer, I thought,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:84%
did a very noble job
of disclosure in 2001.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And you said, yeah, but it was
destined to failure because it

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:90%
had already happened.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about winding
the clock back to 1960

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:90%
and what had already happened.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say this,
because a lot of people

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.148 align:middle line:84%
have seen "Project Blue
Book" on the History Channel

00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and understand a
lot of that is true.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And you see what
the dynamics were.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:90%
So now you take it away.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: Before we
do that leap in time,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:10%
we have to understand
that what was attempted

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:10%
in early disclosure
in '92 and 2001

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:10%
was a method of
trying to pressure

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:10%
the government and the
intelligence community

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:10%
to fess up.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And you can
never pressure these people.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:90%
That is a fallacy.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And to think that
you can go in there

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and push these people
to finally say,

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going
to give it to you,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:90%
that's never going to happen.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:90%
But history is repetitive.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And we already saw
this same procedure

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:90%
take place in the early 1960s.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Major Donald Keyhoe
was part of NICAP.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:90%
And NICAP collected--

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us who
NICAP is, what NICAP was.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, NICAP
was an organization

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.635 align:middle line:90%
that collected UFO reports.

00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was
concurrent with Project Blue

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Book?

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, some
of the same, shall we say,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
recognizable figures in NICAP
were also political figures

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Hillenkoetter,
Major Keyhoe,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Edward Ruppelt--
these people were

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
all part of the 1950s
collection of data.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And by 1960, they had
over 11,000 reports

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs, photographs,
eyewitnesses, and whatnot.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the attempt was then
to transition into Congress

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.830 align:middle line:84%
in order to get them to pressure
the intelligence community,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
because the Air
Force was initially

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
responsible for all
UFO collection data.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the CIA took
that over in 1953,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and then the Air Force would
funnel it through to them.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
an attempt there

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
in the early '60s under
John McCormack, who

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
was Speaker of the House,
and other congressmen

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:90%
to get some of this information.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And Donald Keyhoe was
instrumental in providing

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:90%
that information to them.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was impossible to get.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
John McCormack said
they're running

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.542 align:middle line:84%
into a major blockage
of any release of data

00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:54.292 align:middle line:84%
from the institutions
that are holding it.

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally stonewalling.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Totally
stonewalling it, exactly.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we already saw then and
also towards the late '60s with

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Professor James McDonald
the pressure to try to get,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:84%
before the Condon
Report came out--

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --in '69, to
release this information

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.839 align:middle line:84%
or more of the
information to the public.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And once again, it was
shut down and stonewalled.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And the same political
forces that governed then

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
are reciprocated
into latter history.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Many of the same people
that were recognizable,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
whether it was George Bush
Sr., the director of the CIA

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:90%
under Nixon--

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Donald Rumsfeld was later
secretary of defense.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And you've got many of the
same recognizable names

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
that were dominoed downstream
into later historical contact.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:90%
These people weren't going to--

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're not going
to let you twist their arm.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.242 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They're
not going to let

00:04:53.242 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
you twist their arm, because
the UFO subject is more highly

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
classified than the Manhattan
Project was to the atomic bomb.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: It remains the
most highly classified subject

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:90%
in our arsenal.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And the last president to
really have full access to it

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.713 align:middle line:90%
was John Kennedy.

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
talk about that in the story.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate that
Project Blue Book, even

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:90%
though it had some fiction--

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
we talked to Paul
Hynek recently--

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:84%
did carry a lot
of the bones of it

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and did include the
Kennedy part of the story.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was gutsy.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, yes, but
it was much more than that.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Franklin Roosevelt was briefed.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Eisenhower--

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.715 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Adamski
briefed Eisenhower

00:05:38.715 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:84%
by taking him to the
air base in California

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.410 align:middle line:84%
in which one of
these craft landed.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And then years later,
with Kennedy in '62

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and the attorney
general Bobby, they

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.782 align:middle line:84%
did the same thing in
the California desert

00:05:51.782 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:90%
to a different base.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
firsthand briefing.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And as time went on, less
and less of this occurred.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
By the time we got to Nixon,
he had only partial access.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why is that?

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Because
it was determined

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:84%
that the secrecy of
maintaining the UFO secrecy

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
had to be classified
at a level which there

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:90%
was very little access to.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
We have this illusion that
in this democracy of ours

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:84%
the president is running
the country, and he's not.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I mean,
not by a long shot.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And so as time went
on, it was determined

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:84%
by the institutions
that hold this material

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:84%
that these political
figures were not

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
to be trusted to be given any
information because they are

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:84%
all too willing to trade it
for votes, or promise of votes,

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:90%
or anything else.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how many--

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.432 align:middle line:84%
Carter, who had
his own sighting--

00:06:51.432 --> 00:06:52.232 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:52.232 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --when he was
in a nuclear submarine--

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And asked to
be briefed in on it.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.372 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
asked to be briefed.

00:06:56.372 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:90%
And he was disavowed.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And the promise that was made
by Clinton and the promise that

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
was made by Hillary
Clinton, all these people,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
they are trying to promise
you something in order

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to gain votes, but they do not
have access to it themselves.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:90%
It's way past their level.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we have run
into this block.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And why is that block?

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.873 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we're
going back to 1969.

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Is that when the
Condon Report came out?

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Yeah,
on Inauguration Day

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.177 align:middle line:90%
of Richard Nixon on purpose.

00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There you go, Richard
Nixon, OK, to be buried.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So you hire some stooges to
put out a report-- eh, nothing

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:90%
to it, basically nothing to it.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:90%
And there you go.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Now it's publicly
dead in the water.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
the Condon Report

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
was a vehicle here of the
University of Colorado,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at the quotations

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
from the interim memos
which are available,

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:84%
it states that the research
is to be done specifically

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:90%
by nonbelievers.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so they
have basically set up

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.978 align:middle line:90%
the scientific--

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Set it up.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --experiment
to be totally biased

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:90%
in an opposite direction.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying, well, we're
going to make Oswald the patsy,

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and we will only take the
information that we can--

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That justifies that.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.538 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --that
justifies that,

00:08:12.538 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
even though the amount of
information that was contrary

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:90%
was a whole library full.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.570 align:middle line:90%
And they just simply ignored it.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the Condon
Report was designated

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to use the same
psychological method.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically
psychology 101.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:84%
This is how we have learned
to control the masses.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
here we are decades

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
later, I mean, what,
four decades later, five

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:90%
decades later.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're really
just now starting

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.240 align:middle line:90%
to see some cracks within it.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.215 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time where
you're having, for example,

00:08:49.215 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
the reports that
start coming out

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
in 2017 through "The
New York Times--"

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:90%
this is old information.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yes.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Pilot
engagement with craft--

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:10%
really low level stuff,
but still compelling.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet the larger story
continues to be repressed.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what's
happened in its place

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:84%
over the decades has been
massive amounts of people--

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- freelancing,
conspiracy theories.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Even Steven Greer, who
I thought was really

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
doing an admirable job trying to
put the later disclosure-- '92,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:84%
2001, the one I
attended-- together,

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:84%
there has been so
much corruption.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to use your words.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:84%
A kaleidoscope of
confusion is what

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:84%
you now call the UFO
community, saying

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:90%
it's its own worst enemy.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's start there with
all the disinformation

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:90%
and misinformation.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.695 align:middle line:90%
Just intrigue or what?

00:09:42.695 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: The
second half of my book

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:90%
is dealing expressly with this.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the chapters is called
the illusion of disclosure.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:84%
The other one is called the
hoax of alien abductions

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what has happened
is that the train wreck

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
of what this UFO
field has become

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
has accelerated to a point
where people are either jumping

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:90%
on or jumping off.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Most are staying on the
train because that's

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:90%
where the recognition lies.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Most of the entire exploitation
of the UFO field is

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
for recognition,
self-acclamation--

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Profit.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --profit, and a
few other little egotistical

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:90%
backdrops as well.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.072 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so
what has happened

00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
is that there is no
care, no consideration

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:84%
for the consequences
of that action.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
It has become easier to join
them than to work against them.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And so we have
developed a dogma--

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:90%
this already began in 1961--

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.320 align:middle line:84%
where it was determined to
take the UFO field divergent.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And the divergent was into
fear, aggression, threat,

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:84%
mutilations, bizarrity,
this kind of thing.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Eisenhower
was aware of this?

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I would say that
the divergence came in '61.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.622 align:middle line:90%
Eisenhower was out of office.

00:11:14.622 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:84%
He, of course, gave
you the warning

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.721 align:middle line:84%
about the military
industrial complex.

00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He warned, yes.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yes.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
He knew more than he could
say, which most people do.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he was there
in that lead-up to that split.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.637 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, he was also
the only five-star general.

00:11:25.637 --> 00:11:26.437 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:26.437 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so that he
had already, shall we say,

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
reports in the European theaters
of war of these alien craft--

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.183 align:middle line:84%
the foo fighters, the
motherships, the spacecraft.

00:11:35.183 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he
was knowledgeable.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: He
was knowledgeable.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But he also saw the other
side of the equation,

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:90%
which was the opposing force.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And the opposing force wants
to take this divergent,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and they want to do that
for a particular reason.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And that reason is to deny
the people of this planet

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
their rightful advancement
and progression into a better

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.110 align:middle line:84%
society and better world
which will take them

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:84%
the next step into outer
space in association

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of the visitors
that come from these planets

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:90%
and from these systems.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it would change the
entire dynamics of how--

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The power structure.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: We
are micromanaged.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
that has continued.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And now what has happened is
by that divergence the UFO

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:90%
community, not knowing better--

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
because they really don't
know what they're talking

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:90%
about to a great degree--

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
they have jumped on that
train, and they have also

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.890 align:middle line:84%
accelerated with it because it
carries them to the recognition

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:90%
that they want.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this subject
has become such a kaleidos--

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:84%
basically you can
say a garbage bin.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So much infighting.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have been
fascinated and intrigued

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:84%
with the subject at its
roots, about the notion

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a universe
that's populated

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
with other far more,
in certain ways,

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle line:84%
intelligent species,
but not necessarily

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:90%
superior species in a way.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:84%
The human being is
an amazing complex

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
when you look at us
from a spiritual level.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:84%
When you look at us from
a conscious mind level,

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:90%
maybe not so impressive.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
levels of intelligence.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to
open ourselves up

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
to the experience, and
knowledge, and wisdom

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:84%
of other cultures, to say
nothing of clean technology

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, just seems
the right thing to do.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So I am always
driven forward trying

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
to find more of that
information, which

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:90%
is hard to find now.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: There
is a denominator

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that people need
to take seriously.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:84%
In order to travel
space successfully,

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:84%
we're talking a technology
that is at least 2,000

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:90%
to 4,000 years ahead of us.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:84%
We are just capable
of getting to the Moon

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:84%
by using slingshot effect to
an object that we can see.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Go 50 million miles,
100 million miles,

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:84%
200 million miles
into the space,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and you are surrounded by
a three-dimensional cluster

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.520 align:middle line:90%
of stars and star systems.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
They're all just
pinpoints of light.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like,
well, that one's Earth.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's go that direction.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't define
which one it is

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
unless you had the technology
to map its frequency,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to map the electromagnetic
lines of space--

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --and use
those in order to travel.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And so to technologically
advance 3,000, 4,000 years,

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
you are still not a caveman in
your sociological development

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
because that is
drawn along with you.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It has to be.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:90%
We can see that replicated here.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
done is we say,

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:84%
well, they may
come and visit us,

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
but they're still going to be
bizarre in their appearance.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
They're still
going to be archaic

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
in their characteristics,
brutal in their thinking.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And that all goes
out the window,

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:84%
because you don't travel
space if you still

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:90%
maintain that mentality.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:90%
And this is, I mean--

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:84%
well, George
Adamski's experiences

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:84%
showed him how these rivers
of energy and space work,

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:84%
for example, showed
how interstellar space

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:84%
travel occurred, showed how
civilizations elsewhere lived.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was really all very
compelling and very beautiful,

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.400 align:middle line:90%
and yet he was shot down.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, we found that
the descriptions that he gave

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
were the information
given directly

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:90%
to him by his space contacts.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: He was
basically a conduit.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And we have also
found that over the last 60

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
years what the man said has
come to fruition and to truth.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.298 align:middle line:84%
We have determined that
space is moving, that there

00:15:44.298 --> 00:15:45.465 align:middle line:90%
are electromagnetic storms--

00:15:45.465 --> 00:15:46.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:46.265 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --that the sun
gives off radiation, not heat,

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.217 align:middle line:90%
and goes on, and on, and on.

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:52.092 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All these
things he said back then.

00:15:52.092 --> 00:15:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: All these things.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Here's an interesting thing--

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.020 align:middle line:84%
talk about rehash
of information.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:84%
About 10 years ago,
we decided to release

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:90%
that Mars has saltwater.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, if
you look in the 1961

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:84%
publishing of George Adamski,
that's exactly what he said.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so this is
what this has come down to.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.970 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly given
the rehashed information.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Keyhoe's
book, Frank Edwards' "Flying

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Saucers, Serious Business,"
and a host of others,

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:84%
we realize that the accounts
taken by pilots, airline pilots

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and military pilots, are volumes
full already during that time.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And so now they say to
you, oh, look, the Navy

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:90%
has this video of this UFO.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.112 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:41.112 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
people, of course,

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.162 align:middle line:84%
don't remember
back to that time,

00:16:44.162 --> 00:16:45.495 align:middle line:90%
or secondly they don't do much--

00:16:45.495 --> 00:16:46.904 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Usually it's
like 20 years back or so.

00:16:46.904 --> 00:16:47.895 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They
don't do much research.

00:16:47.895 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they don't.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They don't,
because they want everything

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:90%
handed to them on a platter.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They want to
have a simple story.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, they
want a simple story

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:90%
that they can justify.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: So since
watching science fiction since

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:84%
the '50s and we have
looked at the studios,

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:84%
the government military studios
that's right across from

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood, which goes ahead and
screens all sci-fi scripts--

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.388 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --if you look
at the book "Hollywood Vs.

00:17:17.388 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:10%
the Aliens" or "Silver
Screen Flying Saucers"

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:10%
it speaks specifically of
promoting a specific agenda--

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:10%
bombarding the
public with screaming

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:10%
monsters that come here
to do something to you,

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:10%
and that overtake your
planet, and that we're

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:10%
so special that they
want to take our cows

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.210 align:middle line:10%
and everything else.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have promoted
a sci-fi agenda

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:84%
that has been incorporated
into the agenda

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that we want that
divergence to go.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have arrived
at the sorry state of this UFO

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:90%
community that we are now.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So is the mess that
we're seeing top down?

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:90%
We know the individual players.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
We know the people that
maybe are getting something

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
on a monetary or
egoic level out of it.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But is a lot of
this really being

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.028 align:middle line:90%
manipulated from the top down?

00:18:08.028 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Not anymore.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now it's
freelance players.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: What has happened
is when we went divergent

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
in '61, the
intelligence community,

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
the CIA wanted to see if
the ball would be picked up.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:90%
And they no longer--

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
by the time they
hit the mid-1970s,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.572 align:middle line:90%
they no longer needed to go--

00:18:29.572 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They let everyone
do it to ourselves.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: That's
exactly right.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's as
simple as it gets.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
At the same time
though, you still

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:84%
had people that
oversaw editorial

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.810 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to print
and also to Hollywood.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
ask you a question

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:90%
that popped into my head here.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
What about the movie "The
Day the Earth Stood Still?"

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: The
original version of it--

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.070 align:middle line:10%
well, there are two things.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:10%
What most people
don't know or very few

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:10%
have any ability to know is that
before the end of World War II

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:10%
one of these crafts
landed in Alaska,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:10%
and the four major leaders
were summoned to a meeting.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was FDR, Churchill,
Stalin, and de Gaulle.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And so some of that
type of interaction

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:90%
already had occurred.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:84%
When the movie "The Day the
Earth Stood Still" came out,

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
it was directed to the
actual contacts that were

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:90%
occurring or about to occur.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And it depicts 100% the
mentality of our politicians,

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
the mentality of our
military, the mentality

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.220 align:middle line:84%
of our general public, the
mentality of the media.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was instructive.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And I believe
it was specifically so.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that movie really was
a very concrete stepping stone

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to see how we would react
to that storyline being

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:90%
played out.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
interesting, because it's

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.311 align:middle line:84%
set apart from the other
storylines completely.

00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:12.111 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yeah.

00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
At '53, we had "Earth
Vs. the Flying Saucers,"

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and then everything
went crazy from there.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
so that storyline

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
was to incorporate the
fact that the people came

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:84%
amongst us looked like you
and I, could walk the streets.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:84%
As I already told you before
in a previous interview, when

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.310 align:middle line:84%
my father went before the
scientists and the scientists

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.805 align:middle line:84%
asked him, how many people
from other worlds do you know

00:20:34.805 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:84%
are walking amongst
us, my father

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:84%
wrote down a number
on a piece of paper,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and the scientist
wrote down his.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.468 align:middle line:84%
They exchanged numbers, and
they were practically the same.

00:20:42.468 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So they were aware that there
are those who come amongst us

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:90%
and spent a couple years.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like a Peace
Corps, two-year process

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:90%
in which they interact with us.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.125 align:middle line:84%
And they also learn some
things from us as well.

00:20:54.125 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:90%
And then they go back home.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.333 align:middle line:84%
I envy them because they
got a ticket out of here.

00:20:57.333 --> 00:20:59.577 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:59.577 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it is a little
crazy around these parts,

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.216 align:middle line:90%
especially today.

00:21:03.216 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yeah.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
in your book you're

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:90%
talking about men in black.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:90%
We kind of hit on this.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:84%
That was the old
way of interfacing.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.792 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you mentioned
earlier, you say no need.

00:21:14.792 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: There's no need.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do it to ourselves.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: In the early
'50s with the contacts,

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:28.220 align:middle line:84%
when the witnesses could not be
discouraged they were visited

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:90%
by these intelligence agents--

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --just
like George did.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.433 align:middle line:90%
And I mention it in the book.

00:21:32.433 --> 00:21:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And they came to him, and they
said, if you don't shut up,

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.808 align:middle line:84%
we're going to tie you
to the bumper of the car

00:21:36.808 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and drag you down the mountain
and so on and so forth.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And in his case,
he knew who they

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.585 align:middle line:84%
were because he had
been briefed beforehand

00:21:42.585 --> 00:21:43.835 align:middle line:90%
that this was going to happen.

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:45.002 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And who were they?

00:21:45.002 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They were
officers for the CIA.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And so he said to them,
I'll tell you what.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call
up the newspaper,

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'll give them your
commanding officer,

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:84%
the names of the agents,
and will reveal everything.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.828 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to have
a big storm on your hands.

00:22:02.828 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't
come back to them,

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.150 align:middle line:84%
because they knew from
that point on that

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
those who were supporting George
and his space contacts that

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.740 align:middle line:84%
came to warn him were
much more, shall we say,

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:84%
powerful than they
could ever be.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But on the whole,
the men in black

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.040 align:middle line:84%
were successful going among
some of the witnesses--

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --and
saying, hey, if you

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
don't do this, your children
or your grandchildren

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.024 align:middle line:84%
will be in danger
and what have you.

00:22:33.024 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:84%
What we have subjected
our own so-called citizens

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and populations to
is truly incredible.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we have.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:90%
It's criminal.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to what could have
been reasonable disclosure

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:90%
among the astronauts.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about Gordon Cooper.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about Neil Armstrong.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Gordon Cooper witnessed
UFOs while a combat officer

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:56.773 align:middle line:90%
over Germany.

00:22:56.773 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's go ahead and
talk about him.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.648 align:middle line:84%
And some people know his story,
but many people seeing this

00:23:00.648 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:84%
don't know Gordon
Cooper's story.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, let's
step one step further

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:90%
back than that.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
In '52 in July,
these flying saucers

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:84%
flew over the Capitol
of Washington--

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:84%
photographed over the White
House, over the Capitol.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
The military scrambled Shooting
Stars, the Lockheed Shooting

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.762 align:middle line:90%
Stars after them.

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't chase them,
couldn't catch them,

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:84%
couldn't shoot at them,
couldn't do anything.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, they're so fast.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yeah.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And shortly thereafter,
the government

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:90%
was going to divulge.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.680 align:middle line:84%
They printed about
120 million flyers

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
in which they were going to
divulge to the population

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and come out with
so-called disclosure.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What year again, '52?

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: '52.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:43.122 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Hoyt Vandenberg,
General Hoyt Vandenberg,

00:23:43.122 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Air Force Pentagon
chief of staff--

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yeah.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: --said no.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:90%
He nixed the entire thing.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And from that point forward,
that blockade continued to run.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
release of information,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:84%
we were on the verge of doing
it, but we decided not to.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But we didn't.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, remember,
this is a two-edged sword.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:84%
One, we'd come out
of World War II.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:90%
We were in a Cold War.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:90%
We're in nuclear arms race.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Next, they
weren't totally aware

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:84%
of what these crafts were,
and where they came from,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:90%
and their capabilities.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they could
have been out of Russia.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That's right.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:29.932 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing
is they are chartered.

00:24:29.932 --> 00:24:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Our government officials
and military officials

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:90%
are chartered to protect us.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And that protection is
left to their discretion

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:84%
in order to determine what that
protection is going to mean.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So in that particular
time and place,

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.620 align:middle line:84%
they determined that they
were going to protect us.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.097 align:middle line:84%
And the only way they knew how
to do that is to shut it down.

00:24:52.097 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so I mean,
that was their rationale.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.902 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: That
was their rationale.

00:24:54.902 --> 00:24:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to them,
it was sound thinking.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: For the moment.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For the moment, yeah.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.222 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Not for very long.

00:24:59.222 --> 00:25:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, quickly that
was peeled away.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Getting back to
Gordon Cooper, he

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
had seen these craft over
the European theater,

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.760 align:middle line:90%
and so had many other people.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
My parents saw these
motherships, and saucers,

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and foo fighters during
the war, World War II

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:84%
when they were
children in Berlin

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.810 align:middle line:90%
and the bombed-out cities.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And many of our squadron
commanders reported that too,

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that while they were
flying in B-17 formations

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:84%
these things were flying
along next to them.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And so Gordon Cooper
had seen that,

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and he was initially
vocal at what he had seen.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when you
look at the other astronauts,

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:84%
some of them reciprocated
that, being vocal as well,

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
but they were also
very cognizant

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.820 align:middle line:84%
of their military secrecy oath,
because all of these officers

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.860 align:middle line:90%
have to take an oath.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember the
legislation, there was a--

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.410 align:middle line:84%
it's written in the
book, I think [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:08.978 align:middle line:84%
18, that states that you
can go to jail for reporting

00:26:08.978 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:90%
this type of information.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
there's also another law

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:84%
that says that if you
have contact with aliens

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.775 align:middle line:90%
that you can go to jail as well.

00:26:17.775 --> 00:26:18.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:18.575 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: So how
do you get a law

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
that sends you to
jail for something

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:90%
they claim that doesn't exist?

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Doesn't exist.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so
Cooper was vocal.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:84%
There were others, of
course, many others that

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.612 align:middle line:84%
were vocal and became more
vocal as time came along.

00:26:31.612 --> 00:26:33.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Should I read one
of the statements you have--

00:26:33.945 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a quote
you have in your book.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:84%
He had said, "Intelligent
beings from other planets

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:84%
regularly enter our
world in an effort

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.420 align:middle line:90%
to enter into contact with us.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I've encountered various
ships during my space voyages.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:84%
NASA remains silent
to not alarm people."

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Is that why NASA remains
silent, you think?

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
it's threefold.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:10%
NASA's a government agency
that is administrated greatly

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:10%
by military, their military
officers and personnel

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:10%
that are running a
certain portion of NASA.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Some of it is chartered out.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a
political agency that

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
was responsible to
the vice president.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And so they are not
selected to tell you this.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.720 align:middle line:90%
That's not their function.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:84%
If they have information,
that information

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to go to either
their political overseers

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:84%
or military overseers
to see what information

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.750 align:middle line:90%
is going to be leaked forth.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:39.491 align:middle line:84%
They are not the primary agency
that makes that decision.

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's not in
their purview to do that, OK.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: And so thereby--

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I remember when my father
came back from NASA and the 22

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:90%
scientists, my mother as well.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
The scientists said, we have
got warehouses full of data

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that there is no time,
no budget, or money to be

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:90%
able to go through and discern.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And then as the
years went on, when

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:84%
we got our first-generation
copies from Apollo

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.870 align:middle line:84%
for the Moon, then
the scientists said,

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:84%
we don't even have the
equipment that came along

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.950 align:middle line:84%
with Mercury and
Gemini in order to go

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
through the process of going
through this material again.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So when my father was going
through the Moon pictures,

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.290 align:middle line:90%
they were supportive.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:90%
They said, heck, go and look.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:84%
See what you find,
and let that out.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what years
was that, during what years?

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: '67, my
father went to NASA

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and three months
thereafter Colonel Freeman

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:90%
from the Pentagon.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember any UFO
history in the late '50s,

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Freeman was
a very vocal advocate

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.280 align:middle line:90%
for letting the material out.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.240 align:middle line:84%
He was a good friend of
Captain Ruppelt, Major Berkow,

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.925 align:middle line:84%
and other officers who were
against this total suppression

00:28:58.925 --> 00:28:59.725 align:middle line:90%
of the material.

00:28:59.725 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And I describe their
meeting in the Pentagon

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:90%
that my father had.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at the
accumulation of material

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:84%
that has been
warehoused, I mean,

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.930 align:middle line:90%
there's an incredible amount.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's just not
to anybody's desire

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.200 align:middle line:90%
to try to access anymore.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a shame, but
it's the truth.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems
like it wouldn't

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
have sunk into
something as mundane

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.457 align:middle line:84%
as not bothering
to inquire anymore.

00:29:32.457 --> 00:29:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
because the budget.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the budget is
driven by public perception.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And the public were led
to believe that the space

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:84%
program was worthless,
where, in fact,

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
if you remember Hugh Downs,
who just passed away--

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --he
reported that there

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:84%
is a 4-to-1 return
for every dollar spent

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.663 align:middle line:84%
in the space program, which
is way better than the stock

00:29:57.663 --> 00:29:58.463 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:29:58.463 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
so we were supposed

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
to go from a military
and oil-based economy

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to a space-based
science economy,

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't take that
leap for obvious reasons.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so, so much
of the benefits of the space

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.060 align:middle line:84%
program have never been really
educated into the people.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I mean,
computerized wristwatches like

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:84%
the one from Apple, all
the Texas Instruments,

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:90%
the computers, the microwaves--

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.303 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you could go on and on--

00:30:32.303 --> 00:30:33.103 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:33.103 --> 00:30:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --of the
technological benefits

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.890 align:middle line:90%
from space.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so when the
people become ignorant and say,

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:39.900 align:middle line:90%
oh, why do we need to do that?

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:90%
We got problems on Earth.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's not spend money then--

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:84%
the budgets shrink smaller
and smaller to a point

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.190 align:middle line:84%
where they can barely
function, and now they

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.005 align:middle line:84%
have to farm it out to
private corporations.

00:30:51.005 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of topping off the
astronaut phase of this story--

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.410 align:middle line:84%
it was the same thing
with Neil Armstrong.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Neil Armstrong had also
told mission control, hey,

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing a couple
objects here.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And basically the CIA
covered that, told

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.605 align:middle line:90%
him hush up about that one.

00:31:09.605 --> 00:31:12.105 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, there's a
five-second transmission delay.

00:31:12.105 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yeah.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so that
gave some time in order

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:90%
to interrupt communications.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.130 align:middle line:84%
My information was that when
our astronauts got to the moon

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:24.400 align:middle line:84%
they found not only
extraterrestrial craft,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.720 align:middle line:90%
but space bases.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Not
only them, but ours.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, ours.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: So the first
step on the moon was a PR,

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.350 align:middle line:84%
but we had already
been there beforehand.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And this greatly impacted
Astronaut Armstrong.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And to some degree, he
shut down because he

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:55.732 align:middle line:84%
realized so much of what the
truth was would never go--

00:31:55.732 --> 00:31:56.732 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To the public.

00:31:56.732 --> 00:31:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: --to the public.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: What we
really would never go.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How disheartening.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: He became
very disheartened.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After everything he
had done and devoted his life

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:84%
to, it was never going
to be made public

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.690 align:middle line:90%
what was really going on.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That's right.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can understand that.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And I have to bring this up
because I saw it years ago,

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.442 align:middle line:90%
and I loved it.

00:32:12.442 --> 00:32:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
you think of it--

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Martin Stubbs, the
fellow up in BC

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.430 align:middle line:84%
that was running a little public
access television station who

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:25.840 align:middle line:84%
supposedly tapped into
the NASA transmission raw,

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.400 align:middle line:84%
so it didn't have any
five-second interrupt or delay.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:84%
The stuff floating around
out there in those images--

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:84%
if people haven't
seen it, I highly

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:84%
recommend people try to
find it wherever you can.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.880 align:middle line:84%
It's called the "Secret
Space Transmissions."

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.700 align:middle line:84%
What are your
thoughts on that film?

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Well, I remember--

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't seen the film that
you're speaking about recently,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.943 align:middle line:90%
so it's a bit back in my memory.

00:32:54.943 --> 00:32:56.901 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I haven't
for a long time either.

00:32:56.901 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:84%
I just remember the shape of
these things moving in and out

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.170 align:middle line:84%
of view that we never saw
on the NASA transmissions.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Well, never, no.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that
Maurice Chatelain, who

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:84%
wrote the book "Our Ancestors
Came from Outer Space," who

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:84%
was the patent holder for
the Apollo telecommunication

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:17.350 align:middle line:84%
system, spoke explicitly
about every astronaut mission

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
being accompanied
by UFOs and also

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
being transmitted music into
the command module as well.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
very aware of that.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
multiple frequencies.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And so as in
Armstrong's case he was

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:84%
told switch to this frequency,
switch to this frequency

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
so that it could not be
so readily intercepted.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so
that's another reason

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:84%
why I am so adamant about
proving that we never

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.140 align:middle line:84%
faked the moon mission,
because I have the proof.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.870 align:middle line:84%
I have the first-generation
photographs.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:03.130 align:middle line:10%
When you look at this
material, it is--

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.500 align:middle line:10%
the faking the
Moon landing is all

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:10%
based upon a premise
of certain things--

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.840 align:middle line:10%
why the flag is waving,
or why this is happening?

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.020 align:middle line:90%
So it had to be in a studio.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.969 align:middle line:84%
But when you study
the information that

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:19.389 align:middle line:84%
has come out about the
Moon, we have learned

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:21.250 align:middle line:90%
there is a lunar atmosphere.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.469 align:middle line:84%
There is lunar
atmospheric pressure.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:25.750 align:middle line:90%
There are clouds and mists.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.630 align:middle line:84%
There are moving lights
and moving objects.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So the flag waving had to do
with the atmospheric pressure

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:35.380 align:middle line:84%
on the moon, the pressure
gradient, flapping that flag.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to
do with the studio.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
Astronaut Young,

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:44.139 align:middle line:84%
he can only jump about 20 inches
with his full astronaut pack.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:46.090 align:middle line:84%
That's because
mathematically it's

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.889 align:middle line:84%
proven that the
gravity of the Moon

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:52.420 align:middle line:84%
is 64% that of
Earth, not one sixth.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:90%
That is a pure fallacy.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you understand
the true conditions

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.070 align:middle line:84%
of what is on the moon,
then you don't come up

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.950 align:middle line:84%
with these unbelievable
leaps of fantasy

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:06.790 align:middle line:84%
to say that the moon mission
is filmed in a studio.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it's another one of these
sensationalistic promotions

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:19.060 align:middle line:84%
by the UFO community
to drum up profit,

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.300 align:middle line:84%
but they have nothing behind
it other than their sheer

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.123 align:middle line:90%
ignorance of the conditions.

00:35:24.123 --> 00:35:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let
me ask you this.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.745 align:middle line:84%
Which book features that
information about the moon?

00:35:28.745 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: My father's book,
"Alien Bases on the Moon."

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.260 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to get the name of
it so people can look it up.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.390 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: It's "We Discovered
Alien Bases on the Moon."

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:10%
It came out in 1981.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.100 align:middle line:90%
I revised it in 1997.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when were
the photographs taken?

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: The lunar pictures
were all taken by Apollo.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:47.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, by Apollo.

00:35:47.805 --> 00:35:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
so what happened

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.630 align:middle line:84%
is one of the scientists
said to my father,

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.880 align:middle line:84%
if you write to this
and this department

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:84%
you can get microfiche and
microfilm of the missions

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.010 align:middle line:90%
that you request.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to cost you,
because it's not for free.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:90%
So my father said no problem.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So he picked specifics of
what he wanted, and I still

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.220 align:middle line:84%
have the pictures in
my safe, and I still

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.560 align:middle line:90%
have the microfilm in my safe.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And you could order
those pictures.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Some of them came--

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.240 align:middle line:84%
about 15 by 11
Hasselblad pictures.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And there, you could go
through those photographs,

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and you could see clouds and
mist hanging over craters

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:90%
casting a shadow.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.050 align:middle line:84%
You could see
constructed devices

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.120 align:middle line:90%
hanging between canyons.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.950 align:middle line:84%
This is all stuff that
was reported already

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:90%
for the last 100 years.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
chronological listing

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
of the lunar
atmospheric conditions

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.060 align:middle line:84%
that NASA put out
in '67, Middlehurst,

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:50.810 align:middle line:84%
it lists for the last 100
years exactly the same things.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look
at what has happened

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:84%
on the moon and the same type
of environment that George

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.665 align:middle line:84%
Adamski already
described in 1955 when

00:36:58.665 --> 00:37:00.332 align:middle line:84%
he flew around the
moon and the saucer--

00:37:00.332 --> 00:37:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --you will notice
that the conditions that life

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
promotes is the same
regardless of where you go,

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.700 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Earth, the
moon, the backside of Venus,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.670 align:middle line:84%
the moons of Titan
and Saturn, wherever.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Life constructs under the same
parameters and principles,

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.310 align:middle line:90%
doesn't change.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:90%
It is a constant.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank god it's not run by us,
because we'd mess it all up.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Indeed.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: All right,
so you see these things.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: So in '71,
Apollo left instrumentation

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:90%
that measured water geysers.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And they measured--
and I have the report.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:41.380 align:middle line:84%
For 14 hours, water
geysers spraying out

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.120 align:middle line:90%
of the lunar surface.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.790 align:middle line:84%
People said, what,
water on the moon--

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.560 align:middle line:90%
in 1990.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.630 align:middle line:90%
They left 40 years in between.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell
you, oh, guess what?

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:52.810 align:middle line:90%
We found water on the Moon.

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, you already
found it in 1971.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: It's basically the
same information given to you

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:84%
again to see how the
public will react.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Will they show any more
concern or interest

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:07.890 align:middle line:90%
now as they did then?

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And they found out
no, they don't.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They're too busy with all
the other peripheral stuff.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.040 align:middle line:90%
They could care less.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So we have built
ourselves a dilemma.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.770 align:middle line:90%


00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me ask you about
this, the Silver Springs film

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:26.950 align:middle line:84%
sequence, OK, since
we're sticking

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:29.130 align:middle line:90%
with things that can be proven.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about the
Silver Springs film sequence.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: February of
1965, George had come back

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.480 align:middle line:84%
a month earlier from New
York City with U Thant, where

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.030 align:middle line:84%
he was offered a seat
on the United Nations.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.100 align:middle line:90%
And George turned it down.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And we ask him, why
did you do that?

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because if I take
an official position I would

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.680 align:middle line:84%
thereby be told what
I can and cannot say.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:90%
And he says, I don't do that.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.160 align:middle line:90%
So he politely declined that.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me
say this right now.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So for anybody that hasn't
watched our previous interview,

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, to go and take a peek
at it because it gives

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot of background on
George Adamski, as I said,

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:84%
a gentleman, it seems to
me, a very high integrity

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:15.570 align:middle line:90%
in intelligence.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I highly recommend people
watch our previous interview--

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: I do too.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to
set this story up,

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.050 align:middle line:84%
because we're not going to do
the whole thing over again.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: So in
February of '65 a few days

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:84%
before the famous Silver
Springs UFO footage was taken,

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle line:84%
couple spacemen
came to the house.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your house?

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:36.925 align:middle line:90%
Whose house?

00:39:36.925 --> 00:39:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: To Madeleine's
house, where we all were

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.642 align:middle line:90%
staying, the road of her house.

00:39:39.642 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, at
Madeleine's house.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.995 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: In Silver Springs.

00:39:40.995 --> 00:39:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was George
staying there at that time?

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: George
stayed there.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.650 align:middle line:90%
We stayed there.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Everybody stayed there
whenever George came into town.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And two of them
came to the house

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and sat down on the
dining room table,

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and told him, on this and
this day at this and this time

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.530 align:middle line:90%
we are planning this maneuver.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.750 align:middle line:84%
First will come a remote
control registering

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.900 align:middle line:84%
disk that will measure the
distance between the trees,

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and thereafter
will come the scout

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.610 align:middle line:84%
craft about 100 feet
from the camera lens

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:07.830 align:middle line:90%
and do the exact same maneuvers.

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:11.340 align:middle line:84%
However, the scout craft will
also extend and retract one

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.060 align:middle line:84%
of the three-ball condensers
that is underneath the craft--

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.550 align:middle line:90%
and so to be ready.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is a normal
sequence of events

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:84%
because these type of activities
don't happen haphazardly.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.900 align:middle line:90%
It's arranged.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.230 align:middle line:10%
So a few days later,
George and Madeleine

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:middle line:10%
were standing out on the front
porch and get ready to film.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.740 align:middle line:10%
And he handed her the
camera, and he said,

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.425 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to be the only one
who always takes UFO footage.

00:40:42.425 --> 00:40:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Other people need
to take it too.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.660 align:middle line:90%
And of course, many have.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But Madeleine did not
know how to use a camera.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:middle line:90%
She had never filmed.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.450 align:middle line:84%
In the old days
with these cameras,

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.570 align:middle line:84%
you have to literally
count 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.678 align:middle line:84%
If you move too quickly,
you pan too quickly,

00:40:56.678 --> 00:40:57.720 align:middle line:90%
then everything's a blur.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all distorted.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: And it's distorted.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And he saw that she
didn't know how to use it.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So he took the camera from
her to film the sequence.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:06.240 align:middle line:10%
And lo and behold
came the registering

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.080 align:middle line:10%
just skipping over the trees,
moving between the trees.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Doing
measurements, so to speak.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.372 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: Doing
measurements, yes.

00:41:12.372 --> 00:41:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
difference between

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.160 align:middle line:84%
a 2-foot-long registering or
remote-controlled disk of what

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.580 align:middle line:84%
we would use now as
a drone and a saucer

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that's about 33
feet in diameter.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.353 align:middle line:90%
And so that was filmed.

00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I supplied
you the pictures

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.470 align:middle line:84%
with that where you can see the
frame-by-frame analysis that

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:84%
shows the registering just
moving behind the trees.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So this has once more
given the skeptics

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.030 align:middle line:90%
a slap upside the face.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Next came the scout craft, which
came skipping along the trees

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and then moved into the
area in front of the house.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The film was analyzed by Bill
Sherwood from Eastman Kodak.

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the craft
moving side to side.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.450 align:middle line:84%
There is an elongation
effect of the hull that

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is coming from the
propulsion system,

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:84%
because the propulsion system
is electromagnetic and goes

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:84%
through the skin, like
the pores of your skin.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And it causes a slight
radiation effect.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And so consequently not
only is the craft moving,

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.280 align:middle line:84%
there's distortion on the
side of the hull, which

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.350 align:middle line:84%
proves it's not
a model, and then

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:16.050 align:middle line:84%
moving back and forth
the three-ball condenser.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is it moved right

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.010 align:middle line:84%
over the top of your
head as George filmed it

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.020 align:middle line:84%
over the top of the
house and was gone.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that film was
developed within 24 hours.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.413 align:middle line:84%
My father, my mother,
Nelson, Madeleine's husband,

00:42:30.413 --> 00:42:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Madeleine, George, and
myself sat in the living room

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.600 align:middle line:90%
and watched it.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.350 align:middle line:90%
It was intact 100%--

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.492 align:middle line:90%
beautiful, beautiful.

00:42:38.492 --> 00:42:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And the only piece
that was taken from it

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.070 align:middle line:84%
was the piece when it goes
across the top of your head,

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:84%
because it shows the
rings oscillating

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
flange of the craft.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.522 align:middle line:84%
And it showed too much
of the propulsion system.

00:42:51.522 --> 00:42:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the space
people told George

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:84%
that they were worried that
they would be analyzing that

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.800 align:middle line:84%
in order to divulge
propulsion systems,

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:90%
so they asked for that back.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And he cut that off
and gave it to them.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But there were two
frames surviving.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at Rene Olsen's
book "The George Adamski

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Story," he found
those two frames,

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and he put them
in there as well.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And so my father arranged for an
international press conference

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:20.700 align:middle line:84%
on March 13 of 1965 at
the Mayflower Hotel.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And all the major
networks were there.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.860 align:middle line:10%
And they showed that film
along with the other films

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.940 align:middle line:10%
that George had--

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:10%
the Wisconsin footage where
the craft moves back and forth

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:33.860 align:middle line:10%
and forward and back at
high velocities, stopping,

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.930 align:middle line:10%
90-degree turns, the
one from Mexico which

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.480 align:middle line:10%
shows the craft as it
appears behind the trees.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so consequently,
shall we say

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:45.230 align:middle line:90%
that the media was astounded.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And there was
also the diplomatic staff,

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.170 align:middle line:84%
because my mother had
mailed all the invitations

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.800 align:middle line:84%
to the diplomatic staff of all
the embassies in Washington

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.600 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So there were a
certain amount of them.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:84%
George was to pass away just
shortly after his 73rd birthday

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:90%
in late April.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And so the story continued.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So today, as we're
moving on in this talk,

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:16.210 align:middle line:84%
those days were the days
where you had real evidence.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.190 align:middle line:90%
You had serious researchers.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:22.990 align:middle line:84%
You had amazing witnesses
who were an integrity.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:27.730 align:middle line:84%
George even went so far as--
as I recall, he put it out

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that he would pay if
someone could disprove what?

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: There was,
I believe, a $10,000--

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A reward.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --offer
or reward for anyone

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:43.060 align:middle line:84%
who thought they
could positively

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.870 align:middle line:84%
show that any of the
material was fake.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.100 align:middle line:90%
And none of it was ever proven.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.870 align:middle line:90%
None of it was ever taken.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one got the reward.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So it was in a day
where there was still--

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:58.510 align:middle line:84%
even though this political
decision to split off happened,

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:01.090 align:middle line:84%
there was still a lot of
integrity in the movement.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And today, as we spoke about
earlier on, not so much.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Where can we find some
integrity in research today,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and how can we tell
the pretenders?

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I wouldn't say
that there is not integrity.

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it is a
little bit more buried.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:30.730 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I talk about having
a meeting in the Southwest

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:34.600 align:middle line:84%
sponsored by several well-known
scientists in which we

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.080 align:middle line:84%
had a three-day
symposium and all of them

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.280 align:middle line:90%
experts in their field.

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I also relate
the story of being

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.960 align:middle line:84%
at one of the doctors'
house in the evening,

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.140 align:middle line:84%
because he had arranged for
some of the laboratory people

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.433 align:middle line:84%
to come and have an
evening cocktail party,

00:45:56.433 --> 00:45:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and to talk about the
subject, to look at the films,

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And so he said to me-- we're
standing out on the balcony

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.120 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, people
have such little knowledge

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:16.190 align:middle line:84%
or recognition of what an
immensely amazing creation

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:19.700 align:middle line:90%
the human form is.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:25.400 align:middle line:84%
All the capabilities
are given to us

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:35.630 align:middle line:84%
to conceive, and to produce,
and to use immense technology.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:39.980 align:middle line:84%
He says, try taking a
finger away and then trying

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.400 align:middle line:90%
to build a computer board.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:47.010 align:middle line:84%
It becomes 10 times
more difficult.

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.830 align:middle line:84%
He says, most
certainly no creature

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:52.070 align:middle line:84%
with a claw that climbed out
of the ocean that has now

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:55.280 align:middle line:84%
been either called a crustacean,
praying mantis, reptilian,

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.400 align:middle line:84%
or any of these other
fictitious descriptions

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.520 align:middle line:84%
can possibly have
the intelligence

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and the capabilities
to produce spaceships.

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:12.740 align:middle line:84%
He says, we have such a
sad lack of recognition

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.687 align:middle line:84%
of what our abilities are
and how we came about them.

00:47:15.687 --> 00:47:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is so true.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And as I recall, in
Adamski's book, he was shown

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and it was explained to him
that this is the dominant form

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.190 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:30.800 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands, if
not hundreds of thousands

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.210 align:middle line:84%
of planets, that are populated
with the humanoid species.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: There
are different races,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.570 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
different species.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And I remember hearing
somebody said, well,

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:46.970 align:middle line:84%
the US government is in contact
with 150 species from space.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Nonsense.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolute nonsense.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: According
to Adamski, know

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.780 align:middle line:84%
this is the most used, most
developed, and evolved form,

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.968 align:middle line:90%
is what we now are as humans.

00:47:58.968 --> 00:48:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: It's just
not Adamski who said that.

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:03.470 align:middle line:84%
When you look at some of the
other authors I mentioned,

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:05.540 align:middle line:84%
they say they have
narrowed it down to four--

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:10.070 align:middle line:84%
human, humanoid,
robotic, and android.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what you have.

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things that
people are seeing either

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.110 align:middle line:84%
fall under the robotic
or android form,

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.030 align:middle line:84%
but they're not biological,
sentient beings.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And there's a great difference.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this
fallacy that intelligence,

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:37.070 align:middle line:84%
intellectuality, cognizance
changes our outer form.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Refinement comes about, true,
but those characteristics

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:45.445 align:middle line:90%
come from within us.

00:48:45.445 --> 00:48:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
this is something

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.960 align:middle line:90%
George was also saying.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Venusians in
particular also physically

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.060 align:middle line:90%
appear--

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.080 align:middle line:84%
they have more refined
their societies.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.760 align:middle line:90%
They've refined their emotions.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And they also have a more
refined and beautiful physical

00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.180 align:middle line:90%
appearance.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: True,
because like for instance,

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:04.670 align:middle line:84%
here on this planet
we don't use robotics.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
if we used robotics

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:12.350 align:middle line:84%
to do highway construction
or all of these what we call

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.920 align:middle line:84%
hard and physical manual
labor, which does cause

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.170 align:middle line:90%
an immense amount of strain--

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wear and tear.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --and stress, and
wear and tear on our bodies,

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:24.260 align:middle line:84%
if we alleviate that and allow
ourselves to do other things,

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.120 align:middle line:84%
then you see a
greater refinement.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Look, for instance,
look at the people

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:34.280 align:middle line:84%
who are ballerinas or are in
these particular endeavors

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.145 align:middle line:84%
where they have over time
refined their physical form.

00:49:37.145 --> 00:49:38.937 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beautiful
athletes, their bodies.

00:49:38.937 --> 00:49:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Beautiful
athletes, things like that.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And so they have learned
not to do things by extreme.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is the greatest
cause of destruction

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:48.560 align:middle line:84%
of the human form
from the outside.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm going
tangential here,

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:54.830 align:middle line:84%
but it would be nice
to be able to speak

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:57.558 align:middle line:84%
with a civilization
who's been through what

00:49:57.558 --> 00:49:59.600 align:middle line:84%
we've been through, what
we're going through now.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Because what's really
being demanded of us

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is to find a new economic model
for our planet at this time.

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:09.500 align:middle line:84%
This has already happened
in other civilizations.

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Because when you were talking
a moment ago, I would say,

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.890 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, more job-- if
you're listening as a human--

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.200 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, more jobs
disappearing to robots.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
fighting against.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:23.150 align:middle line:84%
But no, there are
other models of being

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:28.100 align:middle line:84%
able to sustain ourselves and
not just survive, but thrive

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.140 align:middle line:84%
outside of this
industrial model.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Because we
do not respect each other.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: So if I am going
to replace an industry with

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.900 align:middle line:84%
robotics, I must at
the same time provide--

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --avenues of
employment and expression

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:48.837 align:middle line:84%
for those who are
displaced out of that.

00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: For instance, why
would I not send a robot in

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:57.330 align:middle line:84%
to fight fires instead of humans
who often die in the endeavor

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and then take those people
who are firefighters,

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and give them the
avenues to express

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.710 align:middle line:90%
based upon their own talent?

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:03.845 --> 00:51:05.262 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: But
we don't do that.

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:06.380 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.550 align:middle line:90%
We discard people.

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we discard
people is because we

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.760 align:middle line:90%
are an overpopulated planet.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.930 align:middle line:84%
The entire foundation
of our problems

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:21.872 align:middle line:84%
comes from one thing
only, overpopulation.

00:51:21.872 --> 00:51:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The only
thing is, Glenn,

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.480 align:middle line:84%
we disrespected each other
prior to overpopulation.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: True, but
the consequences of that

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.040 align:middle line:90%
overpopulation--

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:34.790 align:middle line:84%
the compression, the usage
of natural resources,

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:37.160 align:middle line:84%
the availability of
food and medicine--

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.850 align:middle line:84%
this irresponsible
constantly overpopulation

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:44.270 align:middle line:84%
has put us in a position where
we are basically dog on dog

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:47.660 align:middle line:84%
at the throat because
pretty soon we run out.

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would argue
our irresponsible use of what

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.150 align:middle line:90%
we are given and what we have.

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:54.858 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's, to
me, the key problem,

00:51:54.858 --> 00:51:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is a lack of intelligent,
clear thinking.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: We
have to move forward

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:09.230 align:middle line:84%
by providing interim
opportunities instead

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:10.130 align:middle line:90%
of a vacuum.

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:12.418 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:52:12.418 --> 00:52:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how we're going to
come about or make it happen,

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.440 align:middle line:84%
but as I said, if it were a
wish that could be fulfilled

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.532 align:middle line:84%
it'd be wonderful to have
a summit with species

00:52:20.532 --> 00:52:22.490 align:middle line:84%
from elsewhere who've
been through this, who've

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.520 align:middle line:84%
developed these models for
thriving, not just surviving.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
they've been coming here

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:27.440 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're ignoring
them or shooting them down.

00:52:29.827 --> 00:52:30.062 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
we're ignoring them.

00:52:30.062 --> 00:52:33.740 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of years they've
come historically amongst us

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.910 align:middle line:90%
to show us a better way of life.

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at this
other side of this.

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:42.230 align:middle line:84%
If I constantly come to you and
say, Regina, what you're doing

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:45.780 align:middle line:84%
is self-destructive, and
it's not good for you,

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and you can see yourself and
feel the consequences of what

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:52.820 align:middle line:84%
you do, and if you say, go
away, I like what I'm doing,

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.215 align:middle line:90%
so who's the fool?

00:52:54.215 --> 00:52:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] I agree.

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: So after
a while they go,

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:58.010 align:middle line:90%
and they move somewhere else.

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we are one speck of
sand on a beach full of sand.

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And if they are not
wanted here, there

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:11.990 align:middle line:84%
are trillions of other places
to go where they may be wanted.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Only a fool wastes their
energy and purpose.

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.797 align:middle line:90%
And so here we are.

00:53:19.797 --> 00:53:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we get to figure out these
challenges for ourselves.

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But I'm glad you just
simply touched on

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.650 align:middle line:84%
that, because that's one of the
things that Adamski brought up,

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:32.600 align:middle line:84%
was the beauty and the grace
that filled the cultures that

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.012 align:middle line:84%
emanated all the
way through even

00:53:34.012 --> 00:53:35.720 align:middle line:84%
to their physical
appearance because they

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.690 align:middle line:84%
didn't abuse themselves
and wear themselves out.

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.600 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we're talking
about one specific culture,

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.973 align:middle line:90%
people on Venus.

00:53:43.973 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Not the only
ones that he talked about.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And tell us a couple
more that he talked about

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.350 align:middle line:90%
before we say goodbye here.

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: He talked about the
people who are living on Venus.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the first
thing everybody says, oh--

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.020 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
UFO community, if you

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.198 align:middle line:84%
talk about life in
this solar system,

00:54:02.198 --> 00:54:03.740 align:middle line:84%
they pooh-hoo it as
hard as they can.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.863 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
they do it on purpose

00:54:05.863 --> 00:54:08.660 align:middle line:84%
because they know by going to
a far distant place, the less

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.020 align:middle line:84%
likelihood of being
contradicted in what they say.

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So I sent you that
picture from Mariner 10.

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: It shows Venus
with a cloud, and blue layers,

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:20.635 align:middle line:90%
and two polar ice caps--

00:54:20.635 --> 00:54:21.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:21.435 --> 00:54:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --the only
picture of that that

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:25.050 align:middle line:90%
was released to the public.

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you
have polar ice caps

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.930 align:middle line:84%
if it's 800 degrees
like they claim?

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the discontinuity
between what we have been told

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and what actually
exists is huge.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.555 align:middle line:84%
So George talked about
civilizations on Venus.

00:54:38.555 --> 00:54:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it interesting
that some of our science

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:42.055 align:middle line:84%
talked about, well,
there may have been

00:54:42.055 --> 00:54:43.580 align:middle line:90%
ancient civilizations there?

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So we agreed to the fact
that it was inhabitable

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:47.330 align:middle line:90%
perhaps at one time.

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:49.577 align:middle line:84%
They say the same
thing about Mars.

00:54:49.577 --> 00:54:51.410 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, well, two
billion years ago we

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:53.120 align:middle line:90%
had water and civilizations.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.400 align:middle line:84%
But yet they teach
the law of evolution,

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.415 align:middle line:84%
which says you have
to go one billion,

00:54:57.415 --> 00:54:58.790 align:middle line:84%
two billion, three
billion, four,

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and now we've reached the
point where we are on Earth.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.870 align:middle line:84%
But if we go to another
planet, then all

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:04.175 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden this whole--

00:55:04.175 --> 00:55:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It reverses their--

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: The
discontinuity is ridiculous.

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So he talked about people on
Mars, he talked about Jupiter,

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and he talked about Saturn.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he talked about
places like Neptune as well.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I can only say
that out of that litany,

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I have run across individuals
from four of those places.

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And tell us just--

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:29.600 align:middle line:84%
this is fun-- the
characteristics from each one

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.930 align:middle line:84%
that you could glean
from the people you met.

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: The
people from Venus--

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and there's a reason why
there's an association

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.730 align:middle line:84%
with ancient mythology
for these planets--

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Mars, the god of war, and so on.

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:46.910 align:middle line:84%
People of Venus are working
to refine themselves,

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and to live in peace
and tranquility,

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and to travel the cosmos,
and educate themselves

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:57.260 align:middle line:90%
with truth, not this fiction.

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't theorize
about anything.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.230 align:middle line:90%
They want to know.

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:02.630 align:middle line:84%
They go to the place,
and they record the data,

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.410 align:middle line:90%
and see it for themselves.

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And so unlike here, where
we have astrophysicists

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that come up with
whatever theory

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.750 align:middle line:84%
pops in their mind
for this time,

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:14.540 align:middle line:84%
like Hawkings, and hasn't
got an ounce of truth to it.

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
type of individual

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:20.525 align:middle line:84%
that comes from
there, or individuals.

00:56:20.525 --> 00:56:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where else?

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.255 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple minutes
left, but I want to hear it.

00:56:24.255 --> 00:56:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: From
Jupiter we have

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:29.650 align:middle line:84%
people who are representing
the black arts, black magic.

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Each planet has its own symbol.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Venus has the curved S. Mars
has the lightning bolts.

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter has the
five-pointed star.

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Saturn has the
scales of equality.

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And you will find that
in our own mythology.

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.637 align:middle line:90%
You have that from Egypt.

00:56:45.637 --> 00:56:46.720 align:middle line:90%
You have that from Israel.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.170 align:middle line:84%
You have that from
World War II Germany.

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And that represents those
who have come to influence

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.360 align:middle line:90%
those societies as well.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Those societies copied
those insignias.

00:56:57.730 --> 00:56:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So black
magic from Jupiter.

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And Mars
is a group of people

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.190 align:middle line:84%
who are more, shall
we say, like to play

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.386 align:middle line:90%
games, mind-manipulative games.

00:57:08.386 --> 00:57:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of tricksters.

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Tricksters only
to see if you will fall for it.

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.940 align:middle line:84%
In other words, all
of these societies

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.390 align:middle line:84%
that travel space are
not foolish enough

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to cause you physical
harm, whether they're

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.400 align:middle line:84%
so-called good ones or
bad ones, because they

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.100 align:middle line:84%
know there is a
common law of karma

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:30.700 align:middle line:84%
or a common law of what you set
in motion comes back to you.

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're not stupid
to pay that price.

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So they're not coming
here to abduct you.

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:37.240 align:middle line:84%
They're not coming
here to torture you

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.970 align:middle line:84%
or to cut you up because
they know that law of karma

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:41.680 align:middle line:90%
will come directly back to them.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're smart enough
to say hell no, I'm

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:45.370 align:middle line:90%
not paying that price.

00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But if I can make you do things
to yourself by being agreeable

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.280 align:middle line:84%
or to your weaknesses,
then they laugh.

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And the people from Mars
are those kind of people.

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:56.745 --> 00:57:58.662 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And there
are a lot of them here.

00:57:58.662 --> 00:58:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, what's
the fourth one?

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.095 align:middle line:90%
You said there were four.

00:58:01.095 --> 00:58:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Oh,
that Saturn was--

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Saturn.

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --the
law of equality.

00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:09.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the most advanced
planet in this system.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:14.890 align:middle line:10%
And those people are
purpose in motion.

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:17.710 align:middle line:84%
They don't do
anything haphazardly.

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.210 align:middle line:90%
They are never bored.

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:24.640 align:middle line:10%
For them, life, being a part
of life, the creative force,

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:27.900 align:middle line:10%
is everything and
that understanding.

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And that allows them
to do many things

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that the other people on
other planets can't go.

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.282 align:middle line:84%
And all of them show
up in human form?

00:58:35.282 --> 00:58:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: All of them
show up in human form.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our cosmos.

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.110 align:middle line:84%
We are out of time, but I
want to say thank you so

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:44.140 align:middle line:84%
much for not only
carrying forward

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Adamski and your father's work,
but for continuing on your own.

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:50.240 align:middle line:84%
You're your own
warrior in this area.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice to have a sane
conversation around this topic

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:56.210 align:middle line:84%
instead of something that's
competitive and salacious as it

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:57.010 align:middle line:90%
often is.

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:57.885 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: I agree.

00:58:57.885 --> 00:59:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate your
interview, and your questions,

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and your capabilities
of doing that.

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways I feel
like the last man standing,

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.640 align:middle line:90%
but, eh, that's OK.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's OK.

00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Just keep standing.

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you again.

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Thank you, Regina.

>>REGINA: Again, Glenn's
new book is titled "The UFO

Can Truth Prevail?"

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:17.713 align:middle line:10%
which you can find
at major booksellers.
