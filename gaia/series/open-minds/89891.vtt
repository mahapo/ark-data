>>REGINA MEREDITH: Welcome
to "Open Minds: On the Road."

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.940 align:middle line:84%
We're here in Joshua
Tree, California

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.280 align:middle line:90%
at Contact in the Desert.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280 align:middle line:10%
In a moment, I'm going to be
speaking with Robert Salas.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.129 align:middle line:10%
During his career
in the military,

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.800 align:middle line:10%
he witnessed nuclear silos
being shut down one by one

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.202 align:middle line:10%
while a UFO hovered overhead.

[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:24.662 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Robert, I'm glad to finally
have a chance to chat with you.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, I think
it was early 2001,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:90%
I was at Disclosure.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And I originally met you at
Steven Greer's Disclosure

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
at the National Press
Club in Washington DC,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and what a powerful
event that was.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT SALAS: It really was.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:90%
It really was.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's when
I first heard your story,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:90%
and that was 13 years ago.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've always wanted
to interview you.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, your
story exemplifies

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:84%
what it's going to take to bring
the average person that really

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
can't conceive of this into the
fold, because it's undeniable.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've
referred to "it,"

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
why don't we start with your
story, what you were doing,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:84%
your position in the military,
the time, everything.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Just tell us your story.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Well, in 1967, I was
a first lieutenant in the Air

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Force, and I was stationed
in Malmstrom Air Force

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:90%
Base, Montana.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:10%
I was a missile
launch officer, which

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:10%
means there was a
crew of two of us

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:10%
that went to the underground
facilities located

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.056 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of a
wheat field in Montana.

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean
really obscure, right?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Right.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
no one would know

00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
that that's where all the
activity during the Cold War

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.349 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Well, yes.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.570 align:middle line:10%
We had some pretty
deadly weapons there.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.471 align:middle line:10%
Of course, these were nuclear
weapons, the Minuteman I

00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:10%
missile.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.254 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was the
range of the Minutemen?

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Refresh us on what
was going and--

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: OK.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.842 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.842 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of this,
even today, I really

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:84%
should not talk about too
much, as far as targeting.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
But let's say the
range of the missile

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
was far enough to
target our known enemies

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
at the time, our
strategic enemies.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.874 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this
was during the Cold War,

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:25.860 align:middle line:84%
so I think we understand
what that means.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: This was during
the Cold War, Vietnam War.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.673 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:28.673 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, you're out there.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And these are dotted
all over Montana,

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:90%
these silos facilities?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Yes.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We had 15 of these launch
control facilities,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
each with 10 missiles--
controlling 10 missiles,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:90%
so that's 150 missiles.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
We had- These
missiles were located

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
in kind of a ring around the
launch control facility itself.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were the locals aware
of what these facilities were?

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Oh, yes.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
people in Montana knew.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.361 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Yes.

00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Because obviously,
we had the construction crews

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:84%
come in first and make big
ditches in their wheat fields.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.206 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: So yeah, they knew.

00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:11.040 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.615 align:middle line:10%
So the story we're
going to talk about

00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:20.040 align:middle line:10%
is-- happened to me
on March 24, 1967.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
My commander Fred Mywald
and I were on duty

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.950 align:middle line:84%
at Oscar Flight, which is about
100 miles east of Great Falls,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:84%
near a little town
called Roy, Montana.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Sometime in the evening,
after it was dark--

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and I can't remember whether
it was early in the morning--

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think it was
early in the morning-- I

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:84%
get a call from
my topside guard.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying, well, sir,
we've been-- the guards

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and I have been out
looking at the stars,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and we've been seeing some
strange, flying objects

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:84%
up here, going at high
speeds, stopping on a dime,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.690 align:middle line:84%
reversing course,
making 90 degree turns,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:90%
not making any sounds.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at
very high speeds?

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.806 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Very high
speeds, very strange.

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.415 align:middle line:84%
And they're not any kind of
aircraft that we know of.

00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And I even said,
you mean like UFOs?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, sir,
we can't explain them,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:90%
and I just wanted to report it.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.607 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for your report.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, where were you?

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.585 align:middle line:84%
You say he was topside, so that
indicates you were not topside.

00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.168 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: No, I'm sorry.

00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I was 60 feet underground in
a hardened, concrete and steel

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:90%
capsule.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.147 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
extremely secure, I take it.

00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Extremely secure.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, with
that many missiles,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
it should be extremely secure.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Yeah,
supposedly, we were

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:84%
able to withstand a
nuclear blast overhead.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: So this was a very
secure facility obviously.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is this where
the controls for the silo

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
are located,
underneath the ground?

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: The controls
for all the missiles

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:90%
were all located underground.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
They had no controls
topside or ground level.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just setting the stage
for what's going to happen.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.315 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Right.

00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is important point
because the first thing people

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to want to think
is this was kind of a hoax.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:84%
It was perpetrated by
those guys upstairs.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:90%
It was not.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this
first phone call,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I basically hung up
on him, thanked him.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you know,
it's a little strange.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:90%
This guy's a professional.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I knew the guard, and he
was always very straight

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and did not joke around,
things like that.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So I thought are these guys
trying to kid me, or what?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to my book, and
then five minutes or so later,

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.140 align:middle line:90%
I get another call.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
This time, the same guard
is screaming into the phone,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:90%
and he's obviously frightened.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:90%
He's yelling into the phone.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:90%
He's not speaking his words.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:90%
He's yelling them.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we've got
all the guards out here.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.825 align:middle line:84%
They've all got
their weapons drawn.

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking out
the front window,

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and I see this
glowing, red object

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that's elongated, oval-shaped,
pulsating red-orange light,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:84%
hovering just above
the front gate.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:90%
No noise.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.039 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely silent.

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.205 align:middle line:90%
And they're scared to death.

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, recently I got
a report from someone,

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
which I have to validate--
but I'll mention it--

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that one of the guards
did fire his weapon at it.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are other cases,
which I could mention later,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:84%
where weapons were fired at
these things to no avail.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, of
course not, but I

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.687 align:middle line:84%
guess it's an
instinctive response

00:06:58.687 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:90%
if you're in the military.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Right.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted me to tell
him what to do next.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I was shocked.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to tell him.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.556 align:middle line:84%
I'd never had an
experience like this.

00:07:12.556 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I blurted out, don't let
anything inside the gate,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
you know, the fenced area.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.326 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, like
you would have a choice.

00:07:21.326 --> 00:07:21.875 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:22.999 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Don't let them in!

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's absurd
when you think about it.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.431 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Yeah, it
was kind of absurd.

00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I actually thought we
were under some kind

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:90%
of a terrorist attack.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I actually thought someone was
trying to enter the facility

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.790 align:middle line:90%
and take it over.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:90%
I really did.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.044 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.044 --> 00:07:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So after I told
him that, he said,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:90%
sir, my guard just got injured.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have to go.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:90%
He hung up the phone.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I went over to talk to my
commander who was taking a rest

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:84%
break on a little cot
we had down there.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.985 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I was about to tell him
about the phone calls

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
when we get all these bells
and whistles going off.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And literally, we have
klaxons down there.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:90%
We have lights.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:90%
We have a display board.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.054 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.054 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
We all looked over
at the display board,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.375 align:middle line:84%
and sure enough, the missiles
were all going offline.

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.605 align:middle line:84%
So all ten of them went
what we call no-go.

00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:90%
They could not be launched.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's important to emphasize
this was not a power failure.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: We had power.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.150 align:middle line:90%
We had back-up power.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.620 align:middle line:90%
It was not a power failure.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're 60
feet under the ground,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.094 align:middle line:90%
inside steel and concrete.

00:08:34.094 --> 00:08:34.719 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Right.

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And these missiles were
independent of each other.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
They were not dependent
on the other missiles.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
whatever was up there,

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:84%
whatever object
was up there, had

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
to send a signal through 60
feet of earth and concrete

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and then penetrate
triply shielded cables.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
We had cabling systems going
to each of the missiles,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.195 align:middle line:84%
all shielded against EMI,
Electromagnetic Interference.

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So they'd have to penetrate
that, send a specific signal.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Because on each
missile we queried--

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and we had a system of
querying the missile--

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:84%
they showed guidance and
control system failure.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So it was the same failure
mode on each missile.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Robert,
this is not the only time

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:84%
this has happened either, and
in fact, a very similar thing

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:90%
had just happened.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.904 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that one.

00:09:34.904 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: That's right.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And on this, I need to tell you
that we had two things that we

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:90%
needed to do right away.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:84%
One was report to
the command post.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So my commander did that back at
Great Falls, the Malmstrom Air

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Force Base.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We were about 100
miles east of there.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.010 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is we had
two warning lights showing

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
that there was a possible
incursion at the launch

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:90%
In other words--

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: --we had proximity
locators, or motion detectors,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
at the launch facilities where
the missiles were located.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.306 align:middle line:90%
And those had been lit up.

00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Somehow breached.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.803 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Somehow breached.

00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So we had to send
guards out there.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, my commander
Fred finishes reporting this

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to the command post and
turns to me and says,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.381 align:middle line:84%
the same thing happened
at another flight.

00:10:33.381 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When say
another flight,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:90%
that means another area?

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Another launch control
center area, same set up,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:90%
10 missiles.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
called Echo, right?

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: And that was
called Echo Flight.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.761 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the time,
I thought he meant

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
the same thing had
happened that evening.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: But what
he should have said

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:84%
was the same thing
happened about a week ago.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
Echo Flight incident,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.610 align:middle line:84%
March 16, 1967, about
eight days earlier.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.942 align:middle line:84%
The Deputy Commander
was on alert status.

00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
He gets an indication of a
missile shutdown on his board.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
He calls out to the site
where we had maintenance crews

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and security guards,
had spent the night,

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and he thought that
they had gone ahead

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and started their work by
shutting the missile down.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.122 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to complain
about that because they're

00:11:38.122 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:84%
supposed to check with
him before they do that.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But they said, no, we
didn't do anything.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:84%
By the way, there are
UFOs above us right now.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.419 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.419 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:90%
So this would beg a question.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think anyone
watching this right now

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
would say, hm, March of
1967, what was going on

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:84%
that such a display
needed to be made?

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking you.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: That's a good question.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we were in the middle
of a Cold War with the Soviet

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Union, well, actually all
the communist nations, China.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.255 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we were
engaged in Vietnam.

00:12:14.255 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
It was a tense time, but
after doing the research,

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:90%
I found out an interesting fact.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What?

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: In 1967, we,
the United States,

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
had about 33,000 nuclear
weapons in our stockpile,

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and this is the highest
total we have ever had.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So we were building
up-- we built up

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
a stockpile of nuclear weapons,
33,000, and then after '67,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.689 align:middle line:90%
we started on the downtrend.

00:12:54.689 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hm.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:90%
So we were at the peak.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: We were at
the apex, at the peak

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:90%
of our nuclear stockpile.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.366 align:middle line:84%
And I think our visitors--
I think these were

00:13:05.366 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial visitors--

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.073 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:07.073 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.769 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: --knew that, and they
were getting very concerned.

00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, this had to have made it
all the way around to the top,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I would think, of the
military in the United States.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
These things would
not go unreported.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Once you made your reports, they
make theirs, they make theirs.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So if this was happening
in multiple locations,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:84%
then the guys at the
top knew about this.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Absolutely.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you
ever hear anything

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:84%
about what the concerns
or comments were

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:90%
within the military circles?

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.159 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Yes.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, two things--
one, we received--

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, in 1994, I was able
to come forward with this,

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
so we requested, under the
Freedom of Information Act,

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:90%
to retrieve documents.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
documents we retrieved

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.510 align:middle line:84%
was a telex that said-- it
was from SAC headquarters,

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Strategic Air Command
headquarters-- saying that we'd

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
had this incident
at Echo Flight.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
All 10 missiles shut down
for some unknown reason.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- the
wording was something

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:84%
like it was imperative that
we find out what caused this.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:10%
We know that SAC
headquarters, which

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:10%
was General Curtis LeMay at
the time, knew about this.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we have
also eyewitnesses

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
that were working
on the Echo Flight

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:84%
to bring them back
up on alert status.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.500 align:middle line:10%
So there were a lot of
top brass at Echo Flight.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:10%
And by the way,
one of the men who

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:10%
had worked on bringing the Echo
Flight back on alert-- and I

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:10%
have to explain that the UFOs
did not damage the missiles.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
All they did was send a signal
to the guidance and control

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:08.520 align:middle line:84%
package to upset their
targeting system, basically.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:84%
We have an inertial
guidance system,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and this guidance system
was very sensitive.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It had to be set up properly.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:84%
They actually shot the stars
and made sure of the location.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:90%
This was before GPS.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And they used a little
collimator light

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to set up the missile exactly
so that when it was launched,

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
the computer could compute its
track and then be on target.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So one of these men
went out to the site

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and had a guard upstairs,
and he went down

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.937 align:middle line:90%
with his little checklist.

00:15:47.937 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And he started his
procedure for the startup.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And halfway into that, the
guard shakes the ladder leading

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.344 align:middle line:90%
upstairs, and he points up.

00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:90%
The guard's scared to death.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
He points up, and there's this
glowing, red ball of light.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
He described it as an
orange-red ball of light

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:90%
that was just above him.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And this man--
we'll call him Tex,

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.086 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better reason.

00:16:21.086 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Because he still wants to remain
anonymous for good reason.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.770 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:32.172 align:middle line:84%
So he sees this ball of light
and decides to report it.

00:16:32.172 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:84%
He tells the guard to
report it, but I've

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.511 align:middle line:84%
got to go back and get
this missile back up.

00:16:36.511 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
We've got a ball of
orange light there.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So he goes back down, and
he starts on his procedure.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:84%
He gets to a particular
point in his checklist,

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and the missile shuts
down again for no reason.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.957 align:middle line:84%
He goes through it
again and again.

00:16:54.957 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And again.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:84%
They shut it down
at the same point.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Each time, at the same
point, the missile shut down.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So he concluded
that this object,

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was-- and he could
feel the static electricity

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
coming down the
tube-- he concluded

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:84%
that this thing, the
intelligence behind this thing,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:84%
knew exactly how
our systems worked.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we go
into the next part, which

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
is really critical,
how did you feel

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.890 align:middle line:84%
on more of an emotional
psycho-spiritual level

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:90%
about what had happened?

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I know your views have changed
over the years considerably.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:90%
At the time, how did you feel?

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Was it a threat?

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Did you see it as a threat?

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: You know, I didn't
really see it as a threat.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.680 align:middle line:90%
I was very intrigued by it.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we
were muzzled right away.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.469 align:middle line:84%
The next day, we were ordered
never to talk about this.

00:17:46.469 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where we're
getting into the next part.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.406 align:middle line:84%
We could just say on a clipboard
here, the great cover-up.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Because people say all the time,
I mean people in my family,

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
well, if there were UFOs and
this stuff happened, then

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:90%
we'd be hearing about it.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The military--
we'd hear about it.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.149 align:middle line:90%
No, we wouldn't hear about it.

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:04.523 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to explain to us

00:18:04.523 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
just how-- the
anatomy of a cover-up.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: OK.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:90%
The anatomy of a cover-up.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the document
that they, basically,

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
forced me to sign stated that
I would be sent to prison

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years,
fined and imprisoned,

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:84%
if I ever told anybody
anything about this.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:84%
That was number one, and
that's pretty strong.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
pretty intimidating.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.209 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: That's
pretty intimidating.

00:18:33.209 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
they did-- and they

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:84%
have done this frequently--
is any of the witnesses,

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:84%
like those guards
upstairs, they never

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:90%
returned to the same facility.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:84%
They dispersed them, not just
within Malmstrom Air Force

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.602 align:middle line:84%
Base, but they sent
them to different bases.

00:18:50.602 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
couldn't talk about it,

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.150 align:middle line:90%
couldn't reinforce it.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.858 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Exactly.

00:18:53.858 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.170 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't spread rumors,
and they kept track of them.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:90%
They knew who they were.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a core
group of, I think, mainly

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
intelligence people in
the Air Force, the Navy,

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:84%
you name it, in government that
is controlling this secret.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, this cover-up
in particular, however,

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and which I wasn't aware
of at the time-- in 1966,

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.380 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force contracted with
the University of Colorado

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and specifically
appointed Edward Condon

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:84%
as the head of an
investigatory group.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
became the infamous--

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and I use the word
purposefully-- Condon Report.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.133 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: That's right, the
infamous Condon investigation.

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:49.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.992 align:middle line:10%
And this was an
Air Force contract.

00:19:51.992 --> 00:19:54.695 align:middle line:84%
I think it was at least
a half a million dollars.

00:19:54.695 --> 00:19:56.141 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.141 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of
money in the day.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: A lot of
money in the day.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And this was actually instigated
by a congressional hearing.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people don't
realize that in 1966 there

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:84%
was a congressional
hearing on UFOs,

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and it was ordered through
that that the Air Force go out

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and investigate
the UFO phenomenon.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, at any rate, this
was all a white wash.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.975 align:middle line:84%
It was, right from
the beginning--

00:20:24.975 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say the
chief scientist was a chemistry

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
teacher at the university
and knew nothing.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Well, the
chief investigator

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:90%
was a chemistry teacher.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.725 align:middle line:90%
His name was Dr. Roy Craig.

00:20:33.725 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He knew nothing
about the phenomena.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: He knew nothing
about the phenomena

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.345 align:middle line:90%
or how to investigate anything.

00:20:40.345 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to that,
Condon, at the request

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
of Robert Lowe, who
was his deputy, who

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:84%
kept saying to
Condon, you know, this

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
is really more of a
psychological problem.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And what you really
ought to have

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.544 align:middle line:84%
is psychiatrists on your
team because anybody

00:21:05.544 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
that would report these things
has got to be a little off.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No bias there, huh?

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: No.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So right from the
beginning, it was a problem.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:84%
But the investigation
started in August of 1966.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.080 align:middle line:84%
They were just getting
organized by the start of '67,

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and then our incidents
happened in March of '67.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.030 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force did not want
the Condon committee involved

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:84%
at all, even though
this Dr. Craig had

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:42.135 align:middle line:84%
heard about the shutdowns
and UFOs from a man

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Ray Fowler, who
happened to work for Sylvania,

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
which was-- as an electrical
contractor for the Minuteman.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And he had contractors
in the field

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
at Malmstrom who had told
him that, yeah, there

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:84%
were shutdowns of
missiles, and by the way,

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.800 align:middle line:90%
UFOs were responsible.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.375 align:middle line:84%
And he had names, dates,
et cetera, of people

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:07.466 align:middle line:90%
that he should interview.

00:22:07.466 --> 00:22:08.931 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
spoke truthfully.

00:22:08.931 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.591 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.591 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Ray Fowler was great,
and he put his job on the line

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:90%
to tell this story.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So he told Craig, the chief
investigator for the Condon

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:84%
committee, about these things
and gave him names, dates.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Craig shows up in October of
'67, talks to the deputy base

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:84%
commander-- I'm
sorry, base operations

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:84%
officer, a man by the name of
Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Chase.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:90%
He wants to investigate this.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And Chase is
shocked that he even

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.670 align:middle line:84%
knew about it because there was
a secret investigation going

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:90%
on the Air Force was conducting.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So there was not only a civilian
investigation by Boeing,

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:84%
but there was an internal Air
Force investigation also going

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.960 align:middle line:84%
on, which was a
classified thing.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: And that's exactly
what Chase told Craig.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.965 align:middle line:90%
He said, this is classified.

00:23:07.965 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.354 align:middle line:84%
You are not to know
anything about this.

00:23:12.354 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
And here we've got--

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's supposed
to be investigating it.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: He's supposed
to be investigating it.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, OK, the whole
thing was a whitewash.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:90%
It was a sham.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:90%
The Condon Report was a joke.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:20.646 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Yes.

00:23:20.646 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
everybody now--

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:84%
it's gone down in
history as a joke.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Right.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No serious
effort was ever

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:90%
made to study the phenomena.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:84%
To this day, it's
still not being made,

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.084 align:middle line:84%
and here we are 50 years
later, practically.

00:23:33.084 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: That's right.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, OK, we've
got a few minutes left.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:84%
You've had a lot of
experience since then.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
You've had a lot of time
to think about this.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:84%
You went rogue after
a period of time,

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and you broke that
security oath.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Was that something
that you just thought--

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:84%
you woke up one day
and said, hey, I

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:90%
can't hold this in anymore?

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:51.400 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I know a lot
of the men really

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.745 align:middle line:84%
suffered psychologically over
whether to break this security

00:23:56.745 --> 00:23:57.719 align:middle line:90%
oath.

00:23:57.719 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: I didn't think I was
breaking an oath, to be honest.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
The way I came forward was I
picked up a book in a library

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.400 align:middle line:84%
in 1994 called
"Above Top Secret."

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:90%
I happened to turn to page 301.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, I've
interviewed Timothy Good.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: And on
page 301, it says

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.435 align:middle line:84%
missiles were shut down during
a UFO encounter at Malmstrom Air

00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:20.074 align:middle line:90%
Force base in 1967.

00:24:20.074 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There it is.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:90%
It's already out there.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: There it is.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:90%
It's out there.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:90%
I can talk about it now.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I thought.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.835 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that really
gave you permission.

00:24:27.835 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Well, I
was not sure yet.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.105 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of
couched my approach--

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I approached MUFON,
Mutual UFO Network,

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:84%
investigator James Klotz
in Seattle and said,

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:84%
look, I'd like you
to submit an FOI

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
request about this
Echo shut down,

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:84%
but don't say
anything about UFOs

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and don't mention
my name please.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Just do it on your own.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Lo and behold, we receive
a reply from the Air Force.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:07.860 align:middle line:84%
They say this incident
is still classified.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.640 align:middle line:84%
However, since
it's been so long,

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
declassify it, and we'll

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.817 align:middle line:84%
send you some documents
related to it.

00:25:16.817 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there you go.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: So there go.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Some documents
started coming in.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I thought
I was at Echo Flight.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, I was
not at Echo Flight.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
But they started sending
documents, so I went public.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I actually went on
"Sightings" program.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.646 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
remember that one.

00:25:36.646 --> 00:25:38.459 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I
don't, but anyway--

00:25:38.459 --> 00:25:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: It's before your time.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:41.210 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I met you a few years
later at Disclosure,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
which was probably
some six years later.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.925 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Right.

00:25:45.925 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So I started speaking
on the radio, et cetera.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.135 align:middle line:84%
I start calling people,
talking about this.

00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:90%
So I basically had gone public.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Were you ever visited?

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Were you ever told to be
quiet, or did they just

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.078 align:middle line:84%
leave you alone
from that point on?

00:26:00.078 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: Well,
that's a long story,

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:84%
but yeah, I'll just say there
were times when I felt coerced.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I would
think you would be.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: It wasn't
until 1996 that I

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
realized I was not
at Echo Flight.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I was at Oscar Flight
and on a different night.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Separate event.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Seperate event.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the
one they'd been

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:84%
writing about in
"Above Top Secret."

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: No, so
technically, I am still

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:84%
in violation of my
oath, but at that point,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.100 align:middle line:90%
I decided to keep going.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I had gone public,
and I said, you know,

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I really would like
to get this out.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happened in
those intervening years?

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.890 align:middle line:90%
You've experienced a lot.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
James Gilliland was telling me
you've been up to the ranch.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And you've kind of experienced
phenomena yourself now.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And just as a kind of
wrap, from the time when

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
you were so young to now,
almost 50 years ago to today,

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:84%
what has come to be your
viewpoint on what the UFO's

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:84%
participation is, what
they were trying to do,

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and what you feel
they're trying to do now?

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.880 align:middle line:10%
>>SALAS: Yeah, I came
to the early conclusion,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:10%
after going public,
after a year or two,

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:10%
that I was convinced--
what they did, in my case,

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:10%
was just send a
message, and the message

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:10%
was get rid of your
nuclear weapons.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:25.946 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:25.946 --> 00:27:27.849 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.849 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: They're really
not weapons of war.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I hope you understand
they're not weapons of war.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.625 align:middle line:84%
They're weapons of
mass destruction.

00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: You don't use these in
wartime as a tactical weapon.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.594 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
about annihilation.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: It's about
annihilation of masses--

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:90%
huge masses of humanity.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:48.777 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:48.777 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:10%
>>SALAS: I came to that
conclusion early on.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, as far as
the phenomenon itself,

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.160 align:middle line:84%
the UFO phenomenon--
by the way, I've

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
become committed--
up to this point,

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm still very committed to the
abolition of nuclear weapons

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
reasons I do interviews,

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I speak out at
conferences, and I'm

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.180 align:middle line:84%
going to continue to do
that as long as I can.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.790 align:middle line:10%
But as far as the phenomenon
itself, of course, I

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.755 align:middle line:10%
had other experiences,
and I'd met other people.

00:28:18.755 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I've
got a new book out,

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:84%
which will be out in September
called "Unidentified: The UFO

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Phenomenon," by New Page Books.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:90%


00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:90%
I have evolved.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have
evolved in my opinion

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.210 align:middle line:90%
of different kinds of stories.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.060 align:middle line:84%
At first-- I'm a
real left-brainer,

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and I just dismissed
most of what

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I heard from other people, these
crazy stories of abductions

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.500 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But I've certainly
evolved to where

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.626 align:middle line:84%
I'm much more accepting
of a lot of things.

00:28:58.626 --> 00:29:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that
note, thank you

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
so much for speaking
with us about it.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
your time, Robert.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Thank you.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
