00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: There's
perhaps no more mysterious

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:10%
and highly regarded tale of
man's valor than the story

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.350 align:middle line:10%
of King Arthur and his knights.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the mystery as to
who he was and where he lived

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:10%
is a little closer
to being solved.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Caitlin Matthews
and her husband,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
John, have spent decades
researching and hunting

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:90%
down King Arthur.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.890 align:middle line:84%
What they have found
may be surprising to us.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a little
different rendition

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.154 align:middle line:84%
of the story than a
lot of people who've

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
been watching the movies
and reading the books

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and the fairy tales have
become accustomed to.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless potent,
very potent, so welcome.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.374 align:middle line:84%
>>CAITLIN MATTHEWS:
Absolutely, thank you.

00:00:57.374 --> 00:00:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's funny.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
We were all in the green
room a few moments ago

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
getting our makeup
touched up when

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
the royal wedding
between Harry and Meghan

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:84%
is taking place, just
as they were walking up

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
the aisle about to take
their nuptials and all that.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
the royal family itself is still

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
living off a lot of those
principles that were laid down

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:90%
in the 12th and 13th century.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to that
in the conversation

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
as to how that influenced
even modern day Britain.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
But first of all
you and your husband

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:90%
are award winning journalists.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:90%
You've written many, many books.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad to be with
you because I've

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.494 align:middle line:84%
tried to get to you
a couple times when

00:01:32.494 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:90%
I've been in England.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And this particular one, what
fascinated you to the extent

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400 align:middle line:84%
that you spent all
this time hunting down

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.562 align:middle line:84%
what you have come to
find as close to the truth

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:90%
as you can get at this point?

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:10%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, I don't
think I'm looking for historical

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:10%
truth and neither is John.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:10%
We've been really working
with the myth of King Arthur.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:90%
And of course that's really--

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.111 align:middle line:84%
you know, myth for us
is our prime mainstream

00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
that, as Celestius,
who was the--

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
a man who answers to
the Emperor Julian

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
said, "A myth is something
that's never happened

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:90%
and is happening all the time."

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
that's very well put.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:84%
It's this mythological notion of
valor, of courage, of chivalry

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.986 align:middle line:84%
and so forth has certainly
withstood the test of time.

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously there's
something within our own innate

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:84%
beings that's craving
something of that, right?

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:10%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, I think
the Arthurian legends,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:10%
in "The Complete King Arthur"
that John and I wrote,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:10%
we're really looking at how
Arthur has been perceived

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:10%
through time.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:10%
Because every single
era has its own myth.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:90%
It has its own rendition.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:90%
It dresses it up.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:10%
It's the same if you look
at, say, films of Robin Hood.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
The films of Robin
Hood all come--

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:84%
the Errol Flynn one comes with
'30s makeup and hair styles.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So we know when it was, we
know the film was made then

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
because of the kind of makeup
and costume that it's in.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it sort of looks medieval.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But it also looks
'30s at the same time.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose that the
legend is the same.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.467 align:middle line:84%
And if, we know there
are lots of Robin Hood

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
films about to come
out at the moment.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:90%
And they'll all be of this era.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So that everyone will
have very grungy haircuts.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And they will be wearing leather
and various other things.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So they'll look like
goths on a bad day.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.409 align:middle line:90%
It'll be looking different.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
Arthurian legend looks

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
very different from
whichever perspective

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.820 align:middle line:90%
you look at through time.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Before we launch
into this incredible breadcrumb

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:10%
trails of dates and times and
locations because everyone has

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:10%
a different viewpoint.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.792 align:middle line:84%
And every author has a
different viewpoint on it.

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
you just mentioned,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
this whole notion of how the
Arthurian legend is perceived

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:90%
in a given era.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:90%
In the 21st century--

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
20th and 21st century for
sure it's through a lens,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
certainly in the United States
and I think Europe as well,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:90%
of extreme romanticism.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And so what is it about where
we are as a civilization

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
evolving that takes
us to embrace it

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.566 align:middle line:84%
on such an incredibly personal,
romantic, heartfelt level?

00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: I don't know.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:84%
I think the romantic
thing really

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:90%
came in in the 19th century.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're still with
it to some degree.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Guy Ritchie's latest
film was definitely

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:90%
a shoot 'em up, beat 'em up.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's have some kung
fu in here as well.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think, I wouldn't
say that's necessarily

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:90%
the Arthur of our time.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:84%
But of course, how Arthur starts
out is as a liberator at a time

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:90%
when there's invasion.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's the Dark Age Arthur.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose that we're
nearer in time to that

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
now in terms of the themes
that are going on in our world

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:90%
that people feel threatened.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Their boundaries are
shifting and changing.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Other people are trying to
come over those boundaries

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.582 align:middle line:90%
from other places.

00:05:02.582 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have
large movements of people,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:90%
you have a lot of paranoia.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of difficulty
about, well, this is our place.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.194 align:middle line:90%
And they shouldn't come here.

00:05:13.194 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's going on all over
the world at the moment,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:84%
isn't it, whichever
continent you look at.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when
people feel threatened,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.457 align:middle line:84%
they are under threat
on a personal level,

00:05:22.457 --> 00:05:24.790 align:middle line:84%
it brings out a different
characteristic, you're saying.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.956 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: It does indeed.

00:05:25.956 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we are nearer
in mythic terms to the dark ages

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:84%
now than we are to
the romantic era.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I think the romantic era
of Arthur, I would predict,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.486 align:middle line:84%
is now passing
away a little bit.

00:05:39.486 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting,
there will be a lot of ladies

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:90%
watching this, sad to hear this.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.007 align:middle line:84%
But we can hold it in our
hearts however we wish, right?

00:05:46.007 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Indeed.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
were your resources?

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.990 align:middle line:84%
You took a couple of decades,
sifting through all of this,

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.577 align:middle line:84%
to piece together a possible
origin of this myth, right?

00:05:57.577 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, John's been
really working at this since he

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:90%
was 15.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:90%
And he's 70 now.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my gosh, OK.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: He's been at
that for a very long time.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.480 align:middle line:84%
My interest has always been
in the earlier legends.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:90%
So John does the medieval.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And I do the
slightly earlier end.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So together we make
a nice parabola.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and so this
spans roughly 1,800 years

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:90%
of history.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking
at a history that

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
leaves kind of like
Jesus and people

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
are trying to hunt
down the evidence

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
for his physical existence,
the very few physical clues.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.533 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: We
have textual clues.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have
archaeological clues so

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
that the time when invasions
of Anglos and Saxons

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:84%
started to come into Britain
in the fifth century,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:84%
we suddenly see the
Roman fortifications

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and the Iron Age hill forts
are suddenly refortified.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.290 align:middle line:10%
So someone was organizing that.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:10%
Someone was saying, these
are the assets we have.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's dig in here and
keep up a good resistance.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and let's
talk about society of the day.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
happened when the Romans came.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about how it
affected Britain and the people

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and what the resistance was
like throughout Britain.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, when the
Romans left was the problem.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
The Romans had been
here from, well,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:90%
they started coming in 55 BC.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But they made a
real good comeback

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the first century.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.471 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd been here
organizing and administrating

00:07:40.471 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and all those sorts of things.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.678 align:middle line:84%
So it was like suddenly
all that infrastructure

00:07:43.678 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
left at the beginning
of the fifth century.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they did a
wonderful job of laying down

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:90%
infrastructure.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.703 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: They certainly did.

00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Aqueducts and
roads and a lot of technology.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Yeah, so yes,
so suddenly none of that was

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.626 align:middle line:84%
And obviously some
of it must have

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
continued, as it does in times
of war all over the place.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
The people who were
position holders

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.355 align:middle line:84%
would have continued
in those positions.

00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But then it would be,
well, who's leading us?

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So that the tribal leaderships
began to come up again.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was those
tribal leaderships

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:84%
that were really beginning
to make the difference

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:84%
against the sudden, vast
incursions of people

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
who are coming here because
they wanted a new land.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:84%
They wanted farm
land they could farm.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.188 align:middle line:84%
But of course they had to fight
those that were here first.

00:08:27.188 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So we think that Arthur was one
of those that stepped forward.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.200 align:middle line:84%
As one Arthurian
scholar said once,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:84%
if you took all the mentions
of Arthur out of the record,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.567 align:middle line:84%
there would be an
Arthur-shaped hole.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's the Arthur-shaped hole.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's a bit like the
excavations at Sutton Hoo that

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:90%
found the Saxon kings.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.480 align:middle line:84%
The soil was not
good to hold bodies.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
It kept the artifacts like the
gold and the metals and so on.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:90%
But everything else rotted away.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So what were left of
the gold on the metals,

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that's all we have left
of this very early legend.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes important
in successive times

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.670 align:middle line:84%
throughout history
that Arthur is

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.860 align:middle line:84%
the great leader who
comes forward to do things

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:90%
at particular times.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So for the British people he
becomes the great liberator.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
But then of course we
get conquered severally.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
We have the Normans coming in,
the ancestors of the queen.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right,
OK, but the thing is,

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:90%
it is this throughout history.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Before we start drilling
down into places

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and potential
tracking of clues, it

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:84%
is this persistent rendering
of a heroic figure that pops up

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:84%
at different, in
different centuries that

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
is captivating the heart
and the minds of the people.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And this, now this is a little
edgy place to go with it.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But it says in some
of the lineages

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and the hermetic in
particular believes

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
that the entity known as Horus,
the great one of the horizon

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that has this particularly
loving relationship

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:84%
with the planet Earth,
would incarnate occasionally

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.280 align:middle line:84%
or certainly whisper
his essence into many

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
of the great known
archetypal figures of wisdom,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.324 align:middle line:90%
teachers of the ages.

00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Like
Vishnu in India.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:31.948 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, like Vishnu--

00:10:31.948 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
would breathe itself
into these characters.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And the same characteristics,
the same history,

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
the same lore, the same
legend would pop up

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
in the lives of all of
these, these same people,

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
the same birthday,
the same virgin birth,

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:84%
in the story of Jesus,
for example, that perhaps

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
as one entity kept touching
in with and inspiring,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.740 align:middle line:84%
reincarnating
humanly throughout.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the Arthur figure

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:84%
might be a similar
kind of valiant warrior

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:90%
throughout history?

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: The Welsh
legends talk about that.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a very early
Welsh poem called

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:90%
"The Stanzas of the Graves."

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And it talks about
the graves of heroes.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.144 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets to Arthur.

00:11:13.144 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And it says, not wise the
thought a grave for Arthur.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So we can't even think about
that because of course he's

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.972 align:middle line:90%
not dead and buried.

00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, I get chills.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: In the story he
goes to Avalon to be healed

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
of his wounds, which of course
is a later spin on the story,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.956 align:middle line:84%
but a medieval
spin on the story.

00:11:31.956 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it means he
continues and continues.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: But
he can come back.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that the
Normans did was of course,

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:84%
we said, we found his body
at Glastonbury Abbey, which

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:84%
of course puts page
to all of that.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's, when that happens
in the 12th century, that's

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
a, that's saying, two
fingers to you Welsh people.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.641 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Your liberator is never
going to come back

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:90%
because we found his body, yes?

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, but at the
same time if what we're talking

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:84%
about has truth in it and this
one lives again and again,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:84%
the once and future king, then
we may be talking about another

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle line:84%
one of these incredibly potent
entities that has the ability

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:84%
to appear when time is needed
among a group of people who

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.535 align:middle line:90%
need such a leader at that time.

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, I don't
think that we see incarnations

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:84%
of Arthur in quite the same
way that we see incarnations

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.860 align:middle line:90%
of Vishnu.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:84%
What we see is the
incarnation of the legend.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And the legend and
the myth are respun.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So the conquest of Wales
and Scotland by Edward

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.350 align:middle line:84%
the First, another ancestor of
the queen, was really about,

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
he really wanted to be
King Arthur himself.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to be him
politically and actually.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So of course he went
into those countries.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
He took away their
holy relics, which

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.800 align:middle line:90%
were associated with Arthur.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So the battle helm, the
taliath of the Welsh princes

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.577 align:middle line:84%
was something that he took
and put in his treasury,

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:90%
which was supposed--

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.701 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So that makes sense.

00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MATTHEWS: --to be an Arthurian
legend, an Arthurian artifact.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And in Scotland he
took away the Stone

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
of Stane, the Stone of Scuin
on which the kings were

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:90%
inaugurated.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So he was taking all those
artifacts to himself.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.612 align:middle line:84%
And of course his grandson
makes a round table at Windsor.

00:13:26.612 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I've seen
the round table at Windsor.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: But it goes, but
of course the actual round table

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.490 align:middle line:90%
ends up in sort of Winchester.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In
Winchester, exactly.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.657 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So we kind of see
the Norman kings themselves--

00:13:38.657 --> 00:13:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To the train station.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: They become
very invested in this.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's be the very best kings we
can in the way of King Arthur.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So they're purloining
the legend.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Through myth.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.266 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the
same time sometimes

00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:57.890 align:middle line:84%
there are great souls
who come through.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And they do inspire people
in that way in every age.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And this myth can be overlaid
and applied to that character.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll dive into the
breadcrumbs or the bits

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:90%
of evidence on the trail.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.026 align:middle line:84%
And the historical face,
the oldest historical face,

00:14:12.026 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
as you say in your
book, appeared

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
in the second century
among Roman soldiers

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:90%
occupying Britain.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.112 align:middle line:84%
In the name as Lucius
Artorius Castus.

00:14:20.112 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
this character.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MATTHEWS: He's the
first of the name Artorius

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that we can find in
terms of evidence.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And of course he was
a Roman commander.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And he commanded a
group of Sarmatians.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.440 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
the Romans did was

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that whenever they
went into a province,

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
they didn't recruit people
to the army in that country.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.892 align:middle line:84%
But they recruited
them into the army

00:14:46.892 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:90%
and sent them somewhere else.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So they could go and bother
some other country really.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the Sarmatians, who
in that meeting of Asia,--

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.340 align:middle line:84%
so sort of where
Chechnya is now--

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:90%
come to Britain.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:90%
And they're stationed here.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.065 align:middle line:84%
And they're stationed
along Hadrian's Wall.

00:15:06.065 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're also stationed
just above the area

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:90%
around Cheshire now.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And his name is the
very first that comes.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But where the myth comes in here
is that the Sarmatian people

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
had their own legends,
which of course become

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:23.850 align:middle line:90%
very familiar to us suddenly.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we hear
about a hero called

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Batraz, who has a sword which is
thrown into a lake, and so on.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have all kind of
quite interesting legends

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:84%
which suddenly come into
this country via that way.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of John's theories is
that the Lucius Artorius legend

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
could well be a precursor
for what we understand

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.835 align:middle line:90%
as the Dark Age Arthur.

00:15:49.835 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:10%
And we know what Lucius
Artorius' achievements

00:15:53.310 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:10%
were because a monument was
found in what's now Croatia.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And John was responsible,
among many others,

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.409 align:middle line:90%
to help its conservation.

00:16:05.409 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But it actually lists
all his achievements.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So we know a little
bit more about him.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So a heroic
figure of the day.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So he's a
commander of Sarmatian troops.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.739 align:middle line:90%
And there he is.

00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And we know very little more
about him in that respect.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Other
than he was there.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Yes, he was there.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.346 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then there's
another character that pops up

00:16:25.346 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth century.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Can you draw a line between
the second century character?

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So we don't
really in a direct way.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But as I say, we have
the Saxon incursion.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly we have people
coming in boatloads,

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
first of all, warriors, and
then when they've settled in,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
coming back with
their families--

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
so really meaning
to settle here.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course,
that displaces so much

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:90%
They settled here in London.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
They settled along the east
coast, of East Anglia, Norfolk,

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and right the way up the
east coast of Britain,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and gradually tried to
move into the areas which

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:90%
were occupied by Britons.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And so there was quite
a fierce resistance.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And in some places they
were very successful.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And the places where,
that held out the longest

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:84%
were the ones with the center
and the west of the island.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And it said in the
Welsh documents

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:90%
that Arthur fights 12 battles.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:90%
So we can identify some of them.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And others we can't
with great certainty.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:84%
But it looks as
though he's ranging

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:84%
a whole series of campaigns
across the country

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.920 align:middle line:84%
right the way up to what we
now think of as Scotland.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As Scotland, yes,
OK, and going back to Artorius,

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Castus, who were the
so-called lizard people?

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: The way that the
Sarmatians armored themselves

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.820 align:middle line:84%
with these overlapping leaps
of armors so they looked like

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.740 align:middle line:90%
lizard scales.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And so of course in armor
making, that's very good armor.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.187 align:middle line:90%
That's very defensive armor.

00:18:11.187 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And the people who have
that on their bodies

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and not easily penetrated by
arrows or swords or spears.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So they were also of course,
they rode on horseback.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:90%
So they were mounted cavalry.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:90%
So they were formidable foes.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how did
this start filtering

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:84%
into the Arthurian
dragon symbolism?

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well,
we wonder about this

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
because the Sarmatians
had a standard,

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:90%
which was like a wind sock.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:90%
But it was in dragon form.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the dragon becomes
embedded in British history

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:90%
in two different ways.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It becomes on one
side the emblem

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.580 align:middle line:84%
of Wales, which is the
remnant of Britain.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:84%
The Welsh people are
the original Britons.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And they have that
is their emblem.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And it also comes into
the royal house of Wessex.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere along the
line, someone from Britain

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
married some Saxons, who were
getting quite successful.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes,
the area of Wessex

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
is what we would largely regard
as the south of England now.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And that was also
their emblem as well.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So we think this quite possibly
a transmission from the wind

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.820 align:middle line:90%
sock banner through to the--

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From the Welsh,
you had the scale like armor.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:90%
And you had the wind sock.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And you start getting this
little portrait of dragons

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of
reptile presence.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: The sense of the
energies of the land is also

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:90%
being dragon like.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that does come
down in myth very well

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:84%
in the story of Merlin, who
is of course, in British,

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:90%
he's Myrddin Emrys.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And he is the one that,
when King Vortigen, who

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:84%
is one of those kings who
arises in the wake of the Romans

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:84%
leaving and the Saxons coming
in, tries to build a tower.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And his tower
keeps falling down.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And he asks druids,
so what we do

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:90%
to stop the tower falling down?

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.598 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
obviously something

00:20:16.598 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:90%
magical going on here.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And his druids
say, well, you must

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.812 align:middle line:90%
find a boy that has no father.

00:20:21.812 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:90%
And so of course they go out.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.250 align:middle line:90%
They scour the land.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And they come across a little
group of boys playing ball.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the game, some
of the boys turn on one of them

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.847 align:middle line:84%
and say, you've
not got a father.

00:20:33.847 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:90%
And they think, oh, great.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
look any further.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Here he is.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.036 align:middle line:90%
And of course it's Myrddin.

00:20:39.036 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:10%
And Myrddin is dragged
back to the town

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:10%
to be sacrificed by the druids.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:10%
Because they thought, well,
if we lay a nice foundation

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.250 align:middle line:10%
sacrifice, of course
the tower will stand up.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But Myrddin steps forward
and says, excuse me.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Your tower keeps falling down.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Do you know why?

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course the druids have
not said what is causing it.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.940 align:middle line:84%
He says, I know
what is causing it.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
It is the two dragons underneath
the ground who are causing that

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:90%
by their eternal fighting.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: His life was saved.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: It's like Jesus
in the temple with the doctors.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
He's a bit wiser
than the wise man.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, then
the dragons come forth.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And Myrddin becomes the
prophet of the Pendragons

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.727 align:middle line:90%
of the line of Arthur.

00:21:25.727 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We'll go to
that in a moment too.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Which part of the,
which years are we

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:84%
speaking about when this part
of the story comes to the fore?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, this legend
comes up both in the work

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:90%
of Nennius--

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:84%
so it is an eighth
century curricular

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and of course, it's
spun, yet again,

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.890 align:middle line:84%
by Geoffrey of
Monmouth, who's writing

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:90%
in the early 12th century.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So those legends are
boiling up all the time.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.732 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And people
love the story of Merlin.

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, yes.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's actually, if
you look at the record,

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:84%
he's probably much
more associated with--

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:84%
there may be two Myrddins,
of course, as well.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:84%
There's Myrddin Emrys, who is
associated with that dragon

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
Myrddin Wyllt, who's

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:84%
really to do with the northern
kingdoms of Britain, who

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
runs mad after the Battle
of Arfderydd in 587.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So we know, we have the poems
from that particular Myrddin.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, there's no
recorded physical evidence

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.520 align:middle line:84%
of Arthur in the fifth
and sixth century.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:84%
That's where it seems to
be set a lot of the time.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, I think
that particular period is

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:90%
the unknown period.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.505 align:middle line:84%
We have documentation
of the Romans obviously.

00:22:40.505 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And the people here in
Britain were Christians

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.426 align:middle line:90%
before the Saxon incursion.

00:22:47.426 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle line:90%
So there were clerics here.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And they were writing.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But of course they were
not writing anything

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
about people they
didn't approve of.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:10%
And we get the
feeling that, from one

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.800 align:middle line:10%
of those clerics,
Gildas, who leaves

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:10%
us a testimony of the
terrible things that

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:10%
are going on in Britain
at the time of the Saxons.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
He very carefully does
not mention Arthur.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
He mentions someone
called on Ambrosius.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Yes, which of course
is another name,

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Emrys and Ambrosius
are the same name.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So we wonder very much
what boils up from there.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of innuendo and--

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hint.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: --suggestion.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
little suggestion.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.744 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So it's like trying
to reconstruct present history

00:23:24.744 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
from a future time by a few
emails, a couple of letters,

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and someone's half
burnt document.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.070 align:middle line:90%
It's quite hard.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:39.074 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, absolutely, thus
it's taken 55 years of hunting

00:23:39.074 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:90%
on the part of your husband.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: It's a long time.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Absolutely, and
now let's bring in the symbol

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:10%
of the rose, which was very
important in Roman history

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:10%
and Christian history as well,
but also the notion of chivalry

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:10%
and how this came
into the story.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, the
chivalric entry of things

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:84%
into the equation really
comes in the medieval period.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's beginning to,
it comes, to some extent

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:84%
the Arthurian legends are
like the oldest running soap

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the way one
script writer dies.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Another one comes along.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.390 align:middle line:90%
And the story is continued.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And so of course, we
get the biggest upsurge

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:84%
of things in the, really
in the 12th century when

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.762 align:middle line:90%
people are really interested.

00:24:27.762 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I suppose there's that
sort of thing that

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:33.100 align:middle line:84%
happens that when a people
have been knocked back

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.540 align:middle line:90%
and are no longer--

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us what was
happening in the 12th century.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.625 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: In the 12th
century we have the Norman king.

00:24:38.625 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:90%
So we have the--

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:84%
1066, we have William
the Conqueror comes over.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And he puts down
the Saxon kings.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So we have a completely
different form of rulership,

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:90%
which is much more aggressive.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the Normans were
Vikings originally of course.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:90%
So they come in.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And they really impose
their hand upon the land.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.125 align:middle line:90%
So other things are happening.

00:25:05.125 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
The language of the
administration is French.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not English.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So there are a whole lot of
different things going on.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And France and England
are much more close.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So the, sometimes the kings
of England lived here.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they lived in France.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:84%
For them it was the same because
it was all their kingdoms.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:84%
But the storytellers
of that time

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.880 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to look back
at the culture that was here,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.420 align:middle line:90%
by which time it's become cute.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Cute?

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.678 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: You
know what happens?

00:25:36.678 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that
people look back at,

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:84%
people in the 20th century
look back to the 19th century

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.330 align:middle line:90%
and say--

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: How charming.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Wow, these Native
Americans look really cute.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you know, there's that
horrible thing that goes on.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:84%
A people has been colonized
and horribly put down.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
we have a very--

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:84%
but of course we can look back
at those stories and think,

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:90%
well, they were so wonderful.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So a similar thing
begins to happen there.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But then of course
they re-spin it

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
again so that now all
of Arthur's warriors

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:90%
become knights.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And Arthur, rather than
being a battle leader,

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.430 align:middle line:84%
a dux bellorum, in
the Roman fashion,

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:90%
has become a medieval King.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.662 align:middle line:84%
So there's this whole
different thing going on.

00:26:18.662 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because
they're charmed by it.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: They
are charmed by it.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're looking back
on it as an enchanted period.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: It is.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's already mythic to them,
which is very interesting.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.386 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be mythic in
the clothing of the time.

00:26:30.386 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us again what
was not charming about that

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.020 align:middle line:90%
era.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, when William
the Conqueror landed and did

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.060 align:middle line:84%
his conquest, he put down
what virtually is the whole

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:90%
of Yorkshire.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So there was just a
massacre and most people.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was called the
Harrowing of the North.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
his life, he actually

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.560 align:middle line:84%
built Battle Abbey in
penance for the number

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.450 align:middle line:84%
of people that were
not just killed

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:84%
at battle around Hastings
but also the people who

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:90%
were killed in the north.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So the Doomsday Book was
made, which literally

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.930 align:middle line:84%
meant that
administrators went round

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to every village, every town,
every farm and settlement

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and said, five cows, three
bondwomen, five pigs.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So everything, they knew
exactly what everyone had

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:90%
and how they could tax it.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So it was a taxation
machine, which

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:84%
was why it was called the
Doomsday Book because,

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.592 align:middle line:90%
and that would run forever.

00:27:32.592 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
still does, really.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: And still today the
people to whom William assigned

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.820 align:middle line:84%
the land and gave titles, about
the same number of people still

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:84%
own that land today
or their descendants.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, well, other
people who chronicled what was

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:84%
going on and kept track
of things were the monks.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately we
had literate monks

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
who were able to write down
the histories, the characters

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
of the day, and
what was going on.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So here, we come
to a figure named

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Arthur, a battle leader
against the Saxons,

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
who slayed 960
men single handed.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And this was written
down by a monk.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.605 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about his
rendering of an Arthur

00:28:14.605 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:84%
who was this great
leader in battle.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So we have a lot
of chronicles of the later time.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.720 align:middle line:90%
So we have Nennius.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:84%
We have Gildas, who does
not talk about Arthur very

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:90%
carefully.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But he's living nearer to the
first incursions of the Saxons.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Nennius is writing in the
eighth century, by which time

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.935 align:middle line:84%
the Welsh kingdoms
were still existent.

00:28:41.935 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:84%
But the Norman kingdoms were
about to be coming along

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:90%
quite soon.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So there was Saxons and
British living side by side.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Then you come into
the Norman era.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
We just have a whole lot
of other things going on.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have the, suddenly
there's a necessity

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:84%
for the churches, who've had
Saxon incumbents, to suddenly

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:84%
prove that they have a charter
to the land that they have.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things that they do

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:84%
is that they suddenly come
up with stories of Arthur.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:84%
King Arthur gave it
to our descendants,

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:90%
the forebears of our abbey.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And that abbot signed an
agreement with Arthur.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.626 align:middle line:90%
And here are some legends.

00:29:34.626 --> 00:29:37.125 align:middle line:84%
So there was quite a lot of
what I would call "back proving"

00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:90%
the evidence.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, to maintain--

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: In order
to maintain their title

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.060 align:middle line:84%
to the church or
abbey that they had.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it wasn't just
this pure documentation.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Oh,
no, so it was like,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.532 align:middle line:84%
but of course no one
can argue with the myth.

00:29:50.532 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Yes, And so if you
have a nice aged document that

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.580 align:middle line:84%
says King Arthur allowed the
former abbot to have this

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.380 align:middle line:90%
land--

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.879 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or in
the hand of a monk.

00:29:59.879 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Yes,
and it's the church.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:90%
So who can--

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Who can
argue against that?

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.233 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Indeed.

00:30:05.233 --> 00:30:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Exactly, OK, there's
another 10th century text that

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:84%
talks about his
conquest at Badon.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you say Bad-on?

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Bay-den.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Bay-den.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: The
battle of Badon.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.853 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And his death in 537.

00:30:15.853 --> 00:30:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But this comes along with the
death of Mordred, who's also

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:90%
been memorialized in the story.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
who Mordred was.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: There
were two versions.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.220 align:middle line:10%
The earlier version
of Mordred, who

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.890 align:middle line:10%
in British is called Medraut.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:10%
So Medraut is no
apparent relation

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:10%
of Arthur in that earlier story.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:84%
He's just someone who's
adversarial against him.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.690 align:middle line:84%
In order to, the
consistent story

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that runs between the
early one and the Mordred

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
that we know from the later
Arthurian legends, where

00:30:55.250 --> 00:31:00.717 align:middle line:84%
he's become the nephew
of Arthur, is Guinevere.

00:31:00.717 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Say this again.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So Guinevere
is the glue between the two

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:90%
characters.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So in some of the
earlier legends,

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Medraut comes into court.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.576 align:middle line:90%
And he takes his cup of wine.

00:31:11.576 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And he pours it down
the queen's front.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:90%
So he deeply insults her.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the earliest
play for Guinevere that we have.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
If we go to the
French writer, Wace,

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.930 align:middle line:84%
who's talking later
on about Mordred,

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:84%
while Arthur is
out of the country

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.040 align:middle line:84%
prosecuting wars abroad,
Mordred comes along

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:90%
and seizes Guinevere.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And he takes her to the Tower of
London just up the river here.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And there he keeps her
prisoner, because he's

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.739 align:middle line:90%
intending to marry her himself.

00:31:43.739 --> 00:31:44.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:90%
So it was, I think--

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.731 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Obviously
not consensually.

00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, we never
hear about what Guinevere thinks

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:90%
about anything.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But of course the earlier
the British Guinevere

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:84%
is Gwenevere, which
is her British name.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And she's very interesting
in her own right.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
She is very likely
the one through whom

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.690 align:middle line:84%
the sovereignty
of the land runs.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.090 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of legends
about the goddess of the land

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:90%
in Britain and Ireland.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.340 align:middle line:84%
They concern the
goddess of the land who

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.890 align:middle line:90%
allows someone to be the ruler.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:24.440 align:middle line:84%
She recognizes in him
the correct prescription

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:90%
for kingship or rulership.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:34.520 align:middle line:10%
And so every king rules with
her consent, as it were.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And even today in the marriage
right, in the coronation right,

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.209 align:middle line:84%
the monarch is formally given
the wedding ring of England.

00:32:45.209 --> 00:32:46.375 align:middle line:90%
So that's put on their hand.

00:32:46.375 --> 00:32:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's a still, it's a
similar sense of, if you're

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:84%
the ruler of the land,
you are also responsible

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:90%
to it as well as for it.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's still understood
in the coronation right.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So Guinevere may in
these early times

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.385 align:middle line:84%
have possessed that
sense of sovereignty,

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
that if you married her,
you married the land.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.197 align:middle line:84%
Whoever held Guinevere
holds the land.

00:33:13.197 --> 00:33:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Which makes her interesting
in a slightly different way.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very interesting,
now has she also appeared

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:22.760 align:middle line:84%
peripherally in your research
or directly as an archetypal

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:84%
figure that pops up
throughout British history?

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Yes, she is really,
the earliest mention that we

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.830 align:middle line:84%
have of her is in
"The Mabinogion"

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.280 align:middle line:84%
in the story of "Culhwch and
Olwen" where she appears.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.580 align:middle line:90%
She is mentioned as--

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: When is that?

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.865 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Arthur's wife.

00:33:36.865 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So the, we have a transcription
of "Culhwch and Olwen" from,

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:84%
it's about the
10th, 11th century.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's a writing
down of something

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.070 align:middle line:90%
that's a much earlier story.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:90%
We can tell from looking at it.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously come out of
the oral Bardic storytelling

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.920 align:middle line:84%
tradition because of the
way the language runs.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.950 align:middle line:84%
You can hear it's
a Bardic rendition.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And there she's just
mentioned as Arthur's wife.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's the very
first mention of her.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't really
come into the legends

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:90%
again until very much later.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:17.444 align:middle line:84%
So we hear more about her
in the medieval period.

00:34:17.444 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So going back
to the notion of the symbol

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.510 align:middle line:84%
of the rose and chivalry and
now that we have Guinevere

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:84%
introduced, where does the
character Lancelot begin

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:27.540 align:middle line:90%
appearing?

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Lancelot
comes in very late.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.662 align:middle line:90%
So he's not an early--

00:34:30.662 --> 00:34:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He's a
later construct--

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: He's a very
much later construct.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.617 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --that really
supports the chivalrous part

00:34:35.617 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:90%
of the story.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.429 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: He is.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.699 align:middle line:84%
He's the very perfect,
gentle knight.

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And he comes from France.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.969 align:middle line:84%
He has a whole series of
stories all about himself.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course one
of the ones we don't

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:52.280 align:middle line:84%
hear from the major
legends, but which

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.770 align:middle line:84%
comes in a wonderful story
which is called "Lancelot,"

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
is that when he
was a baby, there

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:84%
was a fire at the castle
where he was born.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And his mother and father
run out of the castle.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And his mother lays him on the
ground and goes, oh my God.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.970 align:middle line:90%
The castle's burning down.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:12.700 align:middle line:90%
And she's not looking.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.840 align:middle line:10%
But the Lady of the Lake
comes out of the lake

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.930 align:middle line:10%
and takes the baby and takes
it to be raised in Fairyland.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.210 align:middle line:10%
And he's, there he's taught
absolutely everything

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:25.096 align:middle line:10%
a young man should be
taught except chivalry.

00:35:25.096 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's a little
twist on our story.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So he learns all
the arts of fairy but none

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.702 align:middle line:90%
of the arts of war.

00:35:32.702 --> 00:35:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.785 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Yes, isn't it?

00:35:34.785 --> 00:35:37.500 align:middle line:84%
He can hunt and fish and
shoot and be kind to ladies,

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.574 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:35:38.574 --> 00:35:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course,
he's coming out

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:84%
of a very different box than
all these other worriers.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.367 align:middle line:84%
So you can understand how he
might be appealing in that way.

00:35:46.367 --> 00:35:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, and since
you brought her up,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.267 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the Lady
of the Lake for a moment.

00:35:51.267 --> 00:35:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Because in the modern day lore,
of course the Lady of the Lake

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.050 align:middle line:90%
has the knowledge.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The Excalibur is
thrown into the lake.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Yeah.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Lady of the
Lake, who comes, of course,

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:90%
into the medieval legends.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
She is really modeling the
queen of the other world.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And we would not think of
her as the queen of Faerie.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But she's the queen
of the other world.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And she has that wisdom.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.880 align:middle line:90%
The sword that--

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Arthur gets two swords.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:29.100 align:middle line:84%
He gets the sword that he
pulls from the stone, which

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:84%
is-- because of course
the stone allows the sword

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:90%
to be pulled from the stone.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.196 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going to
talk about that a little bit

00:36:36.196 --> 00:36:37.934 align:middle line:84%
in terms of where
that story came in.

00:36:37.934 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: But the second
sword that he has is the sword

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.060 align:middle line:90%
that comes from the lake.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And the sword that
comes from the lake

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:49.290 align:middle line:84%
is ritually given to him by the
Lady of the Lake in the legend.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course, so at the end of
his life, when he has his wound

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and he's not going
to get better,

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.970 align:middle line:84%
he asks for the sword to be
given back to her because it

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.290 align:middle line:90%
can't be passed on.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:02.295 align:middle line:90%
It's not his to give.

00:37:02.295 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
It has to go back to
the goddess of the land.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So we're back to that goddess
of sovereignty story yet again.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that
part's fascinating.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how did the
Knights of the Round Table

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.400 align:middle line:90%
come into the story?

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And what era are we
talking about then?

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: OK, so in
"Culhwch and Olwen,"

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.280 align:middle line:84%
the story I mentioned earlier,
which is an early British

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.080 align:middle line:90%
story--

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.100 align:middle line:84%
so I would imagine that that's
probably, in its essence,

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:31.140 align:middle line:84%
it's probably sixth century,
in terms of its content.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:36.510 align:middle line:84%
--nearly 300 warriors of
Arthur are named by name.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very long list.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.035 align:middle line:90%
And some we would recognize.

00:37:40.035 --> 00:37:43.645 align:middle line:84%
So there are people like
Kai, whom we know as Kay.

00:37:43.645 --> 00:37:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And there is Bedwyr,
whom we know as Bedivere,

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other British names
that people wouldn't recognize.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And it mentions the whole
of Arthur's household

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.700 align:middle line:90%
in this story.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.370 align:middle line:10%
These knights, some of them
come forward very strongly.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So Kay becomes Arthur's
foster brother in the story

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.350 align:middle line:90%
and a bit of a lout.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.840 align:middle line:10%
He's supposed to be the butler.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.500 align:middle line:10%
He's the one that's responsible
for the pouring of the wine.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But he's also the one that
sometimes doesn't welcome

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.660 align:middle line:90%
people to court very well.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:27.600 align:middle line:84%
We get Bedivere becoming much
more of a companion to Arthur,

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and then this whole
other chivalric, knights

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.550 align:middle line:84%
who come to be part
of the Round Table.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And where in this
lineage of myths and stories do

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Merlin and Arthur hook up?

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, so Merlin
has a whole separate set

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:48.600 align:middle line:90%
of stories.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And they become married to
the Arthurian legend sometime

00:38:53.760 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:84%
between the sixth century
and the later centuries.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And the first person
who picks up on him

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:09.730 align:middle line:10%
again is, Nennius mentions
the legends of Merlin

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.250 align:middle line:10%
in the eighth century.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And then Geoffrey
of Monmouth, who's

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:19.130 align:middle line:84%
really a British storyteller and
cleric, who picks up on that.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's the version
that the Norman court gets.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So those are wound together in
Geoffrey of Monmouth's "Vita

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Merlini," "The Life of Merlin."

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And you get him
reminiscing about things

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.750 align:middle line:90%
after he's run mad.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
When he's recovered
his wits again,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:84%
he speaks of his
time with Arthur

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and how he and the poet Taliesin
took Arthur over to Avalon

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.230 align:middle line:90%
in a boat.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, is there
evidence that this actually did

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.710 align:middle line:90%
occur?

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:56.085 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: I don't think
we're talking about historical

00:39:56.085 --> 00:39:56.890 align:middle line:90%
events.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
mythic events.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --marriage
of characters,

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.830 align:middle line:90%
of archetypal characters.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: They just, the
two stories just converge.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're joined really
firmly by Geoffrey of Monmouth,

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.020 align:middle line:84%
who also writes a history
of the kings of Britain.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And so he is Welsh.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So he can sew all these
things together pretty well.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.814 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, the bards,
the top bards of the planet.

00:40:21.814 --> 00:40:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: And he's
well-placed for everyone

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:24.230 align:middle line:90%
to hear them.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:25.896 align:middle line:84%
So of course everyone
gets to hear them.

00:40:25.896 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, of course,
OK, let's go into, do you say,

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Chretien de Troyes?

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Chretien, yeah.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Chretien de Troyes.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.494 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into his work, because
that's the first time the word

00:40:35.494 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:90%
"Camelot" starts appearing.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:42.729 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, it begins
to pile up around that time.

00:40:42.729 --> 00:40:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, the cast of
characters have already been

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.019 align:middle line:90%
introduced by this time.

00:40:46.019 --> 00:40:47.061 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: So we have--

00:40:47.061 --> 00:40:48.518 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
twelfth century.

00:40:48.518 --> 00:40:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS:
--Chretien introduces--

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:54.350 align:middle line:84%
in the 12th century, he
introduces quite a few things.

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:59.900 align:middle line:84%
He introduces the Grail
legend for the first time.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.540 align:middle line:84%
There are obviously lots
of different references

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.340 align:middle line:90%
that precede it.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:07.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's the first Grail
story, the story of the Grail.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And he also tells stories
of Arthur's nights, which

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.360 align:middle line:84%
are obviously known from
Welsh tradition, on which he

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.200 align:middle line:90%
has picked up on.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.586 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing that
we keep forgetting,

00:41:17.586 --> 00:41:19.460 align:middle line:84%
the thing that ties all
these things together

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and which we can't see because
it's happening backstage,

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is that the Normans
didn't speak English.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And the Normans did
not speak Welsh.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:31.430 align:middle line:10%
And so what they
really were using,

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:35.480 align:middle line:10%
in terms of speaking to
people, they used Latin most.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:84%
People who spoke Latin,
English, French, Norman

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.130 align:middle line:90%
French, and Welsh.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So these were the people
who were pinning everything

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.280 align:middle line:84%
together, holding the
administration together.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to be
able to talk to people

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.147 align:middle line:90%
that you've conquered.

00:41:52.147 --> 00:41:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely, you
have to tell them what to do.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: And also, but
stories are coming back from

00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:84%
the British and Welsh tradition
into the Norman courts via

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:01.460 align:middle line:90%
these people.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's interesting
because you say that the way

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.570 align:middle line:84%
the British perceived Arthur
versus the way the French

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
perceived Arthur are
two different things.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.944 align:middle line:90%
And tell us about that.

00:42:08.944 --> 00:42:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: They are.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So for the British, Arthur
is the great commander

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.590 align:middle line:84%
who's going to come again,
and he's going to throw off.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a poem called
"Armor's Prydein," which

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:23.480 align:middle line:84%
speaks of all
those who have been

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.590 align:middle line:84%
lost as a result of
the Saxon incursion.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And the poem ends
with "and a candle

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.740 align:middle line:90%
in the dark we'll go with them."

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
great hiraeth, which

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.840 align:middle line:84%
is what the Welsh call
this longing for something

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that you can't have,
which is lost and gone.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.955 align:middle line:90%
But you still have that longing.

00:42:39.955 --> 00:42:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think
everyone can relate.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.829 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: I think if you
look at any country around

00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:47.300 align:middle line:84%
the world, if there's
a, even the Balkan war.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:84%
You could see that the
oil boiled out exactly

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
as events that had

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.670 align:middle line:84%
happened on exactly the same
day in the 14th century.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:59.010 align:middle line:90%
So the memory is very long.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to
Wales, people will

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Instilled regard themselves
as the true people of Britain,

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.930 align:middle line:90%
which of course they are.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.013 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, they are.

00:43:07.013 --> 00:43:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And I did a little trek
and got lost along the way.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.740 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely
beautiful and wonderful

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.190 align:middle line:84%
looking for the castle
of Merlin in Wales.

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And what is that, the
remnants of those stones?

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Who actually occupied that?

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So Dinas Emrys,
which is in North Wales

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:84%
in Snowdonia, there are
some castellated remains,

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:32.980 align:middle line:90%
which are pretty ruinous now.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can climb
up and look at them.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:36.350 align:middle line:90%
But they are from a later era.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.700 align:middle line:90%
They're from the Norman era.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the Normans built
more castles in Wales

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:41.240 align:middle line:90%
than anywhere else.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.277 align:middle line:84%
And they built those castles
to subdue the people.

00:43:45.277 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what that's a remnant of.

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So Dinas Emrys is
the place that's

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.990 align:middle line:84%
mentioned as the
Tower of Vortigern.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.790 align:middle line:90%
That's that place.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:55.290 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: When I went there,
I didn't really understand any

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.480 align:middle line:10%
of the back story of it.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.870 align:middle line:10%
And I will say, anyone who
chooses to go there, waterfalls

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.850 align:middle line:10%
and green and ancient walls.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.160 align:middle line:10%
It's worth the trek.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.070 align:middle line:10%
It's so beautiful.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:10%
But the signage is horrible.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:10%
It goes like this.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.249 align:middle line:84%
I followed every sign perfectly
and ended up like this.

00:44:10.249 --> 00:44:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: That's fine.

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:13.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't find
Dinas Emrys as a result of that.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:84%
But of course Merlin's town
is Carmarthen, which is,

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.300 align:middle line:90%
that's actually what it means.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.060 align:middle line:90%
It means "Merlin's town."

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I wish I'd read this
and talked to you beforehand.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: And that's
in South Wales, of course.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I
couldn't recommend it more.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.090 align:middle line:90%
Wales is so beautiful.

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And that area of Wales
is absolutely gorgeous

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:37.190 align:middle line:90%
and enchanting in its own right.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:38.950 align:middle line:90%
The trees talk to you there.

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.470 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, we'll get off of that.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:45.410 align:middle line:10%
So in essence this story
of, the Arthurian legend,

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:48.800 align:middle line:10%
these parallels with
Jesus, the Prince of Peace,

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:53.270 align:middle line:10%
elevated to a regal status,
devoted acolytes, the death

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.400 align:middle line:10%
by betrayal of one's own.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.200 align:middle line:90%
These again--

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: And he's
born of a virgin.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Born of a virgin.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:59.324 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There you go.

00:44:59.324 --> 00:45:00.740 align:middle line:84%
These are really
parallel stories.

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: A strange
birth which is engineered.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's not clear whose
father he really has.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And these are the elements
of archetypal mythic pattern,

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:20.470 align:middle line:84%
which we recognize, that
nearly everyone has some,

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:22.370 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
notable mythically.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:27.200 align:middle line:84%
They have a very strange birth,
which is surrounded by mystery.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.200 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.140 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
kind of upbringing,

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.940 align:middle line:90%
all of these things.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So so many searches
have been launched as a result

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:41.800 align:middle line:84%
of the various parts of this
legend, particularly the grail.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And we have many British
authors, including the late Sir

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Laurence Gardner,
who has written

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.460 align:middle line:90%
about the search for the grail.

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So in your own research and
your husband's research as well,

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:53.330 align:middle line:90%
what is the grail?

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:55.170 align:middle line:90%
What does the grail represent?

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: The grail is a
halo of great virtue that brings

00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.500 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:04.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a physical object
that can be curated in a museum

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.050 align:middle line:84%
or like at the end of the
Indiana Jones first movie,

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:09.155 align:middle line:90%
stored in--

00:46:09.155 --> 00:46:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's not a chalice.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: No, no, it's
not something that can be

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.400 align:middle line:90%
discovered.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's one
of those myths that

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.720 align:middle line:84%
has a very distinct
pattern, that wherever

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:28.210 align:middle line:84%
you go in to look at it,
that it has this sense of,

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.760 align:middle line:84%
first of all, there was
a wonderful time of peace

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.240 align:middle line:90%
and plenty.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And then something
terrible happened.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And this something
terrible causes the land

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:41.290 align:middle line:84%
to lie waist and for the
fertility of the land

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:44.920 align:middle line:90%
to be completely overrun.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.270 align:middle line:90%
The waters withdraw.

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Everything is pretty bad.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And then within that
time, visions of the grail

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:54.650 align:middle line:90%
begin to appear.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So people say, why
are things like this?

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.670 align:middle line:90%
What can we do about it?

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:00.010 align:middle line:90%
They begin to ask questions.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think of all the
things in the grail legend,

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.362 align:middle line:84%
it's this question that's
the most important.

00:47:05.362 --> 00:47:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one that's very
relevant to our own time

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:08.370 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.750 align:middle line:84%
When we start to ask
questions about things,

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.100 align:middle line:84%
then of course things
begin to change.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:84%
We're able to begin to
assess where we stand

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and what we can do
about it and to draw

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:20.740 align:middle line:84%
upon the powers that
will actually help

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.150 align:middle line:90%
things to be restored again.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:24.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what happens.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Those that are called
upon to, by that vision,

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.330 align:middle line:90%
go out on quest.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to set right the
wrongs that have taken place.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And in
addition to all that,

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.230 align:middle line:84%
which is absolutely
beautiful, we have,

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I recently interviewed
Freddy Silva,

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.800 align:middle line:84%
another British author who
lives in America at this time.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Who, he takes the story
into the Knight Templar.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes
this, the Templar,

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the Knight Templar start
becoming implicated

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.630 align:middle line:90%
in the Arthurian story as well.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:00.550 align:middle line:84%
But he has done his
own exhaustive research

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:03.910 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their relationship
with the Cistercian monks

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:05.950 align:middle line:90%
and with France and Portugal.

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And what those monks had access
to by way of this incredible,

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.020 align:middle line:84%
you could say, druidic knowledge
of the nature of reality.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Because again we have to
remember that the druids were

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.060 align:middle line:90%
very highly esteemed.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.930 align:middle line:84%
The British Royalty
used the druids

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:24.410 align:middle line:84%
by their side to make decisions
of importance, for example,

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:27.970 align:middle line:84%
or to lay out the best
configuration of time

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:31.460 align:middle line:90%
when something should be done.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.550 align:middle line:90%
They were their advisors.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at it
through that perspective,

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.730 align:middle line:84%
they're saying that
the holy grail,

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:42.160 align:middle line:84%
or he's come to the position
that the holy grail is

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.490 align:middle line:84%
that knowledge that they
were trying to protect,

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:49.750 align:middle line:84%
which is the knowledge
of our own beings

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.780 align:middle line:84%
being able to traverse into
the highest aspect of ourselves

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and our understanding
and draw from that.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And it happens in stories of
Resurrection, for example.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
because it dovetails

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.830 align:middle line:84%
in with this deep, psychological
need for this healing

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and this merging
with this higher

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:13.180 align:middle line:84%
aspect of all, of
the larger mind

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and ourselves on our own
scale of consciousness.

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So we can begin the
healing process again.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Yeah, I think,
what caused us to go on quest is

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.520 align:middle line:90%
everyone's story.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.820 align:middle line:90%
We all have to go on a quest.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And what we find brings us to
different places within it.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we become,
as like the Knights,

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.170 align:middle line:84%
staging post for others
who are also on quest.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So our experiences can lead
and open doorways for that.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And some people really do
achieve extraordinary things

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:52.600 align:middle line:84%
for our world that we may not
give them cups and medals.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.500 align:middle line:84%
We may not know who
those people are.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:50:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like that, the legend, the
Jewish legend of the just man.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Someone said to me
once, so how many

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.680 align:middle line:84%
just men do you think
there are at the moment

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.790 align:middle line:90%
keeping the world?

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I said, enough that we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere out there
doing their own thing

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.166 align:middle line:84%
but not for themselves,
and I that's

00:50:17.166 --> 00:50:18.290 align:middle line:90%
the really important thing.

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:21.760 align:middle line:84%
That the quest that we're
talking about is not a,

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.260 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to make it all
the way to nirvana and back

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:26.500 align:middle line:90%
and bring back the award.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Is that these quests
are those that

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:34.500 align:middle line:84%
move into that hinterland
between our world and the other

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and begin to sew
them back together.

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Because that's,
it's the unsewing

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.050 align:middle line:84%
of the world that
is the problem--

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:45.340 align:middle line:84%
the two sides of reality
that needs to be as one.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And when they begin to pull
apart like any garment,

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.230 align:middle line:84%
we begin to feel very
uncertain about it.

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:53.040 align:middle line:84%
So the grail always
appears at that point.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we get things back
together again, it disappears.

00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It is withdrawn.

00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Beautifully put.

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:00.618 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: It is withdrawn.

00:51:00.618 --> 00:51:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And so it's, as I say, it's not,
it's the finger and the moon,

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:05.330 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:09.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not the grail that
we're in quest for.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the, what's
the grail brings.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.902 align:middle line:84%
And it's always this
vessel of healing.

00:51:12.902 --> 00:51:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely, and
that's just so beautifully

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:16.000 align:middle line:90%
stated.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to English knight, Sir
Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel.

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:24.610 align:middle line:84%
You say, one of the greatest
pieces of writing in English.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the subject
and why you consider it so.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So Sir Thomas
Malory spent considerable

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:34.810 align:middle line:90%
periods in prison.

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:36.670 align:middle line:84%
We should be very
clear about this,

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:39.620 align:middle line:84%
probably for rape and pillage
and for various other things.

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But of course in medieval
times there was always, always

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:44.660 align:middle line:90%
had recourse to confession.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you could
clean up your act.

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So he obviously had a very
deep seated sense of honor.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And for him, his
immediate background

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:58.780 align:middle line:84%
would have been the
background of Henry V

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and the War of
Agincourt and so on.

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So that would have been very
closely in his mind, I think.

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:10.620 align:middle line:84%
For him that was his
historical period.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote down
the legends of Arthur

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:19.480 align:middle line:84%
using the Cistercian versions
of the Arthurian legends.

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's, so what's called
the Prose Lancelot and all

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.280 align:middle line:84%
the stories to do
with the grail,

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:33.970 align:middle line:84%
he made a version of them,
which was a very British version

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:38.560 align:middle line:84%
in of course that beautiful
late 15th century English, which

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:39.490 align:middle line:90%
we can still read.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not too difficult to read.

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And the things that
move him are the kinds

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:50.200 align:middle line:84%
of things that move soldiers
and warriors everywhere,

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.300 align:middle line:84%
which is that they feel
for their companions.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:53:00.240 align:middle line:84%
They feel the injustice of
what's going on in the world.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And so he presents this
incredibly noble, incredibly

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:07.450 align:middle line:84%
honorable set of men who
are fighting the worst

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:10.210 align:middle line:90%
kind of people in the world.

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the villains
are very villainous.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.852 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Barbarians.

00:53:13.852 --> 00:53:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: They are indeed.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.600 align:middle line:84%
They prison ladies
and beat them up

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and do all sorts
of terrible things.

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we get this
ultimate flowering

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:25.540 align:middle line:84%
of the romantic chivalry
that has been associated

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.910 align:middle line:90%
with Arthur over so many years.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:33.400 align:middle line:10%
And he presents this
most extraordinary story,

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.070 align:middle line:10%
which of course begins
to come up to the grail.

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And the grail legend in
Malory is of course the sign

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that everything is going
to go to hell in a handcart

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:42.880 align:middle line:90%
very soon.

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Because of course all the
Knights leave Camelot.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:47.110 align:middle line:90%
They go out on the grail quest.

00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Very few come back.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And the whole administration
begins to be very rocky.

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And so of course the
title of this book

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.800 align:middle line:90%
is the "Morte d'Arthur."

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And the very last part of the
story is the death of Arthur

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and how he is betrayed and
how Guinevere and Lancelot are

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:09.280 align:middle line:90%
betrayed by the Orkney clan.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:14.770 align:middle line:10%
And it ends up with
Lancelot fighting

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:16.780 align:middle line:10%
against his very best
friend, King Arthur.

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very sad love
triangle in that story.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But he still somehow brings
that story up another notch.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Because when Arthur at the
end is fighting Mordred,

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:35.170 align:middle line:90%
he does not die.

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:38.920 align:middle line:84%
He passes out of this
life into another manner.

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And as he says, I shall not
say that King Arthur is dead.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I get chills
again when you say that.

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.490 align:middle line:10%
And if you're looking at it
as one big metaphor, when

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.740 align:middle line:10%
you talk about the knights
going out and very few

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:53.470 align:middle line:10%
returning, when it comes
to that journey of marrying

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:56.210 align:middle line:10%
the higher and the lower
minds within ourselves,

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.740 align:middle line:10%
within our own
journeying, it's very rare

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:04.990 align:middle line:10%
that a person actually
indeed completes that journey

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:07.690 align:middle line:10%
and really integrates.

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, I think
the thing that, as I say,

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I've said before, is that
this is not our quest.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not our individual
quest that matters.

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:22.060 align:middle line:84%
It is our collective
quest that matters.

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:27.920 align:middle line:10%
And I know that Joseph Campbell
spoke about finding your myth

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.400 align:middle line:10%
and living your myth and so on.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.300 align:middle line:10%
But actually we don't
live it for ourselves.

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.300 align:middle line:10%
We live it for others.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think for Arthur
that's really true.

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and yet we as
individuals want to participate

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.940 align:middle line:90%
in the story.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to
find our own way.

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that's
beautiful about this

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:48.770 align:middle line:84%
is because you're talking about
human virtues basically, valor

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and courage and devotion and
love and all of these things

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:54.410 align:middle line:84%
that have become
synonymous with legend.

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Those virtues are things that
we are trying to now wake up

00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:58.910 align:middle line:90%
to and reinstill.

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So there are many people who
have gone on this journey

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.690 align:middle line:90%
and not made it back.

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:05.000 align:middle line:84%
The opportunity to
go on that journey

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and make it through now,
individually and collectively,

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd say we're closer to than we
have been in hundreds of years.

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MATTHEWS: There is
always hope for everything.

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I would never say, never.

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely, so
looking at from a pop culture

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.510 align:middle line:84%
point of view, lots of
books have been written,

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.330 align:middle line:84%
making movies, TV miniseries,
full length series,

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and so forth have been made
about the life of King Arthur

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.134 align:middle line:90%
and Guinevere and so forth.

00:56:29.134 --> 00:56:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Are there any that
you actually enjoyed?

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.580 align:middle line:90%


00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Or is there one you
might prefer over others?

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:40.342 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: Well, no.

00:56:40.342 --> 00:56:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I thought that
might be your answer.

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: I'll be very
clear about that, no.

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So John is a much
fairer man than me.

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:52.507 align:middle line:84%
He's fair to a fault. And he'll
always find something to enjoy.

00:56:52.507 --> 00:56:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
would he recommend?

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: So he will always
find something good to say.

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But no, I haven't personally
enjoyed them a great deal.

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I think of the things
that have happened

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:08.845 align:middle line:90%
in the last few decades.

00:57:08.845 --> 00:57:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And John Boorman's
"Excalibur" I did enjoy.

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It was completely over the
top and down the other side.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.256 align:middle line:84%
But it dealt with
the myth very well.

00:57:19.256 --> 00:57:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And so when the myth
is not well handled,

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:28.100 align:middle line:84%
when it comes into a very
paltry level of expression,

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:30.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so keen.

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in the
end, King Arthur is.

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:37.587 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: The myth
has to speak for itself.

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And if the myth isn't
allowed to speak

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:46.434 align:middle line:84%
or it's been put into a very
low position in the story,

00:57:46.434 --> 00:57:47.600 align:middle line:90%
the story doesn't come over.

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.058 align:middle line:84%
The storytelling
doesn't come over.

00:57:49.058 --> 00:57:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the myth that excites us.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.291 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it doesn't mean
that historical personages,

00:57:54.291 --> 00:57:56.540 align:middle line:84%
that they have found remains
of, that there are little

00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:00.710 align:middle line:84%
references to and such,
those people existed.

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And that people have
attributed those traits to them

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:05.360 align:middle line:90%
is part of the myth, right?

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Oh, yes,
this happens all the time.

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:12.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a myth that is given
to being appropriated.

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.350 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So how has this
journey affected yours

00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:17.790 align:middle line:10%
and John's life, particularly
John since it's been his

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:20.300 align:middle line:10%
lifelong passion?

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.230 align:middle line:10%
>> MATTHEWS: It's been
the ongoing focus.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's the thing we've
shared most together.

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So we both worked
in the library.

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And we obviously saw each
other but didn't know much

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:36.667 align:middle line:90%
about each other.

00:58:36.667 --> 00:58:38.000 align:middle line:90%
I went into the library one day.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking in
the canteen to someone

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:43.970 align:middle line:84%
about the Mabinogion,
the early Welsh

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:47.010 align:middle line:84%
legends, which of course
some of which are Arthurian.

00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I overheard
them and said, oh, I

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.190 align:middle line:90%
know about the Mabinogion.

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it was actually the
cause of our coming together.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.410 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So this has been
a very important page indeed.

00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: It's been quite
an important story for us.

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, we only
have another, just a minute.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.559 align:middle line:84%
And you've written a couple
of other books recently

00:59:04.559 --> 00:59:06.350 align:middle line:84%
of other subjects that
have fascinated you.

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Just give us a little
tease about what you're

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:11.300 align:middle line:90%
doing right now, where you are.

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.450 align:middle line:10%
>> MATTHEWS: OK, so I have
lots of hats and write lots

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:17.360 align:middle line:10%
of different, about
different topics and so on.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:20.192 align:middle line:84%
So the book that's coming
out is the last book

00:59:20.192 --> 00:59:22.400 align:middle line:84%
of the grail, which John
and I have written together.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.750 align:middle line:10%
So we've actually,
with Gareth Knight,

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:28.280 align:middle line:10%
have translated a
13th century grail

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:31.040 align:middle line:10%
text called "The
Elucidation," which

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:35.360 align:middle line:10%
is an alternative version of
the grail story, which tells us

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.450 align:middle line:10%
about how the
wasteland came about

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:39.990 align:middle line:10%
and what we can do about it.

00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really, really happy
that that book is coming out.

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:47.450 align:middle line:84%
That's been five years on
the road and a lot of work.

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So I hope people are
going to be excited

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.794 align:middle line:90%
at the new research in that.

00:59:51.794 --> 00:59:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, we have
something wonderful to look

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.280 align:middle line:90%
forward to.

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So Caitlin, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:59.622 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, I
have all these years

00:59:59.622 --> 01:00:00.830 align:middle line:90%
thought your name is Caitlin.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Because in America, we
take this lovely name.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.730 align:middle line:90%
And we call it Caitlin.

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:06.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:07.400 align:middle line:90%
The Welsh pronunciation--

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: No, it's Gaelic.

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The Gaelic
pronunciation is "Kathleen."

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MATTHEWS: It's "Kathleen."

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.068 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's Kathleen, OK.

01:00:12.068 --> 01:00:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So even though I'm saying,
I think her name's Caitlin.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:16.250 align:middle line:90%
You corrected me.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:18.436 align:middle line:84%
>> MATTHEWS: Thank
you for getting that.

01:00:18.436 --> 01:00:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
so much, Kathleen,

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:23.800 align:middle line:84%
