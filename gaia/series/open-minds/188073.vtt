>> REGINA MEREDITH: Today
we're going to have a chat with

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:10%
the Archangels as channeled by
Joan Walker, a Gaia favorite.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:10%
This is going to be
a fascinating glimpse

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:10%
into our need to raise our
level of body consciousness.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of our shows focus on
the mind and spirit, but seldom

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:84%
on the consciousness
of our body.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to integrate
this whole thing.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.175 align:middle line:84%
Bring it down into
mass, right Joan?

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> JOAN WALKER: Absolutely.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Welcome back.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're
pretty in pink.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.392 align:middle line:90%
I love your little pink jacket.

For people who don't
already know you,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to do like the
30 second elevator description

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:90%
pitch of you.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Great.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So a number of
years ago, decades ago,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:84%
you were a Catholic
housewife and a mother,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:90%
and a businesswoman, right?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And suddenly
you got the urge.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Something was going on
that was tapping you,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
you needed to tap into.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:90%
You weren't quite sure what.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:84%
You came across a
book on channeling.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And voila, as I
recall the story--

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:84%
it's been a few years
since you told me--

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.058 align:middle line:84%
when it started, it kind
of shocked your husband.

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Well, it shocked me.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And you.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.875 align:middle line:90%
Because this other voice come--

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:84%
was he watching a football
game or something at the time,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:90%
as I recall?

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.956 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yeah.

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:90%
He was.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this voice
came out of your mouth

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're both like someone
that belched in public--

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%
what just happened?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.302 align:middle line:84%
Well, and needless to say,
he turned the ballgame off.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it has
been going on ever since.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But as I recall too,
you didn't really

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.167 align:middle line:90%
talk about this for a long time.

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
You didn't share it
with other people.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.247 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Oh, no, no, no.

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did you know
you were channeling?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Or did you think you might have
some mental illness going on?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.607 align:middle line:84%
Some people question
their sanity.

00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:02.287 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: No, I
didn't, bleeped or not.

00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because you were
otherwise were living a very

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:90%
functional life.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: I was.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:10%
You know, I had children
that I was raising

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:10%
and I had a business.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:90%
So I was a busy woman.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And basically,
I was out there searching

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:84%
because my religion
wasn't getting it for me.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And so I was
familiar with the Angelic Realm.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I was familiar with what
we used to term saints.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.267 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: You know,
that type of thing.

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't freaked out
about it or anything.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I was very grateful
for the guidance

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that I was being given, and
didn't know where it was going.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
well, we'll just

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:90%
go see what this is all about.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Am I correct in
remembering it was a couple

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:84%
of decades before you
really chose to share this--

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Oh, yes.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: With other people.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't to the level
that I challenge today.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:10%
It was mostly my guides
or that kind of thing.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't until
probably 20 years ago

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:10%
that Master Kuthumi and
some of the Archangels

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:10%
would start to come
and talk to me.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And they informed
me that this was for me,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
but that they were wanting
it shared with others.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:10%
>> WALKER: And that there was a
project for me in that regard.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
it all started.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you had some
people that became prominent,

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
such as Jim Self-- some
people know his work--

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.960 align:middle line:84%
who basically came to you
and you channeled for them.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And they based their body of
work on your channeling's.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so people aside
from those in direct contact

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
with you were getting your
information through others.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Because the
environment in which I lived

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:90%
wasn't conducive to doing that.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I was
still involved in my life.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Until I sold
my business after a while

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and started doing
this full-time.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Because it was just
what I was supposed to do.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're still
reluctant at times and think,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:84%
hey, guys when is
enough, enough?

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:90%
When do I get to quit?

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.495 align:middle line:90%
And they keep saying, not yet.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.620 align:middle line:84%
We'll let you know if you're
ever supposed to quit.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: You know, for me,
personally, it's so rewarding.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:90%
I have a very curious mind.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:84%
So then I think,
well, what about this?

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:90%
What about that?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.098 align:middle line:84%
And so the information
keeps coming.

00:04:43.098 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it keeps you
engaged and moving forward?

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: And moving forward.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.203 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And then
sometimes I think, well,

00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:50.432 align:middle line:90%
what else would I do?

00:04:50.432 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.967 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: You
know, this is fun.

00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I know everybody
gets a little lazy sometimes

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.592 align:middle line:90%
and think, I just want a break.

00:04:57.592 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter how
good it is, you know?

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: You know,
I do take a break.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's good.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: When I
get to that point.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to be talking
with the archangels today.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And let's ramp up
to it a little bit

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
in that when we were
prepping for this,

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I said what's the real
focus coming through now?

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And you were telling me that
that is what's coming through.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have a lot of other
questions, too, to ask them.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
But the notion that
we have not yet

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:84%
embodied a lot of that
spiritual knowledge

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that we've been seeking,
and depending on the person,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
connecting with to
various degrees,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:84%
is a problem, because
our bodies are

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:84%
needing to change for our own
future evolution, the iteration

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:84%
of what we will be
as a human species.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: That's true.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In fact, I just
thought of another question

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing down for them.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:10%
>> WALKER: Well, you know they
have told us that at the fall

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, the reason it
was so devastating to the Earth

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:10%
and to humanity is because
everything stopped,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:10%
and we were put into
an energetic paradigm

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:10%
of separation and fear.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The body didn't
function adequately.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:84%
The brain didn't process
complexity of thought.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The communication between
our different organs

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
where proper hormones and
other complexities of the body

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:90%
were all disconnected.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't have the
luxury of remembering

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:84%
who we are at that
divine level and how

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
we can communicate with
different dimensions

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:90%
and realms of consciousness.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So that was the challenge to
bring humanity and the Earth

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:90%
back into that type of mindset.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But there is such a thing as
support from your environment.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the human comes in.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason we
fell from consciousness

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:84%
was when we were
exploring matter,

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
making it more
dense to see if it

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
could maintain certain
dimensional frequency ranges.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
reconstruct that.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And that means the body
itself, because this

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:90%
is our vehicle in this realm.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, you and I years ago were
in a little conference that

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:90%
had to do with the origins.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It was a private conference, the
origins of the human species.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And what you're saying overlays
a lot with the information

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I had been given
30 years ago also.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And this whole notion that--

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like the
word higher and lower--

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.780 align:middle line:84%
a, let's say, a lighter
dimensional intelligence

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
merged into this
material world, causing

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
so much confusion,
so much damage,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:84%
creating a two for one species
that could be almost considered

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:90%
a hybrid species.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we have been
traumatized from the beginning.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.113 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Oh, absolutely.

00:08:13.113 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I'm going to
talk to the beings about that

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And also about the
subsequent traumatizations

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:84%
that have occurred
throughout our history

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:84%
when we go through these
cycles of destruction,

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
where whole civilizations
are lost at a time.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:84%
And when do we get
off this wheel?

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Or do we?

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Or do we have to
graduate beyond Earth?

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Is this just what
Earth offers us?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Well, that
didn't happen overnight.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have to reconstruct those
refined states of consciousness

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:84%
in matter, as well as
within our soul spirit.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:90%
So this takes time.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
It takes evolution of
generation after generation

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.280 align:middle line:90%
after generation.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have such as humans
an impact on our environment

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and on the Earth itself, because
our bodies are part of that.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So it stands to reason as
we raise the consciousness

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:84%
into more refined
states, that the body has

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
to change and alter
its consciousness,

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:36.400 align:middle line:84%
follow our consciousness,
and begin to reintegrate

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.753 align:middle line:90%
in a merged, unified way.

00:09:38.753 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
makes total sense,

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
because we never did merge
properly to begin with.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: No.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have
been disintegrated from

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:84%
the beginning, which has caused
us problems on many levels.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:84%
To say nothing of the
sheer conscious survival

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:84%
level of the body just
trying to survive literally,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
trying to keep itself
alive and in the game.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And then this fast
soul complex that

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
lives far beyond time and
space, that has no such fear,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and the clashing of
those almost two entities

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:84%
living in the same
vehicle has been something

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:84%
that, well, I wanted
to ask you this,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
because we've talked about it
on the phone, that makes Earth

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:90%
such a special needs project.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: It is.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:90%
It is beautiful.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Originally, it was created
to emanate those more

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:90%
refined frequencies in matter.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And the matter wasn't
what we have today.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it became more
dense over the many years

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.885 align:middle line:90%
of construction.

00:10:41.885 --> 00:10:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: As we've
reconstructed.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's about learning to not
only hold your consciousness

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:84%
at certain levels, but
to enhance the body.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So the body, you have to change
the neurology, the physiology,

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.150 align:middle line:90%
and psychology of the body.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, it was
all tweaked to begin with,

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
but never to refine enough
level for what we need today.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Absolutely.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is a big deal.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And here, we never
talk about this.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: No,
because it's all--

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, I don't care
what religion you are.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
You know where your interest
lies, that isn't talked about.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Your soul is talked about.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Your spirit is talked about.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And how to raise
that consciousness.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.765 align:middle line:84%
But it's not talked
about, the body.

00:11:36.765 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The Earth itself
is a living being.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.813 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And it
has a consciousness.

00:11:43.813 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Vast consciousness.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Humans then can
start that communication,

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:56.120 align:middle line:84%
that energetic flow through
the body into the Earth.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:03.303 align:middle line:84%
And then receive from the Earth
what it needs to nourish it.

00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And our awareness needs
to expand to the extent

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that we really truly begin
embracing and understanding

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that this is not a
material vehicle.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a vehicle made up
of information and light

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:90%
And that can be quickly moved.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Oh, yes.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very quickly
advanced once we, a, get it,

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.917 align:middle line:84%
and then use some of the
tools available to us.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't even know
what we are and we still

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
think we're a sack of meat, not
a lot of progress can be made.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So it was important to shift
the consciousness first.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And the key to that is
that mental, emotional body

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:84%
moderating your thoughts
and your feelings,

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
creates your reality.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:90%
So you have to become aware.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: And choose.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to know
you have a choice.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.197 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And most
people don't know that.

00:13:03.197 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, they don't.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And they don't
know that they can change

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.850 align:middle line:90%
their reality.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
They think, well,
this is my life.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it a bummer?

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you don't
like it, change it.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
You are a creative
being of light.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.483 align:middle line:84%
You know so many people think,
oh, yeah, I'm a being of light.

00:13:23.483 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I'm feeling.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm waking up with aches, pains,
feel nauseous, or whatever.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.848 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is
we truly, truly are.

00:13:29.848 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: You truly are.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: On a level down to
the atomic level in physics.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.810 align:middle line:84%
We are just light
and information.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Every cell.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Every part of you.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:90%
is life.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's time
to start owning that,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and owning our responsibility,
and the privilege of that

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:90%
choice to change it.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.852 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And so it may not
happen in this generation,

00:13:51.852 --> 00:13:53.480 align:middle line:90%
or the next, or the next.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.547 align:middle line:90%
But it's happening--

00:13:54.547 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's beginning.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Slowly.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:90%
It's beginning.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.257 align:middle line:90%
People are out there searching.

00:13:59.257 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They are.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And people watching
this show are

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:84%
what you would call classically
those people at the forefront

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.730 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.262 align:middle line:84%
In marketing, they like to call
people early adopters, meaning,

00:14:10.262 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
they're exposed to
new information.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Say, let's explore this.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So everyone watching
is the beginning of the wave

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:90%
of the understanding.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so I have notes
that go all over the map.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And what usually
happens is once we

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.210 align:middle line:84%
get online with the
Archangels, they

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:84%
say something that
trips another thought.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:90%
So we'll see where we end up.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: OK.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So by the
time you come back,

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:84%
we'll have a surprising
unexpected conversation.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But it is going to
center initially

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:84%
around this conversation
about the body,

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and where the bodies headed,
and what it's going to take,

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and a glimpse into our
future as physical beings.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so whenever
you feel ready to go,

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.987 align:middle line:84%
we'll go ahead and bring online
whoever chooses to show up.

00:14:57.987 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
it's going to be yet.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.293 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes, I do.

00:15:01.293 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Who will
we be speaking with.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Lord Metatron,
who is a lord of light.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:90%
But he is much more than that.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And he oversees not just
Earth, but all physical realms

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:90%
of source.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.837 align:middle line:90%
And I like him.

00:15:16.837 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:90%
We've spoken before.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Yeah, he is a
awesome being of light.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to
being hooked up.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.395 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: OK.

00:15:25.395 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, Joan,
we'll give you a moment.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: OK.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Greetings.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:90%
It is I, Metatron.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:90%
I am delighted to be here today.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I am part of a massive
collective consciousness that

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
oversees all realms of
form, bringing it back

00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to its original state
of consciousness.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So today I would like to
talk about the importance

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.710 align:middle line:90%
of the human body.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It is such a beautiful
Christed vessel.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And that awareness,
that consciousness

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
has been disengaged for a very
long time in your history.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
It's time now to
reintegrate that awareness,

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness, that light,
and bring Earth and all humans

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
back to their intended
purpose as a reflection

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:90%
of the divine light.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So it stands to reason
that we are not just

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
talking about your
consciousness, your soul

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
journey, or the soul spirit
merge that occurs as you

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:90%
raise your consciousness.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But now we have to involve
the physical realm itself.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And we begin with the
body consciousness.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:84%
The body that you have in
your possession at this time

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:90%
was created at the fall.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It was created to
exemplify and experience

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
separation, and paradigms of
fear through that separation.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So it must be brought back
into a state of communication

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and of unity, consciousness.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And that cannot happen until
the body's consciousness is

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:84%
You, as that divine
soul spirit, have

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.040 align:middle line:84%
been able to raise your
level of consciousness

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:90%
to certain degrees.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So now you must teach your body,
the vehicle, the dense vehicle,

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
to follow your consciousness and
to begin to have communication

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
within the bodily system,
within the organs of the body,

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:84%
within the fluids of the
body, and bring in more light

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
so that the body
has a consciousness,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:90%
the Earth has a consciousness.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:84%
But the human element,
the human divine form

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:90%
has a spirit and a soul.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And so it's through
that evolution

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.110 align:middle line:84%
of that soul's
consciousness that it

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
begins to lead the
realms of form, the body.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the body transmit
that to the Earth.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth responds and
begins to alter the Earth

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So the environment, then,
is conducive to what you now

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
call an evolution into
that fifth dimension, which

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
is a more refined
dimension, that

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:90%
is based in unity and love.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have an
environment to hold that.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So it stands to reason
that you as a creator being

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:84%
have to create that
through your consciousness.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:90%
And I have several questions.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry to
interrupt you, but I

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.140 align:middle line:84%
want to ask this now
because it remains

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
a mystery to me and
probably everybody watching.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
notion that if you

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:84%
are looking at us
on a atomic level,

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.010 align:middle line:84%
there isn't anything
there there.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:84%
There is a concept and there
is this kind of a form.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:90%
But there is no material to us.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:84%
On an atomic level, there's
very little material.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And so how is it that we can
perceive and live in something

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:90%
that feels so dense and solid?

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:84%
What is this illusion that runs
through the five senses that

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
allows us to experience such
incredible solidity or density?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: It's at an energetic
level, at an atomic level.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Every cell vibrates to a
certain frequency range.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And when there is
distortion and fragmentation

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:84%
within that energetic
at the atomic level,

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
then it provides an environment
for illusion to exist.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This
makes perfect sense.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.732 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't I already know this?

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: You knew it.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:90%
You forgot it.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.408 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I forgot it.

00:21:09.408 --> 00:21:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that makes perfect sense.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you're going
to experience anything

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
in the range of
refinement or density

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.155 align:middle line:84%
according to the
level of consciousness

00:21:19.155 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
as pervading that
space or entity.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Exactly.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So now you understand
the importance

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
of altering the physicality and
the changing that fragmentation

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to a more unified communication
system within the energetics

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.240 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
When that fragmentation
happened within your body

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:84%
at that molecular
state, in the body

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
there was fragmentation in
the neurology of the body.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.250 align:middle line:84%
The brain didn't
function properly.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't process complexities
of thought or awareness.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Not only the neurology,
but the physiology--

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.790 align:middle line:90%
there was no communication.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The aging process
happened very quickly.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
lot of distortion,

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.305 align:middle line:90%
and pain, and misery in that.

00:22:17.305 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
in the beginning.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: In the beginning.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: So then you had
this psychology which includes

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:90%
the mind and the emotions.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
There was great
fragmentation in that.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So there was a time
lapse in what you thought

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and how you felt, when they
should operate as a unit.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the most creative
part of the human form.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The ability to
feel and think simultaneously?

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And create a reality
in those more refined states

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:55.220 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and
realms, and dimensions.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So would you say then
that the beings on this planet,

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:84%
the humans who have chosen
to cluster themselves

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:84%
into a spiritual environment,
often in isolation,

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to alter their
frequencies to the point where

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:84%
they can maybe even appear
to be walking through a wall,

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.730 align:middle line:84%
this is just a raising of the
frequencies to a more normal

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
level of where our
bodies should be?

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Correct.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But there's another part of that
that you have to understand.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Humanity is the collective.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And they need
humans, other humans,

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:90%
to change the environment.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
You imprint the collective
consciousness of all humanity

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:84%
regardless of the
state of consciousness

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:84%
of some of the humans
that occupy Earth.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.930 align:middle line:84%
You then alter the
consciousness of the Earth

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.420 align:middle line:84%
through the
elemental communities

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and through your ability
to create more effectively.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is the
Earth requesting--

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that
It's to their benefit

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:84%
for the human realm to
refine our own frequencies

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But is it as though she's
acting as a patient grandmother

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:90%
waiting for this to occur--

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that she also
can be freed to raise her own

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:37.440 align:middle line:84%
frequencies as the host of all
of the animals and kingdoms

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Absolutely.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Now you have it.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So one is dependent
on the other.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.860 align:middle line:84%
There is no separation
that can be present

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
as the refinement through the
different dimensions happen.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:84%
The whole way of perceiving
time is altered dramatically.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when we go into
these more refined states

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
of body consciousness, time
is going to pass differently

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.347 align:middle line:90%
or feel different?

00:25:06.347 --> 00:25:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because I've
been told it in the ancient,

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:84%
ancient past it moved very
differently when we were

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:90%
of a different frequency level.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Absolutely.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So basically what you
have is very linear

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and it's very dense.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:90%
You have past, present, future.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Very little present.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is occupied
with past and not

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
creating that, or getting
out of it in some way,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:90%
releasing yourself from it.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Or you're occupied with what's
going to happen tomorrow

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
or how is this
going to affect me?

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.500 align:middle line:84%
That's another big paradigm
of that linear third, fourth

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:90%
dimension is survival.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And that is a huge
draw on the consciousness.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So as you begin to educate
yourself and the body

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.560 align:middle line:84%
into these more
refined states, and you

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:84%
are capable of holding that
refinement within yourself,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:84%
then you teach the body
to become more unified.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:21.540 align:middle line:84%
That's when time shifts
into another paradigm,

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:90%
shifts it's more circular.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.960 align:middle line:84%
There are no missed
opportunities.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in the present.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The past-- and
you're experiencing

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that now if you don't remember
what happened yesterday.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And the future is
yet to be created.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: So you have to
operate now so there are no

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.900 align:middle line:90%
missed opportunities.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Everything is circular.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:52.380 align:middle line:84%
If you choose not
to take a path--

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and it is in the highest
interest of you as a human--

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that'll come back around
in a different sequence

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and draw your attention
again until you act on it.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is so critical.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:10%
This is something that's
been on my mind a lot--

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:10%
and I've been trying
to share doing

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.760 align:middle line:10%
lectures here and there--
this notion of the now

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.240 align:middle line:10%
and that all things
are created now.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.850 align:middle line:84%
They're not created from
yesterday or tomorrow.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And just what you said, it
was wonderful validation,

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:84%
this preoccupation with our
survival, our well-being

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:84%
in the past and in
the future is so

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:33.813 align:middle line:84%
blocking our ability to create
what we actually desire now.

00:27:33.813 --> 00:27:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Absolutely.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we can't have
that outcome if you're not

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.532 align:middle line:90%
doing it right this minute.

00:27:37.532 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right this minute.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: It is so imperative
that you understand that you

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:84%
are a creative being and what
you create in the now actually

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:90%
is reflected in your reality.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So you have choice in every
thought that you think

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and every feeling
that you invoke.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like a
situation, it's up to you

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.920 align:middle line:90%
to change it.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you change
it, everything shifts,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and you hold a different
light frequency,

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:84%
you hold a different
state of consciousness.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to have more
unity within the system.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And you have more value for you.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:36.890 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing, not having
an awareness of value in self

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:90%
as a human.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:44.328 align:middle line:84%
You are like no other species
in the creative realms.

00:28:44.328 --> 00:28:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us a little
more about ourselves.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We love hearing about
how special we are.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: You are, but
you've forgotten your words.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's OK,
you're helping us remember.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: In that denseness
when you are so engaged

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:84%
in the reality of form, then you
become really engaged in that

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:90%
survival mechanism.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And because you can't
create effectively--

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:84%
your mental emotional
body is fragmented--

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that's the key right there,
that's your creative force

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:84%
within form, within
levels of you.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.480 align:middle line:90%
So you miss-create.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And so then you're
told, oh, you're bad.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.670 align:middle line:90%
You're less than.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.760 align:middle line:10%
You need somebody to
come along and save you.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:10%
Humans have to save humans.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Every human that is embodied
on this planet today

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:90%
is unique unto themselves.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.120 align:middle line:90%
No two are alike.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.060 align:middle line:90%
So you have a piece.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And then if you don't like
what's happening in your life,

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:90%
change it.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention to your thoughts.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention to the feelings.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Because that is what
manifests in your life.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: So if you have an
awareness that you are not

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:84%
special, but unique, you were
created for a unique purpose

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.850 align:middle line:84%
of raising human consciousness,
you have a piece in that.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.772 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to you to
create it in your life.

00:30:32.772 --> 00:30:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's get
down to some nuts and bolts.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So here we have this
vehicle that tells voltage.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.753 align:middle line:84%
We have voltage on
a cellular level.

00:30:40.753 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Absolutely.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.628 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Micro volts.

00:30:42.628 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, when you
put all these cells together,

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:90%
a lot more voltage.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet we run
around saying, I'm so tired,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm so drained, my
batteries drained.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's how humans talk
about our own energy field

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
so often is that we're
tired and we're drained.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:84%
If we have a natural abundant
supply of voltage in our cells,

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.750 align:middle line:90%
first, is that being dampened?

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And number two,
if we do have it,

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:84%
why aren't we able to utilize
it or access it properly?

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Well,
you're in an illusion.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:84%
You're in a lower
frequency range.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.390 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:25.890 align:middle line:84%
When you say I am, you are
creating a state of being.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you
say I'm so tired--

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:29.565 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: So exhausted.

00:31:29.565 --> 00:31:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you know that in your
awareness, what should you do?

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, change the
thought and language first,

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:40.484 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:31:40.484 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes, right.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And create something that
results that can give you

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:90%
an energetic influx.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:56.040 align:middle line:84%
If that means take a nap, if
that means take a deep breath

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and alter whatever
thoughts are creating

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:84%
the stress in your system
where the brain is not

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:84%
processing thoughts
adequately or consciously.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it is immediately
connected to a feeling.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling is brought
through the body consciousness.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: So when you feel
like you're debilitated--

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:90%
first of all, what caused it?

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Is it recurrent thoughts
of being less than or not

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.710 align:middle line:90%
able to manage your life?

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or just living
a repetitive life that

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have creativity
and joy in it.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Exactly.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So you have to get
real with yourself,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.920 align:middle line:84%
be honest with yourself,
and not allow that to go on.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So we go back to that
mental and emotional body.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:56.942 align:middle line:90%
That's your creative force.

00:32:56.942 --> 00:32:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So instead--

00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: That's what
puts it into reality.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.878 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We might just
say something as simple when

00:33:01.878 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
we're tired as I'm going to take
a couple of really refreshing

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:84%
deep breaths and I'm going
to feel alive and vibrant,

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and just change it--

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Exactly.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That quickly.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And then make
sure that the body is getting

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.710 align:middle line:90%
adequate rest.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.430 align:middle line:84%
In these times of
change and transmission,

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:84%
all these light frequencies
that are coming onto the planet

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:84%
today are taking a toll on
the fragmented human form.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So the more that you
can teach that body

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:84%
to be open to that influx,
but to also make corrections--

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.125 align:middle line:84%
so make sure you're
getting enough rest.

00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is a tough
one for humans because we have

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.560 align:middle line:84%
programmed ourselves that we're
supposed to be busy little

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:84%
beavers as long as there's
light out, and go, go, go,

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.793 align:middle line:90%
especially in the West.

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And in indigenous cultures,
there's more rest.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:84%
But among the people in the
Western modern civilization,

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.250 align:middle line:84%
it's almost seen as a
detriment, as you're

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.590 align:middle line:84%
a lazy person for
example, if you take time

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to just fall asleep in
the middle of the day.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And everyone I hear
is saying, god,

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.409 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like I need
more rest, more sleep.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps we need
to hear what you just

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:90%
said reinforced a little bit.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:84%
No, take your time to
sleep wherever you can.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Well,
and it's a choice.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:25.139 align:middle line:84%
Just like you get up in the
morning and if you have a job,

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.090 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
you're doing, you

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.940 align:middle line:84%
have a basic schedule
that you want

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:84%
to keep during that day to be
effective in what you're doing.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So where is it in that that
you spend private time for you,

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.179 align:middle line:90%
recharging, nourishing you?

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:51.270 align:middle line:84%
If that means you have to get
up an hour earlier to recharge

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:56.159 align:middle line:84%
and center your
energy in your heart.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.760 align:middle line:90%
This is so misunderstood.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:06.120 align:middle line:84%
How can you love another
if you don't love yourself?

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.017 align:middle line:84%
And for many of you
that's very hard.

00:35:09.017 --> 00:35:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, for reasons we
talked about in the beginning.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:90%
So take some time for you.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Nourish yourself.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Take some of your off time.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:90%
What is it that nourishes you?

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And if that means go for a hike,
if it means sit by a brook,

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:35.540 align:middle line:84%
if it means getting
a massage, whatever,

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.950 align:middle line:84%
put that into your
priority list.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:84%
If you like to be
creative, what is

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.690 align:middle line:84%
it that really feeds you
and gives you energy, not

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.250 align:middle line:90%
detracts from that energy?

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go into the subject
of the glandular system

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:57.770 align:middle line:84%
in the reintegration or
integration about the gland

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:90%
that working properly.

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Right now, on this
planet, it seems

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.670 align:middle line:84%
there are issues with a
number of glands going on.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:84%
We have problems
with our secretions

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.850 align:middle line:90%
of dopamine and serotonin.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:84%
We have problems with the
glands communicating properly

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.460 align:middle line:90%
with the pituitary and back.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And how do we begin bringing
our glandular system

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:90%
into alignment?

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Well, first of
all, when you are in stress,

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and negativity, and survival,
you create hormones that are

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.290 align:middle line:90%
not helpful.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Adrenaline, and a lot of you are
addicted to an adrenaline rush.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is true.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And that is very
debilitating to the body

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:84%
itself, because it limits
the body's ability to produce

00:36:54.380 --> 00:37:00.460 align:middle line:84%
the hormones and change the
molecular system at a cellular

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So are you saying
that the cortisol output is

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:84%
such that it's so dense that it
kind of blocks the production

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.940 align:middle line:84%
of the fine spectrum and
balance of the other hormones?

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
adequate communication

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:90%
between the glands.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that the glands
do not produce adequately

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:28.490 align:middle line:84%
the hormone that keeps it
in health and well-being.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:32.268 align:middle line:84%
And this is also related
to the body consciousness.

00:37:32.268 --> 00:37:33.185 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:33.185 --> 00:37:33.985 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: When you
have fragmentation

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and you're operating on
those stress hormones,

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:48.170 align:middle line:84%
because they agitate you,
you're alert, and you're moving,

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:53.690 align:middle line:84%
when you're operating there,
it limits what that gland can

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:84%
produce that creates the
health and well-being.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.040 align:middle line:84%
That is a really clean,
clear excellent explanation.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
We all know that we should
not be cortisol junkies going

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.930 align:middle line:90%
on adrenal rushes.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:84%
But most people,
it's not explained

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.980 align:middle line:90%
exactly how that works.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought
that was very useful.

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So avoiding stress,
learning how to do

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.490 align:middle line:84%
what we need to do, whether
by way of breathing, or yoga,

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:84%
or walking, or meditation
keep those stress levels down

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.970 align:middle line:84%
so we can create that
fine array of hormones.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's go to
something very controversial

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.360 align:middle line:90%
right now on this planet, food.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
controversial topics.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're divided
on every level.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But we've never been
more divided on food.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:45.260 align:middle line:84%
So the food sources
that will take us

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:90%
into this more refined state.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Is that just down
to the individual?

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Well, basically
it depends on your body type

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:90%
and where your consciousness is.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.380 align:middle line:90%
That's another disconnect.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.810 align:middle line:90%


00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Humans, on the most part, don't
communicate with their body.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, we drag
it around with us.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes, it's just there.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So the body has needs
and the body has likes

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:19.940 align:middle line:90%
through the tastes.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, there has been a lot
of teaching around getting rid

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.050 align:middle line:90%
of the five senses.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:31.160 align:middle line:84%
You can not raise the
body consciousness

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.720 align:middle line:90%
without those five senses.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Please elaborate
a little bit more.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: So it is through
the smell, taste, touch, sight.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:90%
All of these things.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's very individual.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have so
much compromised food

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.580 align:middle line:90%
that do not hold light energy.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't nourish the body.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well, I
need more, more, more.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And the body gets bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But it still is not satisfied,
because it is eliminating

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:19.780 align:middle line:90%
more and more light.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:90%
So you have to eat more natural.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Things that
are not so hybrid.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Packaged
in boxes, so to speak.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Right.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
listen to the body.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is hard,
because people here,

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.290 align:middle line:84%
they see the news reports
on this study, that study.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.210 align:middle line:90%
A new book comes out--

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:48.820 align:middle line:84%
you should only eat plants
and drink plant juices,

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and that is the only
way to move forward.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand
there is a level

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.590 align:middle line:84%
of refinement in these
beautiful, live, colorful

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.010 align:middle line:90%
enzyme rich plants.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think no matter
what for most people

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.380 align:middle line:90%
having that in the diet works.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But then others are, no,
that goes all the way

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.110 align:middle line:90%
to a pure carnivore diet.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat any plants.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Only eat meat.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.807 align:middle line:90%
You'll lose weight really fast.

00:41:11.807 --> 00:41:12.890 align:middle line:90%
And everything in between.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And people are so confused
because the weight has

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.080 align:middle line:84%
ballooned up, the energy
levels have gone down,

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and so everyone's grasping at
whatever the newest straw is.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Well, here again
we go back to the body type

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and the body consciousness,
and what the body needs.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:37.560 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a balance in the
nutritional value of the foods

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.750 align:middle line:90%
that you ingest.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So you can't have strictly
one thing or the other,

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:84%
because the body will
not be satisfied.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And you will not
maintain or achieve

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:55.320 align:middle line:90%
what you think that you should.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And that cannot become a
lifestyle of communication with

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:00.810 align:middle line:90%
the body.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:05.550 align:middle line:84%
The look of the food, the
feel of it in your mouth,

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:90%
the texture, the taste of it.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:14.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to reorient and reteach
the body to pay attention

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:20.966 align:middle line:84%
to these things so that you
know what the body needs.

00:42:20.966 --> 00:42:21.950 align:middle line:90%
The body tells you.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: So if
you're craving bananas,

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.770 align:middle line:84%
you're craving spinach,
you're craving a certain type

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.450 align:middle line:90%
of fish--

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.832 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ice cream.

00:42:34.832 --> 00:42:36.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Of course.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's all in moderation, and
balance, and paying attention.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So you may go weeks and
really desire spinach.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Eat it.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of those weeks,
then the body's satisfied

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.843 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, now we can
experience something else.

00:42:55.843 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I
agree with that.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I see that the body goes
through these desire cycles.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And these
pushing away cycles,

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that even aside
from all the healthy foods,

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.520 align:middle line:84%
some of the what are considered
less healthy foods like

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.340 align:middle line:84%
chocolate, or ice
cream, or cookies,

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.850 align:middle line:84%
or so forth that there's a
period where the body simply is

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.280 align:middle line:84%
trying to reject those
things, doesn't want them.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes if
we are continuing

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:25.860 align:middle line:84%
to get caught on
this carb cycle,

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:29.310 align:middle line:84%
it seems that more has to
do with our emotional brain

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:33.720 align:middle line:84%
activity and maybe depression
or a lack of proper dopamine

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.590 align:middle line:90%
levels in the brain.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Correct.

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So an excess in refined
sugar, an excess

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:43.110 align:middle line:84%
in salts that you
do not take notice

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:84%
of in certain processed foods
or certain prepared foods.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:57.270 align:middle line:84%
That upsets the equilibrium of
the molecular chemical system

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.200 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And so you think you need
more, more, more, more.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: No, you
need a balance.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And you need to recognize
that these foods disengage

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:22.050 align:middle line:84%
the proper flow of the chemicals
in the body, the hormones,

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.360 align:middle line:90%
the hormone function.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So you get on a cycle where you
are addicted to these things.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:36.420 align:middle line:84%
They're satisfying in some
way to the lower denser

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.720 align:middle line:90%
form of you.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And no
good comes of it.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: No, it's
very destructive.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to get
that part on the table.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that,
each body's needs

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.910 align:middle line:84%
are different when
you're playing

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:54.223 align:middle line:84%
in the spectrum of natural
foods naturally produced--

00:44:54.223 --> 00:44:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Absolutely.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: By the Earth.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And you have to
reorient your senses into what

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.060 align:middle line:84%
is pleasing, the
taste, the textures.

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.340 align:middle line:84%
It's very important,
because you have

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to teach the body to
reorient itself out

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:20.850 align:middle line:84%
of those destructive things
to have more balance so

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.900 align:middle line:90%
that it can function in unity.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's speak about
on a psycho spiritual level

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:34.080 align:middle line:84%
perhaps some of the ways in
which we can begin consciously

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.520 align:middle line:84%
choosing to allow integration
better between our organs,

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and our glands, and
our bodies systems.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Are there any that
you could tell us

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:47.520 align:middle line:84%
kind of quickly simple
little visualizations

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.090 align:middle line:84%
that we might do that can
begin integrating these things?

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Well, stay
conscious when you're eating.

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Don't just sit down and eat it.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Look at the colors.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Look at the textures of the
different things on your plate.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And then take time to
taste it and to feel what

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.870 align:middle line:90%
that feels like in your body.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Your body will tell you.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.760 align:middle line:90%
So pay attention.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.250 align:middle line:84%
When your body is
like, eh, I'm full.

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.790 align:middle line:90%
This just doesn't appeal to me.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Is it the color?

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Is it the texture?

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Is it the taste?

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so this is all
refining data so that we can

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.020 align:middle line:84%
start leading ourselves
onto a much clearer path.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It starts bringing the
integration of these body

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.360 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.930 align:middle line:84%
The organs and the glands
begin to work together,

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:48.720 align:middle line:84%
honoring as you say, the need
to rest, or be massaged, or take

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.840 align:middle line:90%
care of ourselves.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.740 align:middle line:84%
When that's calling to us, don't
shut it down and walk past it.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.873 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so these are
some really beginning points

00:46:56.873 --> 00:46:58.230 align:middle line:90%
for the body.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Please share with us
some more meaningful ways

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that anybody can begin
approaching this integration

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:07.800 align:middle line:90%
in terms of our--

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.440 align:middle line:90%


00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.600 align:middle line:90%
what am I trying to say here?

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, in terms of is
there a vision of ourselves

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.740 align:middle line:90%
that helps?

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like, to see ourselves
filling up with light

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.440 align:middle line:90%
as a little meditation.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:29.070 align:middle line:84%
To see our DNA take on
shimmering clean lines,

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.510 align:middle line:90%
spirals, and colors.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
you would recommend?

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Well, those
things are all helpful.

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
the day, you have

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:44.430 align:middle line:84%
to establish within yourself
what is right in your world

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.695 align:middle line:90%
and what needs to be changed.

00:47:46.695 --> 00:47:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very true.

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It takes the hard work and
not just visualization.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.750 align:middle line:90%
I hear you.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And here we're looking at a
time that is so stressed out,

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.933 align:middle line:90%
where people are so polarized.

00:47:56.933 --> 00:47:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And as you said
from the top, it's

00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:01.050 align:middle line:84%
our mind and emotions
that are actually

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.390 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are keeping
us disintegrated physically.

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
about that is you

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:12.090 align:middle line:84%
are influenced by the
outside circumstances

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:15.330 align:middle line:90%
that you did not create.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So don't take
responsibility for that.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.060 align:middle line:90%
See it for what it is.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:25.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a new energy coming
onto the Earth at this time.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:33.900 align:middle line:84%
There is a light frequency
that is being transmitted now

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.750 align:middle line:90%
from the more refined realms.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is being brought into
this form now to enlighten it.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And it is called a
field of transparency.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:49:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you are in this illusion
state and certain relationships

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:06.480 align:middle line:84%
or certain outside events,
you can see it for what it is,

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and that it has
no bearing on you.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:17.820 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't show you who you are.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It's an illusion
of the denseness

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:26.310 align:middle line:84%
of that particular dimensional
frequency and paradigm.

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we do ourselves
a disservice when we buy

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.780 align:middle line:84%
into these dysfunctional
discordant stories around us.

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes.

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's everywhere.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.120 align:middle line:90%
It's in the workplace.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:42.180 align:middle line:84%
It's in your socialization,
in your relationships.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.870 align:middle line:84%
It is so destructive,
this blame,

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to blame another for
your circumstance

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:55.970 align:middle line:84%
when you are part of the
creation of that circumstance.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:50:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there are things going
on the other side of the Earth

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have
any resonance with.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Is it up to you to fix it?

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:16.450 align:middle line:84%
It's up to you to be aware of
how you're reacting to that

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and how that is affecting
you and your ability

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.240 align:middle line:84%
to create more refined
states of awareness

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:30.940 align:middle line:84%
to where there is calm and
harmony within the system.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And magically,
what happens then?

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.980 align:middle line:84%
When you transmit
that, it goes into

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:44.530 align:middle line:84%
the collective consciousness
of humanity and the Earth,

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and very slowly begins to
transmit a different frequency

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.450 align:middle line:84%
into that collective
consciousness.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, is that going
to change overnight?

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But you are seeing
it very slowly where

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:08.620 align:middle line:84%
certain people in communities
change things that

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:10.960 align:middle line:90%
benefit the entire community.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.670 align:middle line:90%
They have an idea.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we could do this, or we
could have a farmer's market,

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and we could share
some of these things

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:25.120 align:middle line:84%
with people that aren't
able to have access to it.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.150 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds
of creative things

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that happen when you maintain
that center within yourself

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and are not affected by
your outside environment

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.290 align:middle line:90%
if it's negative or destructive.

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't reflect
who you really are.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is very important to
hold onto that consciousness.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So you have to cultivate
it and review it every day.

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:01.270 align:middle line:90%
Recognize it every day.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end of the day
you look and you say, yeah,

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:09.250 align:middle line:84%
wow, I was tempted to think
this or react this way,

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.050 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't.

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:11.230 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Or, I kind of missed
the mark today.

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But tomorrow, I'm
going to pay attention.

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's a massive
re-education process driven

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.170 align:middle line:84%
by self for our own
personal refinement.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And in that, it
affects the field

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:27.730 align:middle line:84%
which touches with others,
which collectively raises

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:29.020 align:middle line:90%
the field of consciousness.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Exactly.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:32.507 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, thank
you for all of that.

00:52:32.507 --> 00:52:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to
ask you another kind

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:35.760 align:middle line:90%
of controversial topic.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.750 align:middle line:10%
And it has to do
with the merging

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:42.970 align:middle line:10%
with artificial
intelligence and what's

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:46.900 align:middle line:10%
going on with technological
intelligence on the planet,

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:53.710 align:middle line:10%
and the potential interface
with human consciousness.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And my
question is, why?

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why would we do that?

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.770 align:middle line:90%
That's my question, too.

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Because,
let me tell you why.

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:12.070 align:middle line:84%
At this denser level with
lack of communication

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and the illusion that is within
the neurology of the body

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and the ability of the mind
to process unknowing of self,

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:31.120 align:middle line:84%
in the body you doubt
your creative abilities.

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And you always look outside
of you for something

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:39.250 align:middle line:84%
better, something
more intelligent

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that will suffice because
you are incapable of creating

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:47.860 align:middle line:90%
it yourself.

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:55.450 align:middle line:84%
What a huge disservice
to humanity.

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I
couldn't agree more.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:01.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I remember reading
a quote that was fascinating

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.270 align:middle line:84%
and it touches into
what you're saying.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:08.680 align:middle line:84%
It was saying, if a picture
is worth a thousand words,

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.980 align:middle line:84%
essentially a feeling is
worth a thousand thoughts.

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Exactly.

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because so much
subtle information is embedded

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.980 align:middle line:90%
in any given feeling.

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So much had to take
place within our aura

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:28.660 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have such a
complex array of information

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:32.380 align:middle line:84%
come in and result in a feeling
if you could only deconstruct

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:36.250 align:middle line:84%
it, which of course is not part
of artificial intelligence.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: No.

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we
denigrate that.

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: Yes,
because you doubt.

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:46.450 align:middle line:90%
What causes the doubt?

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:53.650 align:middle line:84%
What do you have to do to
be confident in yourself

00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:57.310 align:middle line:90%
as a creator being of light?

00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:04.100 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's missing in
that state of consciousness?

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:09.010 align:middle line:84%
What are you allowing
to further fragmentation

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:11.050 align:middle line:84%
in the mental and
emotional body?

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:17.110 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea the
power, the creative power,

00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:22.030 align:middle line:84%
within that particular
part of humanity.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Humans are unlike any other
species in the galaxy,

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.470 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:35.080 align:middle line:84%
They are capable not
only of creating a very

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:39.840 align:middle line:90%
refined dimensional frequency.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But they are capable of
using undifferentiated light

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:53.440 align:middle line:84%
of the creator of all that is,
bringing it through their body,

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and creating more light
at a more physical level,

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and transmitting that, and
altering more of the species,

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.220 align:middle line:90%
and altering a planet.

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.780 align:middle line:84%
This is not just about
raising consciousness.

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.940 align:middle line:90%
This is about raising the body.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:19.990 align:middle line:84%
It's about raising a
Christed planet that reflects

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:22.480 align:middle line:90%
the divinity of who you are.

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think that's
a lot for us to think about

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and for us to take in in
all of its beauty and glory.

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to
happen fast, like you say.

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not a quick fix.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.230 align:middle line:84%
But that is what's
available to us.

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:41.530 align:middle line:84%
That is our right
to choose and use.

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Exactly.

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
refine and develop.

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: And so my question to
you beloveds, all humans, why?

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And what are you waiting for?

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to
take the steps that

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:04.730 align:middle line:84%
are required to eliminate
this fragmentation, this one

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:07.820 align:middle line:84%
piece of fragmentation
in the human form,

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:12.370 align:middle line:84%
the mental emotional
body, and recognize

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:15.790 align:middle line:84%
the divine inner
self so that you can

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:18.910 align:middle line:90%
be confident in your creations?

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And you will look
forward in joy.

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.070 align:middle line:90%
But it takes an element--

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:28.150 align:middle line:90%
another element.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You have fire, water,
air, Earth, energy,

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.660 align:middle line:84%
but there is another
element that's

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.290 align:middle line:90%
coming into being very slowly.

00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the
element of love.

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Humans misperceive
that as an emotion.

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's brought
through the emotions.

00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very creative,
powerful element.

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And it is part of
any creation that

00:57:53.110 --> 00:58:00.200 align:middle line:84%
is done in that fifth
dimensional sequence and above.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So your duty now is to get
yourself to hold that frequency

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.720 align:middle line:84%
in that fifth dimensional
sequence stably

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.320 align:middle line:84%
so that you have
unity within yourself

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:21.820 align:middle line:90%
and you have love in your heart.

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:26.020 align:middle line:84%
First of you, because
it begins with you.

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you open that
heart and transmit it.

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:31.927 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And does that not
feel like embodied light?

00:58:31.927 --> 00:58:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Yes, of course.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because
it feels to me,

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:39.730 align:middle line:84%
it's like a rush of just that
love, that universal solvent,

00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:43.220 align:middle line:84%
like a rush of light
more than an emotion.

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: There's no separation
between love and light.

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, there you go.

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Well Metatron, we're
having so much fun.

00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And I never got to
most of the questions.

00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.900 align:middle line:10%
So we'll have to do this
another time, because you've

00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:59.440 align:middle line:10%
ended this for us I think on
such a powerful note and such

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.820 align:middle line:10%
an empowering note.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you for
choosing to come through Joan

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:05.620 align:middle line:90%
and join us today.

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And we will take
Joan back whenever

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:09.350 align:middle line:90%
you're ready to release her.

00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: I would like to
leave you with this one thought.

00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:18.930 align:middle line:90%
You have just begun.

00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And we are amazed at what
you are able to accomplish.

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.300 align:middle line:90%


00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:31.600 align:middle line:90%
So just continue.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:36.070 align:middle line:90%
We support you 100%.

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
on behalf of all of us.

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: You are very welcome.

00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Blessings.

00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:56.080 align:middle line:90%


00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Welcome back.

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: Well, hello.

00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hello.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, we don't
have any time for you.

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>> WALKER: That's OK.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.630 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We just
used the entire hour.

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: I was here
to deliver a message.

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:07.400 align:middle line:90%
I did my job.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank
you so much, Joan.

01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:11.812 align:middle line:84%
That was really very, very
powerful, very beautiful.

01:00:11.812 --> 01:00:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that I think all of us

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.890 align:middle line:84%
need to listen to
again and again.

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Because each time we
hear it, the information

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.960 align:middle line:84%
is going to be felt
on a different level.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.010 align:middle line:10%
>> WALKER: Yeah, these
things lately are transmitted

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:26.270 align:middle line:10%
and they're multilayered.

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: So as you can
absorb a certain layer,

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.640 align:middle line:90%
you get to another layer.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> WALKER: So maybe next
time when we talk, you know,

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:40.055 align:middle line:84%
people be at a different state,
and we'll talk about something.

01:00:40.055 --> 01:00:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, well,
yeah, all my notes here.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Forget that.
