00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Jim Self,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
we discussed what it means to
be living in a third-dimensional

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:84%
experience versus a
fourth-dimensional life.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:84%
We even forayed
into the experience

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth dimension.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:10%
In this conversation, we
delve into the mechanics

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.090 align:middle line:10%
of how to rewire our
frequencies, and thus

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.849 align:middle line:10%
our life's experience to a much
finer and more joyful level.

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
It's all about awareness
and consciousness.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But first, we have to become
familiar with where we've

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
been buying into other people's
realities and beliefs about us.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:90%
This is where awareness begins.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about that quite a
lot in the last show, actually.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend, if you
have not seen the last show,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:84%
take a look at that one
before we even begin this one.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a real continuation
of a conversation.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And where we left
off last time was

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:84%
about what happens when the
large structures of society

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle line:90%
start essentially falling away.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:84%
This could be a very
chaotic period of time.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:84%
But before we do that,
just a thumbnail sketch--

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
you didn't go to sleep like
most of us do when we're born.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
You stayed awake
your entire life.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:84%
As we leave at night
and go back to our home

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
place, that other
dimensional field and back,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:84%
you bring back all
your awareness.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
You know what it
looks like, feels

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
like, what the future
holds, because you never

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
lost your connection-- which
theoretically none of us

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
should have, but we all
have, for the most part.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> JIM SELF: Well, I'm not sure
about what the future holds,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:90%
because that's always in flux.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you
know what I mean.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.208 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: But yes.

00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:10%
So I come back
remembering where I was.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:10%
instead of just stepping into
the body as virtually everybody

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:10%
else does, and resume
the day before.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:10%
And so it's an absolutely
wonderful place

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:10%
to experience because it
provides an insight into choice

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.717 align:middle line:10%
in a little different manner
than what some of us--

00:02:03.717 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And some of what
will be made available to us

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:10%
for our choice, and what
is being made available

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.340 align:middle line:10%
to for our choice.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: And this
is-- I'm not unique.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not special.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm not better than.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I just simply have this
aspect of my awareness

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's part
of what I do to help

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.781 align:middle line:90%
move this whole process forward.

00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And also, you
were saying in our last

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:84%
conversation-- and I
alluded to it a moment ago--

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:90%
that this is within all of us.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
This is what we naturally
should be doing,

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.630 align:middle line:84%
had we not blocked ourselves
through the mechanism of buying

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:84%
into other people's
beliefs and ideas

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and this third-dimensional
structure.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to
explain very briefly,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
because we have so
much more to cover,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:84%
just the essence of
what it was like being

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.279 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, where
many of us still, by habit, go.

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Well, that
third dimension--

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
let's call it a box
to make it simple.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And each one of the dimensions
are a box for this purpose.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But a dimension is a
strata of consciousness

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that you choose aspects
and energetics from

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:84%
to then apply into
realms of your choice.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But the third-dimensional
box is very rigid.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It deals and holds words
like "always" and "never."

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:90%
It is conditional.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing unconditional
in the third-dimensional box.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
The time frame is treated
as absolute-- past, present,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:84%
future, then you die-- where, in
fact, it's not absolute at all.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
challenging box to play in,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:84%
because when it
was built, it was

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:84%
built for something
very specific.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The box itself
had great purpose.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But it does not have
flexibility, or fluidity,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:90%
or mobility within it.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
choice within it.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:84%
When you start to have
words like "unconditional"

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and "choice," you
begin to play in

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
a fourth-dimensional structure
or box, if you would.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
In that box you have time is
in present time, right now.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And in right now, instead of
having a reaction to something,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:84%
you have a choice to how you
would like to-- you can react.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:84%
But you have a choice to
do something different.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
There's also a
word called paradox

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimension, which
is very, very valuable word

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
because it means what
was true or false forever

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
until this moment may not be
true or false in this moment.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So it gives you choice, and
flexibility, and opportunity

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
understand time is present.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Choice is available.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And paradox gives
you opportunity.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then
the fifth dimension?

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Fifth dimension
is a place where,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.480 align:middle line:84%
if I was be simple, it's that
place where you have the great

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
dinner party with your six best
friends that you haven't seen

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
for numbers of
years, and you laugh.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:90%
You are in complete ease.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.660 align:middle line:84%
You're in gratitude,
appreciation, well-being,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:90%
co-creation, cooperation.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Those are the kind of the
words of the fifth dimension.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's done from an alignment
and a sense of presence that

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.994 align:middle line:84%
is just extraordinary as
you begin to get into it.

00:05:08.994 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's where
manifestation of your creation

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.174 align:middle line:84%
starts happening much more
rapidly, with much more--

00:05:15.174 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
with virtually no
resistance, actually, right?

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: In that space, as
you begin to wire the body,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:84%
you begin to bring the
mental emotional body

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:90%
into a singularity.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:90%
You find that there's no doubt.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Words like "doubt" and
"can't" don't exist.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You just simply
hold your attention

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and put your attention
on your intention,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.807 align:middle line:90%
and fully expect it to happen.

00:05:38.807 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is
also because, by this time,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:84%
you are listening to
the whisper of the soul.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to what the
heart desires, rather than what

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:84%
society, and the mind,
and its programming

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:90%
is telling you to do.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So you're already in
alignment with your choices.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.205 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Right, and
then that just--

00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're in
alignment with you.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.263 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Yeah.

00:05:53.263 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And that just begins to expand
because you are the soul.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're playing out a small
part of the soul's desire.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But as you begin to get
into this alignment,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
more and more of the
presence of the soul

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:90%
begins to be available.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:84%
More aspect of the creator
begin to be available.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Then the creative process begins
to be very, very fascinating.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very fast
and very beautiful.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, one thing we need to talk
about is-- that's all lovely.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we're headed.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:84%
However, we have
some stepping stones

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
all have to trod.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things it's going
to bring up in a lot of people

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:90%
is fear.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is because
the old structures--

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about the
most familiar structures--

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.500 align:middle line:84%
our education systems, our
monetary systems, churches,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:90%
all this.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
We're already beginning to see
the cracks and the crumbling

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.765 align:middle line:90%
in the systems and structures.

00:06:41.765 --> 00:06:42.879 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Very much.

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you said
in our last conversation,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:84%
over the next few months,
and even few years,

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see almost
a falling away, a collapse,

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that you say gives us
opportunity for transformation.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what that looks like,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and how quickly that
can occur, and then

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.145 align:middle line:84%
how quickly it can be brought
back to a new reality.

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: OK, let's just set the
framework for that a little bit

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:90%
here, too.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So when we talked
the last, I said

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:90%
the third dimension is gone.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean the third
dimension is falling away?

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:84%
The third dimension,
to a great extent,

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:84%
is that structure that I
just talked about, as opposed

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to the table, the
chair, the earth.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:90%
That's form.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:90%
The form's not going away.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions aren't
places that you go to.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
The third dimension has been
removed as of this 2012 period

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.600 align:middle line:84%
of time that we
just went through.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:84%
In simple terms,
we've stepped out

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.130 align:middle line:84%
of one vibrational frequency
into a higher, faster,

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.020 align:middle line:84%
less conditional
vibrational frequency.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, the
glue or the magnetics

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that held all of the
anger, and the rage,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and the embarrassment,
humiliation,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:84%
those kind of
words-- all of that

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:84%
baggage that I've been putting
back here because I don't want

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:90%
anybody to see that I'm not OK.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
What holds that
together no longer

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
is in your energetic field.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So what you're about to
see in these coming years

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
is everything that
created the illusion--

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.900 align:middle line:84%
domination and slavery, and
the repressions that we've all

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.862 align:middle line:84%
experienced, and
the conditionality

00:08:20.862 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:84%
of the game that's been played--
let's not even take it on.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's just accept that that
was all conditional structure.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:84%
That glue is no longer
in that structure.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So where people could dominate
with fear or intimidation--

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:84%
and they will still do that
out of habit, but the viability

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and the belief
system that allows

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
that to have the same
impact, in terms of the fear

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that somebody would just accept
and cower to, and go, OK.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll do what you say.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:90%
That's no longer in place.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we should be
expecting rebellion from

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's appropriate.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: From ourselves, because
all of that, where I've said,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not OK, and I've held
my own embarrassments,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the word is, all
of that no longer has to stay

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.190 align:middle line:90%
It's beginning to peel away.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And as it peels away, it
moves into your conscious,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:90%
a present time awareness.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:90%
You have a choice.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
You can choose to
say, oh, my god.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:90%
Why it this here again?

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And how come I'm still
such a bad person?

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:90%
That's a choice.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:84%
That's not a wise
choice, but that's

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:90%
a choice in this context.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.994 align:middle line:90%
Or you can simply say, wow.

00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that guy's name,
he said, if you just

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.920 align:middle line:84%
say it's leaving,
and let it leave,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:90%
you're going to find it leaves.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And much of the "who I'm not"
is now beginning to peel away.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.530 align:middle line:84%
The part that is all the
illusion that you've created,

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:84%
based on the external
reality that we've

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:84%
come to called third dimension,
but that's now changing.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so we
have these structures.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And this starts bringing
out fear in people.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest areas
of fear is around money

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.990 align:middle line:84%
because we have
been made to believe

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:90%
that money equals survival.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if we'll
have a roof over our head

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:90%
without money.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.694 align:middle line:84%
So up until now-- certainly
the last 100 years or so,

00:10:12.694 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and beyond that.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:84%
But for the average person,
even-- saving money,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:84%
rather than living off of
the land, season by season,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
day to day, for example,
became an imperative.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.785 align:middle line:84%
You must save money
so that you know

00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that you can survive
into your older years,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:84%
or that you can even
survive a few months if you

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
lose your job.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Now those structures are
going to be changing,

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
from what you're
saying, as well.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.201 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Very much.

00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And they should.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Really, hoarding,
on any level, is not

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:84%
part of the new
dimensional frequency.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: It's fear.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So fear and separation--
two huge words.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
into protectionism.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Then you get into mind.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:90%
And then you get into safety.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.040 align:middle line:84%
All that structure,
that was all within

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:90%
that third-dimensional box.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:90%
That's no longer necessary.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But what is still in
place is the habit

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:84%
that causes you to
go to that space.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
part that is going

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:90%
to be challenging is the habit.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the thing
is, the younger people,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.105 align:middle line:84%
the generation--
especially 30 and under--

00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
these people have a very
different way of relating.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:84%
They haven't had the benefits
of being able to kind of create

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:84%
their reality in the same
way previous generations did,

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't
had any money.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:90%
The money went away.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So they've learned to
be more cooperative,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
in some situations,
more communal.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Others have just
dropped out saying,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I can't even see
where to go, and are

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:84%
smoking weed all
day, or whatever,

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:84%
just to not deal with it--
totally understandable.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But they've inherited a
different reality already.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, I mean, it
can't be a matter

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
of waiting for our
generation and beyond to die.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Something is going to
transform quickly here.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Well, it could be that.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:90%
It won't happen.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody's going
to wait until we die.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:84%
But you're watching these
new kids, and in a way,

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
since the Harmonic
Convergence in '87,

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
you've been having the the
Indigo Kids, and the Rainbow

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Kids, and the this
kid, and the that kid.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And they're all correct.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:84%
There's all segmented stratas
of these new kids coming in.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
watch things happen.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.755 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
money in a minute.

00:12:16.755 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to watch,
for example, these kids--

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.831 align:middle line:84%
and they're already doing it
with things like Facebook,

00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:84%
the invention of Facebook,
the invention of social media.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.925 align:middle line:90%
That's by the kids.

00:12:24.925 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones who
are creating this.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, older people are
playing in the games,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:90%
too, and doing it.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to watch
the educational system

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:84%
of this country change
within the next 10 years.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, the older people,
the old white guys that

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
are thinking they need to
do from their old history,

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
they're not in sync
with what is going on.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
In this last election, you
could see it really clearly.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.824 align:middle line:84%
And just the relationship--
without being

00:12:50.824 --> 00:12:52.490 align:middle line:84%
political-- the
relationship between how

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
the Republicans kept saying
they were taking on all

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
these states, and how the
Obama people went and dealt

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
with the younger people,
the different communities,

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and basically spoke to them.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
these young kids recreate

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
the entire educational
system within the next five

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.001 align:middle line:90%
to ten years.

00:13:09.001 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Which is fabulous--

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Fabulous.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tearing
down and recreating.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: So, what
you're seeing, though,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of the fear is, is
you look at people older than

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.830 align:middle line:84%
30, for example, and that's
where a lot of your fear is.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the habit that
they've grown up in,

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:90%
in that third-dimensional box.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, with the glue taken
away, the magnetics taken away

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
from the third dimension,
things are not as in place

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
as they were prior to the third
dimension disappearing, which

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
makes it even more terrifying
for older people, especially

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
conservative older people,
who don't want change.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what conservative is.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I like this.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Keep it safe.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:84%
There are no bad
people, but for people

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:84%
who are unable to cope with
change, a number of things

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:90%
are happening.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
You're watching them
get more uncomfortable.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.014 align:middle line:84%
And you're also watching
many more leave their bodies.

00:14:00.014 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about
that at some point here.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, just the last
few weeks, I've seen alone.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: All over the world,
you're watching people,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:84%
at a very disproportionate
level, leave their body.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And in simple terms,
what they're saying is,

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:90%
I can't handle this.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And what they can't handle
is these new higher, faster

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:84%
frequencies of consciousness,
of knowledge, of wisdom,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:90%
of well-being.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
They're beginning to
form very rapidly.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like watching water
freeze, all of a sudden,

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:90%
and people going, what's that?

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people-- they
don't have to be older.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.237 align:middle line:84%
They're even younger
people that just simply, I

00:14:34.237 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to do with this.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
they're checking out--

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: They're checking out.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --finding
a way to check out.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I noticed this with my
father, for example.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:84%
He's now 82 years old, and an
amazingly open-minded person,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.959 align:middle line:84%
even though he is-- from
an external viewpoint,

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:50.375 align:middle line:84%
he'd be considered
a conservative,

00:14:50.375 --> 00:14:52.390 align:middle line:90%
in all senses of the word.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:84%
But he's been open
through the years.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
We've had conversations
about many of these things.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And he is just
standing there saying,

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what happened.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.300 align:middle line:84%
The whole system, it turns
out-- talking economically--

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.894 align:middle line:90%
the system was a lie.

00:15:06.894 --> 00:15:07.852 align:middle line:90%
All of this is corrupt.

00:15:07.852 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:90%
It was all fixed.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And it broke his heart to think
that the things he had believed

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:90%
in were all essentially a sham.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet, somehow, I
think he's still here

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.720 align:middle line:84%
because he's managed to
transcend that, and look

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.414 align:middle line:84%
for new ways to deal and contend
with life and monetary systems.

00:15:25.414 --> 00:15:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
aren't contending with it.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:84%
They're just
broken-hearted or angry.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Or they don't
have the capacity to look

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:33.882 align:middle line:90%
at the choices.

00:15:33.882 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The choices,
yes, new choices.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.217 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: But there are--
let's keep it really clear,

00:15:38.217 --> 00:15:40.050 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
people, like your father,

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:44.070 align:middle line:84%
that simply have always had this
internal guidance system that

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:90%
knew their own truth.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
But the system said
this is what you

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:90%
must do to fit into the box.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But when you talk
to 'em-- and I talk

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
to lots of different
people-- and you

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
get right to this point,
and you say, are you happy?

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.982 align:middle line:84%
They say, no, because I didn't
do what I really wanted to do.

00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, now that's
the big one at the end of life.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.856 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: And that's what they're
talking about right here,

00:16:06.856 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:84%
this "I didn't follow my own
internal guidance system.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I listened to the
external world."

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the
time for that's over.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Time for that is over.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.258 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're to
listen to our hearts.

00:16:15.258 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a complex,
diverse, beautiful society

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.145 align:middle line:84%
when everybody is expressing
their true desire.

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Right.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And the box that you-- if
you said that months ago,

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
the box would have
still controlled

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:84%
the glue, the magnetics, your
freedom, your flexibility,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:90%
your mobility.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
But that glue, that magnetic
hold of the third dimension

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.130 align:middle line:90%
has been removed.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And so now you've got
lots of freedom to choose.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.660 align:middle line:84%
You've got your
habits, and people

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:90%
are responding to the habits.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
That's where the transition
and the challenge is.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always
done it this way.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.952 align:middle line:90%
And they'll move out of that.

00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
take a good three

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
to five years for
that to happen.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.228 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and especially
since the structures,

00:16:54.228 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
themselves, have to dissipate,
and we have to create new ones.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not like something
magical is going to appear.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if it becomes
unstable enough,

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:84%
we have to start
learning about barter,

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:84%
or any number of
things, or even creating

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.534 align:middle line:84%
new kinds of less
usurious monetary systems.

00:17:10.534 --> 00:17:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just speaking of the
money, because so many people

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:90%
have fear around it right now.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Because after 2008, a lot
of their money went away.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.778 align:middle line:84%
But we are creating
something new.

00:17:18.778 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Well,
there's something new,

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and the something new
is going to transition--

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and it could transition
very smoothly,

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
if the fear doesn't keep
being the anchor point.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So if people don't keep
worrying about mine,

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to transition.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm expecting
it to transition

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.004 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit
of clumsiness in it.

00:17:38.004 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
I would think so.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.836 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: And all you have to
do it watch the current state

00:17:41.836 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
of the Democratic, Republicans--
again, not being political.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
You're watching two ideologies,
neither right or wrong,

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.255 align:middle line:84%
but you're watching something
that's really clashing.

00:17:54.255 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're listening
to supercharged words,

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:90%
like "fiscal cliff."

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.787 align:middle line:84%
Someone came up
with fiscal cliff.

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the new word for the day.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
It's distributed
among the media.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Within an hour, everybody's
talking about it.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
No one has any idea what
it is, but they're all

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:90%
talking about that fiscal cliff.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.375 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: That's
part of the fear.

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So the fiscal cliff
came and went.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.595 align:middle line:84%
And nothing significantly
got accomplished.

00:18:13.595 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of course.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: But we didn't die,
like we were supposed to.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
But the value of
that whole discussion

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.230 align:middle line:84%
was it amplified this sense
within the new energetics.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to see this begin

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.282 align:middle line:90%
to really unravel very rapidly.

00:18:27.282 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's
another thing I found,

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:84%
a story that I
found fascinating.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.270 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
an Italian friend,

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:84%
and he was telling me
about a candidate in Italy

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.790 align:middle line:84%
right now running
for president, who

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.660 align:middle line:84%
is 60 years of age, roughly,
former comedian, very, very

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
savvy in terms of the
issues and the politics.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And Italy is rife with,
well, lots of politicians,

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
and certainly a good
amount of corruption,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:90%
like everywhere else.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And he decided he was going
to run on a platform that

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.225 align:middle line:84%
would cost no money-- no
money to his campaign.

00:18:56.225 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:84%
It was all going to be
through social networking.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:90%
He is doing so well with this.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Beppe-- I can't remember his
last name-- Beppe someone.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
He's doing so well
with this right now

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that the current
administration has

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
changed the date
of the election.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and the young
people are flocking to him

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
because he's telling some truth.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And he refuses to
go on television

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.270 align:middle line:84%
because that's the old
way of doing things.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And even though he has
been invited, he's refused.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And now he's getting this
groundswell of support

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
so strong they're changing
the election from May,

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and pushing it up to next
month, or February, just

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
to sideline him and
take his momentum away.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I thought--- my heart just
becomes effervescent when I

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
hear these stories about
the beauty of how people are

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.984 align:middle line:84%
finding new ways
to do everything.

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, as you
mentioned earlier,

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
our political system will have
to go down a similar road.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: And even if he loses,
there will be a new one right

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:90%
behind him quickly.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And so this game is
evolving very rapidly.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that's
driving it right now

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
is this internal
guidance system.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
We talked in that last
session about this--

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:84%
but this internal guidance
alignment that each one of us

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:90%
have in our heart.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
You simply, when you know your
truth, you know your truth.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:90%
There's no discussion about it.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Now you can say,
oh, I don't know.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I should do that.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:90%
And there's always a feeling.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Which feeling feels better?

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
When you're aligned
with this, and you

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.690 align:middle line:84%
go against that
internal alignment,

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
you don't feel very
happy, and you get sick

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:90%
eventually from that.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening is, with
the restrictions being removed

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
in this third-dimensional
box, people

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:84%
are now beginning
to have more access

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:90%
to that internal guidance.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the draw, the magnetic
pull away from the heart,

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:90%
is no longer there.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.308 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what's this
doing to the physical body?

00:20:45.308 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
We've transitioned out of the
third-dimensional reality.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%
We're using the
fourth as a platform

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
to move into the
fifth-dimensional

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.220 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.331 align:middle line:84%
What is this doing in terms
of a DNA rewiring level

00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:90%
to the human body?

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: It's a sequential
stepped process.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So those that thought
on December 21,

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
they were going to be a
big puff of white light,

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.141 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to wind up
in white robes and beards,

00:21:09.141 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
it ain't going to
happen that way.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's a transitional process.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.301 align:middle line:84%
The piece that is most
important is the piece

00:21:15.301 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to talk
about right here, which

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
is what is the first
step, more or less.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And see, I can tell you
about the Christed Matrix.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you about
the 12-pointed Chakra

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:84%
system that's very
available right now.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you about accessing
the sanctuary within the Sacred

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:90%
Heart.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you about the
electromagnetic fields.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you about the
physical body turning to light.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But all that is is interesting
intellectual conversation

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it's here, and
you, me, we, are here.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And some assembly required--
there's a transition.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So the first aspect of this is
you cannot take your baggage

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:90%
with you on this journey.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is the
beginning of the tools.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.816 align:middle line:90%
And I just want to say this.

00:21:55.816 --> 00:21:58.599 align:middle line:84%
The book is written in such a
way-- it's really well done.

00:21:58.599 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Thank you.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very direct,
impactful, useful book.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:10%
It's called What Do You Mean the
Third Dimension is Going Away?

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:10%
And in this book, you have
not only-- it's lined out.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:10%
You set the foundation.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:10%
And then you have the tools,
sequentially, to get there.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:90%
But it's interactive.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
You can also go to
a website, and there

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
are complementary
meditations that

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
complement the various
areas of the book,

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:90%
and such, as well-- audio files.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is really a journey,
a real practice people

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:90%
can go into.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, let's
introduce the beginning.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
the foundation

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
in the last conversation
and this one.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
What is tool number one
again, about the baggage?

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Well, let's just
set the framework again.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So as I grow up, I'm told by
mom, dad, teacher, minister,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
in whatever context,
you don't fit in.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.657 align:middle line:90%
You're not OK.

00:22:50.657 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:90%
You're not doing it right.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:90%
You're not attractive.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:90%
You're not smart.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:90%
You're never going to succeed.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
We all collect our share
of those "you're not OK's."

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:84%
In absolute truth,
you cannot be not OK.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Impossible.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.455 align:middle line:84%
In real terms, you can't
even make a mistake.

00:23:05.455 --> 00:23:07.079 align:middle line:84%
Now right here, people
jump up, and go,

00:23:07.079 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:90%
oh, you haven't seen my life.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, I have, actually.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
You have explored,
and you have tried

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:90%
on different coats and hats.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And some fit, and
some didn't fit.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And some were kind of OK,
and others were not OK.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:90%
That's called experience.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:84%
You come here to
have experience.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:10%
You don't come here to be
right or wrong, or good or bad.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:10%
That's third dimension.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing to
really begin to understand

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:10%
is you can't do it wrong.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:10%
So where somebody said
you're not attractive,

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:10%
you're not smart, nobody's
ever going to hire you.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:10%
Or you have been embarrassed,
or whatever it may be.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:10%
And those things
happen to all of us.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.490 align:middle line:10%
High school girls is the worst
place to live life, I think,

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:10%
for anybody.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.462 align:middle line:84%
Because there's all this
figuring it out in--

00:23:52.462 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Fear of rejection.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Oh, all
kinds of things--

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and I wear the wrong
clothes, and I'm embarrassed,

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:90%
and everybody laughs at me.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.818 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
you think about your life

00:23:59.818 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:84%
is those little
instances where you

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:84%
said something and everybody
laughed at you took one second

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and your life went to
a different direction.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And so you take that, and
you go, oh, I'm not OK.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So somebody hands you a gift,
not one that you really want.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:90%
But you say, OK.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:90%
I guess I'm not OK.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you try
to deal with it.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.883 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know
what to do with it,

00:24:24.883 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:90%
so eventually you deny it.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And you stuff it back
here in your backpack,

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and you put it in
unconsciousness.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:90%
But at the same time it's there.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:84%
See, all thoughts-- thoughts
don't just go poof into the air

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.250 align:middle line:84%
when you get done
thinking a thought.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:90%
All thoughts go somewhere.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And thoughts are electrical.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.920 align:middle line:90%
And emotions are magnetic.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So when you take a thought
that says, I'm not OK,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.171 align:middle line:84%
and then you drop into
your emotional body,

00:24:53.171 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
it's like, oh, god,
this isn't good at all.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not OK.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not OK.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking a wire and
creating this huge magnetic

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.110 align:middle line:90%
frequency-- electromagnetic--

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.526 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And in
third dimension,

00:25:02.526 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
thoughts are every bit as
real and material as this

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:90%
dimensional form is to us.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: In this dimension,
even in third dimension,

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:84%
thoughts are what
create the reality.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
this part of it

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
at length in our
first interview.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.767 align:middle line:84%
So again, I would encourage
you to go back and watch

00:25:20.767 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:90%
the first interview.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:84%
We go into a lot
of this in detail.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So tool number one is we
can't take that stuff with us.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.186 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: No you can't.

00:25:27.186 --> 00:25:30.069 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand that,
one of the things that happens--

00:25:30.069 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and really the first
place you want to be--

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is become aware of being
aware-- or at least becoming

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:90%
conscious of being conscious.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.960 align:middle line:84%
In the third dimension, most
people walk around unconscious

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.520 align:middle line:90%
of being unconscious.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So to become aware,
fourth dimension,

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.400 align:middle line:84%
step into present time,
the first piece of that.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.560 align:middle line:84%
But to do it, there's
a place called

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.410 align:middle line:84%
the center of your head--
sounds very, like, oh, yeah,

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.500 align:middle line:84%
of course-- but when you pull
your attention into the center

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:84%
of your head-- kind of
just pull your awareness

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:84%
into a tightness right
behind your eyes--

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and then look through
your eyes and observe

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.740 align:middle line:84%
the room, without
going to the wall,

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.016 align:middle line:84%
just kind of observe the
wall, and continue to breathe,

00:26:12.016 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
because people will stop
reading right there,

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:84%
you start to create
a place where

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:20.260 align:middle line:84%
you can observe from that
allows you to be in present time

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.207 align:middle line:90%
and choose.

00:26:21.207 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're going to
take a break in a minute here,

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.910 align:middle line:84%
but this would have to be
involving the master glands

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:90%
on some level, right?

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.581 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Well, it does, but
basically it's even more

00:26:30.581 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:90%
simple.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.246 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: More fundamental.

00:26:32.246 --> 00:26:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: It's just you being
aware of you being aware.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.746 align:middle line:84%
Once you begin to operate
from this awareness,

00:26:37.746 --> 00:26:38.620 align:middle line:90%
then you have choice.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, because
even just talking about it,

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:84%
feeling that place in the
center of the head really shifts

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.332 align:middle line:90%
the way your perceptions work.

00:26:47.332 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Exactly.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's very different
than just looking out eyes

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.422 align:middle line:90%
unconsciously.

00:26:51.422 --> 00:26:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Exactly.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.715 align:middle line:90%
See, then you have choice.

00:26:53.715 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's were you begin to
take responsibility and create

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.854 align:middle line:90%
your life, driven by the heart.

00:26:59.854 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And again, all of
this is detailed in the book,

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.100 align:middle line:84%
so we only have so much
time to talk about it.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.870 align:middle line:10%
The next one is called
the gift of grounding.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.681 align:middle line:10%
Now, grounding has been
used and misused a lot.

00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:10%
What are you talking
about with grounding?

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:10%
>> SELF: So everybody thinks
they know what grounding is.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.926 align:middle line:84%
Grounding is simply-- your
toasters are grounded.

00:27:17.926 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Your blenders are grounded.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of that is to siphon
off the excess electricity that

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:90%
runs through the body.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But we've already said
thoughts are electrical.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.504 align:middle line:84%
So how many times have you had
a thought that got in your head,

00:27:30.504 --> 00:27:31.962 align:middle line:84%
and you just kept
thinking it all--

00:27:31.962 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, the loop.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: --day long.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is, when you ground

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.550 align:middle line:84%
from the tip of the spine,
lower end of the spine--

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.590 align:middle line:84%
if you just think this
imaging up in your mind,

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.775 align:middle line:90%
it's already there.

00:27:41.775 --> 00:27:43.130 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It just did not
necessarily be turned on.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you just
think about a line,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.900 align:middle line:84%
creating a mental image
picture of a chain, a pipe,

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
or just a line, and hooking it
literally in your imagination,

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:90%
taking your thought.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
If you had an imaginary
third hand, take the line,

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:84%
connect it right to the first
chakra, tip of the spine.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.915 align:middle line:84%
Drop the other end into
the center of the planet.

00:28:06.915 --> 00:28:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Now everybody will tell
you, oh, I know about that.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is, when you do

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that, you create
this connection.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing
is, you literally

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:90%
have to tell it to turn on.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to
do is say, turn on--

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:84%
but from the center
of your head,

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:90%
not just a whimsical thought.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you create
that electrical line,

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and then take a breath,
sit into it, kind of just

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.770 align:middle line:84%
feel being pulled into the
chair with the grounding,

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
those random
thoughts begin to now

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.820 align:middle line:84%
have a place to go, just
like the electricity

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:84%
in the grounding
cord of your toaster.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But the piece that people don't
talk about-- and for 30 years

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I taught grounding,
exactly what I just said.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.145 align:middle line:84%
But when I really got to
start pay attention to it

00:28:48.145 --> 00:28:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and recognized this aspect
that emotions are magnetic--

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.030 align:middle line:84%
they're every much as
present as those thoughts.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So I say, you're not
attractive, and you go, oh,

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean by that?

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's an emotion that
gets-- But what I think of you

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.632 align:middle line:90%
is none of your business.

00:29:03.632 --> 00:29:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Your business is all
about your business.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:90%
So what I--

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a choice.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.861 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: And so you
begin to have a choice.

00:29:07.861 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But in the grounding cord,
there is a second component.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.136 align:middle line:90%
And it's a coil.

00:29:13.136 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:10%
And it looks more or
less like this one

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:10%
we're putting on the screen.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:10%
But it just simply wraps
around the electrical line.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.490 align:middle line:10%
And it siphons off all that
excess magnetic charge.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So, in other words,
emotions that are overcharged

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:84%
or over-amped or
inappropriately placed.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:29.558 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Exactly.

00:29:29.558 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you can take the "oh
no, I'm embarrassed" out of it

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning,
then the winding up

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
that magnetic
field-- I'm not OK.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm not OK.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm OK-- has no structure
to really get started.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And so you basically take
the thought and the emotion.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:90%
And so I do something.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:90%
I embarrass myself.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Everybody laughs at me.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I can choose at that moment
to be petrified or mortified

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.310 align:middle line:90%
by it.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Or I can go, yeah, that was
really pretty funny, wasn't it?

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And get about my life.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And so with the tools in
place, and with you turned on,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.130 align:middle line:84%
you begin to have some
choices that you don't have--

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it sounds like,
because you had this visual

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:84%
imagery for them, it's as though
you are helping create a new

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:84%
visual structure of
fourth-dimensional frequencies

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that dissolves away the
unconscious structures that

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.330 align:middle line:90%
existed in the third.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Exactly.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So what we're beginning to do
here is give you a platform,

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.920 align:middle line:84%
give you some structure to
use the fourth dimension

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.990 align:middle line:84%
as a stepping stone into
the fifth dimension.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a place that you
don't have to linger.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:84%
There's much more interesting
things in the fifth dimension.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But you can't get to the
fifth without recognizing

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:90%
present time and choice.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: After
that is the rose.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Now this, again,
this is something

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that has a deep kind
of visceral memory

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.802 align:middle line:90%
within our bodies on some level.

00:30:48.802 --> 00:30:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: It does.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it has been
used in spiritual and esoteric

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.145 align:middle line:90%
circles throughout history.

00:30:53.145 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: It has.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.565 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why?

00:30:54.565 --> 00:30:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Why the rose, and then
tell us how you utilize it.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Well, historically it
comes out of the feminine side

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
of the church, the
Magdalene energy.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And it goes right
through that rose line,

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and it moves right through
a particular aspect.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Interesting thing-- if you
take a rose, physical rose,

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.810 align:middle line:84%
if you look at herbs,
they all have frequencies.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Every living thing in the
planet has frequencies.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Physical herbs have a
frequency of kind of 0 to 50,

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and emotional herbs, et cetera,
Frankincense, Sandalwood--

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:90%
200, 205 hertz.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.240 align:middle line:90%
There's a vibration of them.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.030 align:middle line:90%
So there's your spiritual range.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sandalwood, OK.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Frankincense
as a spiritual tool.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:84%
When you get to
Bulgarian rose oil,

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:84%
it vibrates at 800, not
even close to the organic--

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.785 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, I always
knew it was a much finer,

00:31:42.785 --> 00:31:43.576 align:middle line:90%
higher frequencies.

00:31:43.576 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:90%
It has amazing properties.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:45.846 align:middle line:90%
But that's huge.

00:31:45.846 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Yeah, that's huge.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:90%
So how is that possible?

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, without trying to
figure that piece out,

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.361 align:middle line:90%
a rose has an impact.

00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
that becomes very interesting

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:57.760 align:middle line:84%
about this rose, one
choice use of the rose,

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.010 align:middle line:84%
is when you use this concept of
the rose, mental image picture.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So if I said to you, can you
create an image of a rose

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.140 align:middle line:84%
right out here, and so, if you
don't think you're clairvoyant,

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:84%
can you remember what
a rose looks like?

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.559 align:middle line:90%
Just remember it.

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting
thing about a rose

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:84%
is, when you put it
into an energetic field,

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.270 align:middle line:84%
it's templated makeup
will allow its--

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:84%
it's a higher, faster frequency
that will override a slower,

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:90%
duller frequency.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:84%
It's remarkable, watching
this for 30 years.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.060 align:middle line:90%
So I don't feel OK.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.560 align:middle line:90%
I am upset about something.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Or I really would like to get
something out of my reality.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:41.810 align:middle line:84%
If you create a rose, and you
simply say to the thought,

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.970 align:middle line:84%
have the rose collect up the
thought-- the "I'm not OK"

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:90%
thought.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And then just simply,
in your mind, watch it,

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.745 align:middle line:84%
and then explode the rose,
just like a fireworks

00:32:51.745 --> 00:32:54.110 align:middle line:90%
would be exploded.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Play with it just a
little bit, and you're

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.099 align:middle line:84%
going to find the ability to
clear patterns and thoughts--

00:33:00.099 --> 00:33:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I can feel it.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: --right out of your
space very, very rapidly.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
core pieces of how

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.280 align:middle line:84%
do you transform a
focal point by creating

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.945 align:middle line:90%
a physical construct--

00:33:12.945 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of a
higher frequency.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: --of a higher
frequency thought.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
that makes sense.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I had this book
of beautiful coffee table

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:84%
book of roses of every kind, and
that's how I started the day.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And I did it only because it
just made me feel so good.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.400 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.779 align:middle line:84%
It would start the day with
a very high range of feelings

00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts, though I wasn't
doing it for that reason.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I was doing it
because I liked it.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Sure.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So we know this.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: But why
did you like it?

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.751 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:39.418 align:middle line:90%
So we know this.

00:33:39.418 --> 00:33:40.126 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Exactly.

00:33:40.126 --> 00:33:40.920 align:middle line:90%
It's internal.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's very much part of this
internal guidance system

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:44.160 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:84%
So here, let me give you
another use for the rose, which

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.260 align:middle line:90%
becomes really invaluable.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.310 align:middle line:84%
When you're playing in
past, present, future,

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're not playing in
the center of your head,

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and you know this, how
many times in your life

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.930 align:middle line:84%
have you been affected by other
people's thoughts and emotions?

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So if I said to
you, where do you

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.930 align:middle line:90%
start and stop in this life?

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's an irrelevant
question in real terms,

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.239 align:middle line:90%
and it's inaccurate.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:13.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's a place
that we call the aura.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.659 align:middle line:84%
And so that aura on you
starts and stops right here.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, when you
don't pay attention to that,

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and I say, oh, I don't like
you because-- my thought passes

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.540 align:middle line:84%
right into your
field, vice versa.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.050 align:middle line:84%
But when you take this
rose, and you play with it

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.760 align:middle line:84%
in relationship
as a tool, and you

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.120 align:middle line:84%
define the edge of your aura--
and that's pretty simple.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Just take your hand straight
out, turn your palm this way,

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:84%
and plus or minus is
where a person's aura is.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.650 align:middle line:84%
If you take this
rose, and you put it

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:84%
right on the edge of the aura,
and bring your attention,

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:48.739 align:middle line:84%
all of your energy to this
side, and look through the rose,

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and you basically decide that,
from here, the rose, to here,

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.545 align:middle line:84%
is me, and everything on
the other side of the rose

00:34:56.545 --> 00:35:00.020 align:middle line:84%
is Shakespeare's
theater to entertain me,

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.540 align:middle line:84%
can you see what that
concept does just by itself?

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.400 align:middle line:90%
This is me.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's there
to entertain me,

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:84%
to understand how I
move through that life.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.780 align:middle line:84%
If you can hold this here,
and stay on your side,

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and view the world
through this rose,

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.500 align:middle line:84%
you will be absolutely
astonished at how

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:90%
you begin to manage yourself.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.730 align:middle line:84%
See, from here to here is all
I'm really responsible for.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Everything out there
is how I choose

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:28.379 align:middle line:84%
to move around within
my responsibility.

00:35:28.379 --> 00:35:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What you just
mentioned is a really big part

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.560 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:84%
The word "selfish" has
certainly been demonized.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It has very negative
connotation in the way

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.810 align:middle line:84%
it's used with us as children,
and throughout our lives,

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:90%
and accusations of each other.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
the time to become

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.620 align:middle line:84%
self-motivated,
self-aware self-ish

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.040 align:middle line:84%
is actually what
is going to take us

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:90%
into the higher frequencies.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: You cannot
go there being not OK.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:58.180 align:middle line:90%
And so think of it this way.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a stick called selfish.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.160 align:middle line:84%
On one end, there's
a aspect of it--

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.880 align:middle line:84%
third dimension-- where I step
on you, and I try to get ahead,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and I make you
not OK, so I'm OK.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Nobody likes that aspect of
selfish, appropriately so.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But the other end doesn't get
dealt with very often in most

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.250 align:middle line:84%
of our realities in
the third dimension,

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.960 align:middle line:84%
that end of the selfish
that says simply,

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.034 align:middle line:84%
if we were to start
out equal-- and this

00:36:22.034 --> 00:36:23.700 align:middle line:84%
is a concept a lot
of people have-- it's

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.510 align:middle line:90%
better to give than to receive.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.410 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard that
concept in the Bible.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, give to receive.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it, and
your first action is giving,

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.845 align:middle line:84%
and your second
action is giving--

00:36:33.845 --> 00:36:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're depleted.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: You become depleted.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you can be selfish,
not from using or damaging

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.750 align:middle line:84%
anybody, but beginning
to give to yourself,

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to have for yourself, you start
to find that you are happy.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move into those
happier, more enjoyable places,

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.940 align:middle line:84%
whether it's money, or
well-being, or relationship.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
give from that space.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.340 align:middle line:90%
You're never depleting yourself.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You begin to be in service to,
in a very, very healthy way.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:08.566 align:middle line:84%
This is the transition into
this fifth-dimensional space.

00:37:08.566 --> 00:37:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And going back to the
rose for just a moment,

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.130 align:middle line:84%
as I was reading in the
book, another aspect

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:84%
that we forget
about is, we don't

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.160 align:middle line:84%
want to take on
other people's stuff.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Right

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.895 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But on
the other hand,

00:37:18.895 --> 00:37:22.165 align:middle line:84%
we need to give back energy
we've taken on board.

00:37:22.165 --> 00:37:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And maybe talk about
that for a moment.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times
people forget that part,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.610 align:middle line:84%
which is give it back
to the other person.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Two techniques
with this rose--

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.090 align:middle line:84%
the rose has
multiple techniques.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Basically create a rose,
and then just simply

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:40.534 align:middle line:84%
say-- ask the question,
who got in my space today?

00:37:40.534 --> 00:37:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Actually, let me even
start better ways.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Start with you first.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Where did I leave myself?

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find
you left yourself

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.970 align:middle line:84%
looking at a can of peas
in the grocery store,

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:53.130 align:middle line:84%
looking at a stop sign,
having an argument,

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.236 align:middle line:90%
having a discussion.

00:37:54.236 --> 00:37:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Soon as you say, look
back at your day,

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.300 align:middle line:90%
where did you leave yourself?

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.650 align:middle line:90%
You'll see multiple things.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:04.060 align:middle line:84%
You have literally left your
energy and your attention

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:04.800 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.306 align:middle line:90%
Have the rose collect you up.

00:38:07.306 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't think about it.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Just say, collect me up.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And notice at the
beginning of that exercise,

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.602 align:middle line:84%
as you do it over
days period of time,

00:38:14.602 --> 00:38:16.060 align:middle line:84%
you start literally
[DEEP BREATH]--

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Feel more energy.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: --feeling better.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.090 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is, you're not
beating people up with this.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.020 align:middle line:84%
You just simply
create a second rose.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Who got in my space today?

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.800 align:middle line:90%
And you'll have a thought.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It could be your child,
your husband, your mother,

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:90%
your father-- no bad people.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love you so much.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And people love me so much,
but they love me all over me.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you, but I
don't need your energy,

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.690 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a wonderful
energy, in my space.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So finding balance-- if
you can give them back,

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.874 align:middle line:84%
put them in a rose, blow
up the rose, send it back.

00:38:48.874 --> 00:38:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Everything goes back
to them in neutral.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Even if you just had
a terrible argument,

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:84%
you give them back
them, and there's

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:56.470 align:middle line:90%
no "screw you" attached to it.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:90%
It just goes back.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you're whole again.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this begins to be very,
very useful set of tools.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:06.153 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I really like
the part on the rose because it

00:39:06.153 --> 00:39:09.672 align:middle line:84%
is so poignant, pungent-- no pun
intended-- in many, many ways.

00:39:09.672 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: It gives you choice.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It gives you choice
to manage your life

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.630 align:middle line:84%
very simply, very clearly,
and very effectively, quickly.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.125 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and all this
is about is transcending lower

00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:22.130 align:middle line:84%
third-dimension frequencies,
moving through so that we can

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:23.280 align:middle line:90%
really enjoy the fifth.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So I just want--
just punctuating it.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.799 align:middle line:84%
This is all about simple,
dimensional frequencies

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:28.840 align:middle line:90%
when it comes down to it.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: And let me say this,
because these are simple.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.834 align:middle line:90%
And people will say, oh--

00:39:32.834 --> 00:39:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've
heard that before.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: I've heard that or,
yeah, I know all about that.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But have you
successfully done it?

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.849 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: This will take you into
another aspect of your reality

00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:84%
if you begin to manage
yourself with these tools.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:44.806 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:44.806 --> 00:39:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about tool
number four, the higher mind.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.096 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Yeah.

00:39:48.096 --> 00:39:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The higher mind is a
very interesting place

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:53.862 align:middle line:84%
because, in the book, I kind of
describe a very simple thing.

00:39:53.862 --> 00:39:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Just get in the
center of your head

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and kind of go up and
back a little bit.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.122 align:middle line:90%
And it's an exercise.

00:39:58.122 --> 00:39:59.955 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
about the book is it's

00:39:59.955 --> 00:40:01.790 align:middle line:84%
got those codes in
it, where if you just

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.630 align:middle line:84%
simply scan your
phone on the code--

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
like a bar code.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:05.245 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Right.

00:40:05.245 --> 00:40:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It'll take you right to
the whole instruction.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.994 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are verbal,
half-hour meditations

00:40:10.994 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:84%
or particular
verbal instructions.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.535 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, very cool.

00:40:13.535 --> 00:40:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: But in that
particular case,

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:21.110 align:middle line:84%
the higher mind is a place-- you
know how you start to meditate

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.090 align:middle line:84%
sometime, and it takes you
20 minutes to get to a place

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.780 align:middle line:84%
to meditate, because you've got
all the noise that's running

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.394 align:middle line:90%
in your head.

00:40:27.394 --> 00:40:29.060 align:middle line:84%
When you get in the
center of your head,

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:84%
you begin to be aware of
that noise a lot of times.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.680 align:middle line:84%
See, it's not that the noise
isn't there or just showed up

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.730 align:middle line:90%
for your meditation.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.550 align:middle line:90%
It's you haven't been there.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.820 align:middle line:90%
You've been gone all day.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you come back to
get quiet, there's the noise.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.370 align:middle line:84%
But in the higher mind,
there's a little bit

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:46.370 align:middle line:90%
of work with the breath.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Very simple, just breathing.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you begin to raise
your attention point up--

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's all described in
the book pretty clearly,

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.610 align:middle line:84%
easier than trying
to do it all here.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.900 align:middle line:84%
You'll bring yourself
to a place where

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.290 align:middle line:90%
there's a focus, a clarity.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You have a curiosity,
but no question is asked.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if you step into
a giant cathedral in Europe,

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.352 align:middle line:84%
and you're the only one in the
building, and it's like, whoa.

00:41:12.352 --> 00:41:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's not some
religious thing.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.950 align:middle line:90%
It's just this like, wow.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:16.600 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're in your
own temple of yourself.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Exactly.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:24.096 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In truth of the
higher mind, an aspect of soul.

00:41:24.096 --> 00:41:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: And then there'll be a
point where you will merge that

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.370 align:middle line:84%
with the heart, and then things
begin to change dramatically.

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's where the
messages start having real

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.246 align:middle line:90%
purity and clarity.

00:41:33.246 --> 00:41:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you're no longer

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.870 align:middle line:90%
listening to outside messages.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Right.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.430 align:middle line:90%
And you have choice.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:38.638 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're dissolved.

00:41:38.638 --> 00:41:39.480 align:middle line:90%
And you have choice.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Very beautiful.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting into
geometry, because again,

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.270 align:middle line:84%
when you get into higher
dimensions and frequencies,

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.750 align:middle line:84%
you can't ignore
the fact that this

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.610 align:middle line:84%
is a geometrical
matrix we're living in.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.984 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
octahedron and what it does.

00:41:51.984 --> 00:41:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Well, the octahedron
is a very interesting thing.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So we played through the rose,
or talked about the rose.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Once upon a time, when
you were very healthy,

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.330 align:middle line:84%
the aura was
contained in a field.

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:08.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very stable field.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, the aura is being
bombarded all the time

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.980 align:middle line:84%
by everybody else's
emotions and thoughts.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
You're the effect of
people thinking in Italy

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.670 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the world.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:21.490 align:middle line:84%
There's no cohesiveness
to the aura.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The rose begins to give you a
sense of defining this space.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But building the octahedron--
we talk about it in the book

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:33.230 align:middle line:84%
very clearly-- is
something where

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.049 align:middle line:84%
you put the first
rose right out here.

00:42:36.049 --> 00:42:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And there's a line.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.390 align:middle line:84%
You draw a line from
here to the rose.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.580 align:middle line:84%
You draw a line same
distance behind you.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Or better yet, if you were
to rotate in a circle,

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.130 align:middle line:84%
you would create this
circumference around you.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:51.000 align:middle line:84%
At all four points
on the circle,

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.106 align:middle line:84%
there are points-- a
point below your feet,

00:42:53.106 --> 00:42:55.270 align:middle line:90%
and a point above your head.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:43:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you draw the lines to
connect it, you don't think it.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And the book tells you real
clearly, draw the lines.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Take your hand--

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as we're seeing,
it's really two four-sided

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.446 align:middle line:84%
pyramids stuck together,
glued together.

00:43:08.446 --> 00:43:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Right.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And stay out of
all the, well, that

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.220 align:middle line:90%
must mean-- keep it simple.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the most challenging
parts of all this

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.640 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people
that are listening

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.050 align:middle line:90%
is they're very good thinkers.

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And thinking is almost
your worst enemy

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:26.510 align:middle line:84%
here because the
rational mind is

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:28.820 align:middle line:84%
structured for the
third dimension.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.560 align:middle line:84%
It is not a
higher-dimensional mind.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Very important point.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: So the octahedron
allows you to create this

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.480 align:middle line:90%
containment field.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not a protection.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:38.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not a wall.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:39.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not a keep out.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It begins to be an antenna
that aligns into these higher,

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.030 align:middle line:84%
faster frequencies, just
like the old antennas that

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:51.405 align:middle line:84%
were put on the house to get the
new television when you were--

00:43:51.405 --> 00:43:53.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm dating myself a lot there.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But now the antenna
is a little clicker

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.969 align:middle line:84%
that's in your hand that
changes the channel.

00:43:57.969 --> 00:43:59.510 align:middle line:84%
But putting this
octahedron together,

00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.910 align:middle line:90%
it begins to do something.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why is
it the octahedron?

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I know that in some
other schools of thought

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.145 align:middle line:84%
through the '90s and
2000s, it was more

00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:09.250 align:middle line:84%
a star tetrahedron,
for example, which

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:84%
is inner penetrating
tetrahedron, which

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:22.100 align:middle line:84%
is a three-sided little pyramid
inner penetrating the other.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.270 align:middle line:84%
That was what people were
using for a long time.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:25.589 align:middle line:90%
Why now the octahedron?

00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:27.130 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between the two

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.730 align:middle line:84%
in its effect on the field
moving into higher dimensions?

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: The octahedron is the
core of the star tetrahedron.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.610 align:middle line:84%
See, all of these
geometries stack.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
build this one, you

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:42.020 align:middle line:84%
begin to create one set
of antennas, awareness.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.750 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to find
the center of your head,

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.320 align:middle line:84%
you begin to do
something else, which

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.430 align:middle line:84%
we won't talk about
here as a tool,

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:53.690 align:middle line:84%
but when you can begin to learn
to observe without going to.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.630 align:middle line:84%
If you watch people,
it's like, oh, yeah, hi.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You throw all your
energy and project yourself

00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:58.055 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:44:58.055 --> 00:44:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: It's when you can stay
in the center of your head,

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.475 align:middle line:84%
and observe what's going around,
then you begin to be aware

00:45:02.475 --> 00:45:04.567 align:middle line:90%
of 360 degrees around you.

00:45:04.567 --> 00:45:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and that's
where the mastery starts.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Exactly.

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And the octahedron allows you
to begin to hold this structure.

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:13.389 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:45:13.389 --> 00:45:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.297 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Good question.

00:45:15.297 --> 00:45:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.244 align:middle line:84%
The next one is activating
your own personal power field.

00:45:19.244 --> 00:45:20.910 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
about a power field,

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:23.650 align:middle line:84%
are you talking about
the aura, essentially?

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: No.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:90%
There's an energetic structure.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.630 align:middle line:90%
There's a column.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:31.500 align:middle line:84%
There's an alignment that
runs from this point above you

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.560 align:middle line:90%
at the octahedron.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a beautiful
illustration of this.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.836 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: So as you
begin to pull this--

00:45:37.836 --> 00:45:39.710 align:middle line:84%
there's a column runs
right through the core.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.290 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to
run these energies

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.100 align:middle line:84%
through that
personal power field,

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.335 align:middle line:84%
you start to raise your own
energetic frequencies up.

00:45:46.335 --> 00:45:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think that whole
description that we're

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:51.210 align:middle line:84%
looking at gives you the
flow of the whole process.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
that's beautiful.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:56.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, what about the living word?

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to
take responsibility

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.810 align:middle line:84%
for what comes
out of our mouths.

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:00.880 align:middle line:90%
That's difficult.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the very programs of
the third dimension that we've

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.120 align:middle line:84%
been living on up to this
moment are constructed

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:11.210 align:middle line:84%
of words, and words that were
very inappropriately used,

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:12.050 align:middle line:90%
damaging.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: There's an aspect that
I also talk about in the book--

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.180 align:middle line:90%
to set this up.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.410 align:middle line:84%
You actually think
in different layers.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And an average person
walking on the street,

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.550 align:middle line:84%
they just open mouth,
blurt out things.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.449 align:middle line:84%
And we both know
people that simply

00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:29.490 align:middle line:90%
talk, and talk, and talk.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you interrupt them,
and then you say to them,

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:33.300 align:middle line:90%
oh, sorry to interrupt you.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.174 align:middle line:90%
What were you saying?

00:46:34.174 --> 00:46:36.164 align:middle line:90%
They go, um, I don't remember.

00:46:36.164 --> 00:46:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And they don't remember
what they were saying.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.510 align:middle line:90%
It's just babble.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So as you begin to play
in these different tools,

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and you start to look at these
different layers of thought,

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.740 align:middle line:84%
there's a way of becoming
very quiet, very managed.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Every layer of quietness
you get, you draw yourself

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.120 align:middle line:90%
into an alignment.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.900 align:middle line:84%
It's in that space
that you begin

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.730 align:middle line:84%
to build these platforms
of living words.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So a word like-- people
go to "love" and "peace"--

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.880 align:middle line:90%
very valuable words.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But you're trying to
transition from here to there.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:10%
And so if you could
construct your life,

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.720 align:middle line:10%
and you could understand
the feeling of a word

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:18.790 align:middle line:10%
like "certainty" or "capable"
or "gracious" or "happy" or

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:22.920 align:middle line:10%
"commanding"-- and we have a
whole set of exercises in there

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.160 align:middle line:10%
that are audio that
simply walk you

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.610 align:middle line:10%
through how to feel
these different words,

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:30.470 align:middle line:10%
and then how to begin to
put them into geometries,

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:33.572 align:middle line:10%
and then how to make
them living experiences.

00:47:33.572 --> 00:47:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
quite a wonderful--

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very powerful--
but that also means the choice

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:42.290 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate the previous
set of words we've been using

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.527 align:middle line:84%
throughout our third-dimensional
reality experience.

00:47:44.527 --> 00:47:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Great point here.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.650 align:middle line:10%
So what happens, though,
there's another piece

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.970 align:middle line:10%
in the level-one work of
mastering alchemy, where

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:53.070 align:middle line:10%
we take a lot of this and
expand it considerably.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.310 align:middle line:10%
But the ability to
raise your energy field

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.370 align:middle line:10%
to 90% of the speed
of light-- people

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:58.800 align:middle line:10%
go, oh, that's really a lot.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.510 align:middle line:90%
No it isn't.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:02.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not a lot at all,
and it's not hard to do.

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But when you basically
raise your energy field up,

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
play in these tools,

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:11.510 align:middle line:84%
you simply step out of your
third-dimensional reality.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:15.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if I have to
fix myself and heal myself,

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and, like we've been
doing for 40 years,

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.280 align:middle line:84%
going to the therapist
to get over emotion body.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.310 align:middle line:84%
You simply hold these
higher, faster vibrations.

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And everything now in that
third dimension is dissolving.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:28.850 align:middle line:90%
It's just simply falling away.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:30.429 align:middle line:90%
Minimum work is required.

00:48:30.429 --> 00:48:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's good to know.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.845 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: But some
assembly is necessary.

00:48:33.845 --> 00:48:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some
assembly still required.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:37.331 align:middle line:84%
OK, this brings us
to the next one,

00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:38.830 align:middle line:84%
which is an obvious
follow-up, which

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:42.980 align:middle line:84%
is the strength of silence,
which our cultures are not

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.270 align:middle line:90%
particularly comfortable with.

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: No.

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is not-- I mean, you
see it in Buddhist practices.

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You see it in lots
of other practices

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.370 align:middle line:84%
where people have
participated over years.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But that 6 and 1/2 billion
people out there on the street,

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.920 align:middle line:90%
they don't know what silence is.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So to a great extent is,
rather than trying to find it,

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:05.100 align:middle line:84%
is-- we talk in the book-- about
these seven layers of thought

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and explain what it is
and then go play here.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.115 align:middle line:90%
And then step into the next one.

00:49:10.115 --> 00:49:11.240 align:middle line:90%
And step into the next one.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's two or
audios that I walk you through

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:17.280 align:middle line:90%
to begin to understand this.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But as you get quiet in
your space, this silence,

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:25.250 align:middle line:84%
this quietness becomes
very, very valuable.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It's an existence that
is fully conscious,

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:31.120 align:middle line:90%
and you choose from that.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's not some deep, sit
in a cave for 20 years, find

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:35.850 align:middle line:90%
silence.

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yet it
is very seductive.

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: It is a
wonderful thing.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.577 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
to experience that,

00:49:41.577 --> 00:49:44.160 align:middle line:84%
which allows you to then access
all the other aspects of self.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.075 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Yes.

00:49:45.075 --> 00:49:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But this silence, when you
start to have this managed,

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and you can command your
silence fully consciously,

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and you take that into a
fifth-dimensional space, words

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.610 align:middle line:84%
like "ease," and third-dimension
people use the word, well,

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:00.610 align:middle line:90%
take it easy.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:01.410 align:middle line:90%
And you go, OK.

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:02.756 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't mean anything.

00:50:02.756 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you get in
a meditative space,

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and you find ease,
as an example,

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.080 align:middle line:90%
and you start to relax into it.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But you find ease in a
fifth-dimensional space.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.190 align:middle line:90%
It's vast.

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:90%
It's dynamic.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It's living and
it's an experience

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:18.376 align:middle line:84%
that is just
absolutely stunning.

00:50:18.376 --> 00:50:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, Yeah, I'm ready for that.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:22.780 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like
a way to create.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all
have glimpses of it.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.190 align:middle line:84%
We all have our moments
where we go beyond meditation

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:32.100 align:middle line:84%
to till actually
experiencing life as ease.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.750 align:middle line:84%
But what this is
designed to do is

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:36.510 align:middle line:84%
to help take people
incrementally

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.874 align:middle line:84%
into a state where you're
basically living that.

00:50:38.874 --> 00:50:41.290 align:middle line:84%
You're not just dipping into
it for moments in meditation.

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: Exactly.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.620 align:middle line:90%
And keep it in perspective.

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.420 align:middle line:84%
That third-dimensional
glue, that magnetic field,

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.290 align:middle line:84%
is no longer there
to fight with.

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But your habits--
you still think

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.210 align:middle line:84%
it's there because
your habits are there.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:55.235 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to do
these exercises,

00:50:55.235 --> 00:50:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and begin to build
these dynamics,

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.910 align:middle line:90%
and start to recognize I'm OK.

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Mom, dad, teacher, minister
had a bad day that lifetime.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You begin to find that you don't
remember the mom, dad, teacher,

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.172 align:middle line:84%
minister, and all
those humiliations.

00:51:10.172 --> 00:51:11.338 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That makes sense.

00:51:11.338 --> 00:51:13.799 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Because they never
were yours in the first place.

00:51:13.799 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, once
you go back into your true

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.190 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, all of this
is available with all

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.557 align:middle line:90%
these exercises, as well.

00:51:19.557 --> 00:51:21.140 align:middle line:84%
We only have a few
minutes left, but I

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:23.527 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get it into one
area, because it's big.

00:51:23.527 --> 00:51:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've done other
interviews with other people's

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:26.660 align:middle line:90%
perspectives.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Masculine and feminine--
what is happening now

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.410 align:middle line:84%
in the dynamics of
masculine and feminine,

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:33.700 align:middle line:90%
in three minutes flat, please.

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: In 3D, it's your body,
my body-- masculine, feminine.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.129 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a space
in the thought realm,

00:51:41.129 --> 00:51:42.420 align:middle line:90%
in the emotional body, as well.

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.836 align:middle line:84%
You know how men
are, and you know

00:51:43.836 --> 00:51:45.640 align:middle line:84%
how women are, as you
talk to one another.

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.080 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to step into
this aspect of this higher

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:53.530 align:middle line:84%
fourth, fifth dimension,
it's not androgynous,

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:55.960 align:middle line:90%
as in sexual definition.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It begins to be something
where a feminine body can

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:04.570 align:middle line:90%
be nurturing and strong.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:08.760 align:middle line:84%
A masculine body can be
nurturing and strong.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And so you wind
up not having you

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.300 align:middle line:84%
taking those generally defined
feminine, masculine words

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.920 align:middle line:90%
that we label each other with.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And you start realizing
there's no label.

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:23.580 align:middle line:84%
You begin to create a
dynamic flexibility of choice

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.840 align:middle line:84%
where you can express
yourself in different ways.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.750 align:middle line:84%
But when you step into the
fifth-dimensional space,

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:29.740 align:middle line:90%
everything changes.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:31.006 align:middle line:90%
And there's no words for it.

00:52:31.006 --> 00:52:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because right
now what we have is,

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.270 align:middle line:84%
you have a maybe a very
strong male personality.

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a more
submissive female personality.

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And they bond
together, so that they

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:42.980 align:middle line:90%
can create some kind of whole.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.497 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually usually
a rather unhealthy whole.

00:52:45.497 --> 00:52:47.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
suffering within that.

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So these kinds of extreme
polarities in sexual feelings

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and behaviors are really
going to be dissolving

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:57.730 align:middle line:90%
into a more of this wholeness.

00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:59.813 align:middle line:84%
>> SELF: Well, in the book,
the biggest chapter is

00:52:59.813 --> 00:53:00.940 align:middle line:90%
on relationship.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And relationship is the
toughest game on the planet,

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:05.041 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
you came here to learn.

00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:07.730 align:middle line:84%
But when you start to
understand what relationship

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:12.350 align:middle line:84%
is, and the dynamics of
unhealthy relationships

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and how the Law of Attraction
attracts all that stuff

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.802 align:middle line:84%
in your backpack-- I'm not
OK is still sitting there.

00:53:19.802 --> 00:53:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And I might be a
wonderful tennis player,

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:22.680 align:middle line:90%
and I see you playing tennis.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just, you're it.

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:24.780 align:middle line:90%
You're the one.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But over time--
and we've all had

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.930 align:middle line:84%
this-- that great "you're
the one" starts to fall away.

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And what's left is what's in
the backpack, to a great extent.

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And you realize you're
attracted to people

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.870 align:middle line:90%
through their Law of Attraction.

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:40.592 align:middle line:84%
My dad beat me, and
your dad beat you.

00:53:40.592 --> 00:53:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.383 align:middle line:90%
There's a resonance there.

00:53:42.383 --> 00:53:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: It's a resonance.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin
to understand how

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:49.930 align:middle line:84%
the dynamics of relationship
work, and using the tools,

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:53.060 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
unravel "I'm not OK"

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.624 align:middle line:84%
takes on a very
rapid opportunity.

00:53:55.624 --> 00:53:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I
found it fascinating.

00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think
it's definitely worth

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:02.480 align:middle line:84%
reading this book-- and
not just reading with it,

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.747 align:middle line:84%
but working with the book,
not just reading the words.

00:54:05.747 --> 00:54:07.080 align:middle line:10%
>> SELF: Some assembly required.

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.496 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Some
assembly required.

00:54:08.496 --> 00:54:11.819 align:middle line:10%
But I really did appreciate
the relationship chapter.

00:54:11.819 --> 00:54:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Very well done, all of
it, and thank you so much,

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Jim, for taking the
time for not one,

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.361 align:middle line:90%
but two interviews with us.

00:54:17.361 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SELF: My absolute pleasure.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Again, like I said,
he's the clearest communicator

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:22.040 align:middle line:90%
of this stuff.

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And you truly are.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.170 align:middle line:10%
For the rest of the
exercises and more

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:28.010 align:middle line:10%
of the esoteric
practices of expansion,

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:31.480 align:middle line:10%
you can find Jim's new book
at masteryalchemy.com, Amazon,

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.720 align:middle line:10%
and other booksellers.

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.720 align:middle line:10%
Jim is also giving
regular classes,

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.200 align:middle line:10%
which you can find out
about through his website.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.955 align:middle line:10%
Jim's book certainly
addresses all

00:54:38.955 --> 00:54:41.160 align:middle line:10%
of the complexity of the
subjects of dimensions

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.850 align:middle line:10%
very squarely, very
easy to understand.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, it sounds like
the time of careless thoughts

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.200 align:middle line:90%
is about drawing to a close.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.756 align:middle line:84%
And we've all been
put on notice,

00:54:49.756 --> 00:54:50.880 align:middle line:90%
from what I'm hearing here.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.330 align:middle line:90%
No more sloppy thoughts.

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.934 align:middle line:90%
