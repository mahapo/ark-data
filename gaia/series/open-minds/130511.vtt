>>REGINA MEREDITH: I love
our sessions with Lee Harris

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.100 align:middle line:10%
and the Z's.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.683 align:middle line:10%
And that doesn't
mean you're going to,

00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:10%
zzz, go to sleep--
quite the opposite.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I tend to ask about unanswered
mysteries, or those things that

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
are conflicted.

we're going

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
to have an interesting
ride, no doubt.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think the ride's
already beginning for Lee.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Lee and I were going to
chat for a little while,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.640 align:middle line:84%
catch up with what he's up
to, what he's been lecturing

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.030 align:middle line:90%
on all over the world lately.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But he said the Z's are
knocking on his back door,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard for
him to stay with us.

The symbol of what you
just described here,

Regina, is true the world over.

That is, higher consciousness
has become higher,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
meaning so many of you
in the past decade or two

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
have ascended to much of
your own personal density,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
meaning the next levels
of higher consciousness

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:90%
are now hitting the planet.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Many of you will
have experienced

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:84%
a temporal hold on consciousness
in some ways between 2012

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:90%

call golden consciousness,

Far from the seductive
name it sounds to be,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:90%
it is quite destructive.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:84%
For it will destroy
density at faster rates,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
which is why at
a planetary level

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:90%
you are seeing this take place.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And at personal
levels, those of you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:84%
who had long felt what you would
call awake, alive, ascended

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:84%
are finding that
suddenly the speed

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%
is increasing all over again.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And you are going
deeper and further out

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
than humans have for
a very long time.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
For we will say that
back in time, humans

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
were able to go very far
for a short period of time

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
before what you would know as
the energetic clamp got put

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
onto the mindset and the
energy field of humanity,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
that clamp, which is
now in an almighty

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:90%
battle to restore itself.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily for the
purposes of humanity,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
but instead for the
purposes of the universe.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
We say this because many of
you get fixated on the idea

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that what you are
doing in consciousness

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:84%
is designed to directly
affect positively

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:90%
humanity and the earth.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what you are
doing in consciousness

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
is designed to
affect consciousness,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
meaning consciousness exists
far beyond the average current

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:90%
human understanding.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So all of you are
landed in these bodies,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
having these experiences, but
you come from consciousness.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is far
wider and more vast

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
than any of you at
this point understand.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Those on the planet who have
had near-death experiences

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
or the like have
felt that vastness.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Many of you who
channel meditate have

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.940 align:middle line:84%
what you would call
spontaneous awakenings.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:90%
You touch that vastness.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
But the gift of being a
human, which does not always

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:84%
feel like a gift, is
you get to come back

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:84%
into the compressed
areas of humanity

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and help illuminate
and bring light.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So to the weary
warriors watching

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
who are feeling even more
exhausted in some ways

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:84%
than usual, remember
that exhaustion

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
can be a mental pattern
for many of you now.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you are
honest with yourselves,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
your experience of light
frequencies on Earth

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:84%
have become far greater
than they ever were.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you tap into
that understanding,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.400 align:middle line:84%
you will find you
will need to dance

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:90%
into the density for less time.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:84%
The reason we say
this is there are so

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
many invitations on Earth to
drop back into your density.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
The trick for all
of you is to see

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:84%
the eighth and the ninth
door in a row of 12 that

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
is illuminated, versus
the others that you

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
will choose to walk
through that will call you

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:90%
in all sorts of ways.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So with that said,
we are honored

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
to be here with not just
you on the ground today,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:84%
but of course for this
galactic conversation

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:84%
which is taking place in
the minds and the energy

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.366 align:middle line:84%

listening in the future.

And it was
interesting this time.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Normally, Lee and I chat.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:90%
We kind of warm up.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:84%
But he could feel very
clearly that there

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%
wasn't to be the chit-chat
today that we normally

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:90%
have until the end.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And can you explain why there
was a different pattern,

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.760 align:middle line:84%
if it's of interest
to us at all?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
it is illustrated

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:90%
by exactly what we just said.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:84%
In Lee's personal
life, he started

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:90%
to take off about 20 hours ago.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So last night, he started to
notice a shift in an elevation

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
in his own frequency,
which has required

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
him to stay as grounded
as possible since then.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But of course, it
was in preparation

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:84%
for this, where he is but a
vessel for the very energy

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that all are experiencing at
this time, what we would call

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:84%
higher levels of
higher consciousness,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
the golden consciousness
that we would

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:84%
like to call the great destroyer
and the great illuminator.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautifully put.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.900 align:middle line:90%
And you're absolutely right.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
The one theme that seems
to be surfacing everywhere

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:90%
is exhaustion.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And people feel like
they don't have as much--

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:84%
they're not as up for the
good fight, as it were.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was good that
you addressed that.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.247 align:middle line:84%
If you can speak to that
a bit more, if there's

00:06:50.247 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:84%
anything else more nuanced
that you'd like to add to it,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:90%
I think that could be good.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, the
exhaustion is on two levels.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Number one, your
human bodies are

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
dealing with frequencies they
have never had to deal with.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that elevation
in frequency for so many

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:90%
is tiring.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It requires some what you would
call downtime to adjust to

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:90%
and to embed.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The myth would be
that many people

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:84%
are able to maintain a high
frequency all of the time.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That is mythic, for
as energy beings,

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
you are highly influenced by
everything you are around.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Even those of you who feel
you have worked so clearly

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
on maintaining your
own energy boundary,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:84%
you would be amazed
to see an overview

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.630 align:middle line:84%
picture of what your day is
like and how you are affected

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:90%
by all of these frequencies.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:90%
So that is one aspect.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect is
that your life as humans

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
right now is designed
to tire you out.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And there is good
reason for that.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
It is the very
clamp, this battle

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:84%
between what we would call
light and truth universally

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
for all beings, being in the
universal energy flow of life,

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and what we would
refer to as control,

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
that part which is wanting to
control life, that many of you

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.050 align:middle line:90%
are under the force of.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So as what some of you would
call a spiritual lesson,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
the good news in this
is that you are always

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.900 align:middle line:84%
as a human being
exploring consciousness,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:90%
going in and out of control.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
You are doing that
on personal levels.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And indeed ultimately, the
body has control over you

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:90%
in terms of its lifespan.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Even if you are able to
create a high frequency

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
in your physical form
that can extend your life

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:84%
span beyond human
capacity, for most of you,

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:84%
the umbrella that you are
operating in has its limits.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But we are talking about a
different kind of control,

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that kind of control that
comes in from outside

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and wants to contain or
take your life force.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So we know there are many
ideas and arguments about this

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, but we would
say it is best for all of you

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
at your levels who
are listening to not

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
get too attached to the
forms or the stories,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
but instead to look at it
simply as a battle between light

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:90%
and dark in its purest form.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And humans
are essentially

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.165 align:middle line:90%
the pawns being utilized?

00:09:15.165 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Not just humans.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:84%
We would say all life on this
planet which is far broader,

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:90%
as you are aware, than humans.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And we do not mean
to disagree with you.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We simply say that there
can be in the psyche

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and particularly
in those who are

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:84%
conscious of the battles
taking place on Earth,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
a very us and them
experience that takes place.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.520 align:middle line:90%
They are after the humans.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:90%
It is more than that.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:84%
The resources of the
planet are actually

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.315 align:middle line:90%
more important than the humans.

00:09:43.315 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed when speaking
with my own guides as well that

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:84%
like you, and those that have
that integrity, that they

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
will acknowledge what a lot
of us know in this community.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.610 align:middle line:84%
We call it conspiracy theory,
though it's not really

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.830 align:middle line:90%
a conspiracy.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.474 align:middle line:90%
It's not a theory, let's say.

00:10:04.474 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
They'll acknowledge
that, but I've

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
noticed that none of
the beings will directly

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:84%
tell us about the nature of it
in terms of who's doing what.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, don't identify
too much with the particulars.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Explain the reason
that it's felt

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:middle line:84%
it's best that we don't know
the particulars of these control

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.790 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because the control
mechanism is not as menacing

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:90%
as you think.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is a hard
one to swallow

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
for many of you who have
woken up to this reality

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:90%
that the control exists.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the very battle
to direct your attention toward.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.570 align:middle line:90%
But the truth is, it is minute.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
What we mean by this is
think of those Russian dolls

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Every time you
see the next doll,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
it just gets bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So the layer that most of you
are dealing with in humanity

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:90%
is very minute.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to be shown
the next layer of truth,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
you would have another
question and another question

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and another question.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
What we will tell
you is, many of you

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
have incarnated,
as you are aware,

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:90%
are Atlanteans in your essence.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is a time when
more Atlanteans are

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:84%
incarnate than
ever before because

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
of this great destroyer and
great illuminated energy

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis itself
wrongly harnessed,

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.085 align:middle line:84%
and instead destruction
was what was caused.

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
thank you for that.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's been my understanding
that-- also, this

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
is my point of view,
and please correct me

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:84%
if I'm inaccurate on this,
that the essential nature

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.350 align:middle line:84%
of the human being,
the being aspect of us,

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness,
the purest aspect,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
is actually a much more
refined frequency than anything

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.175 align:middle line:84%
attempting to control it-- more
intelligent, more creative,

00:11:52.175 --> 00:11:52.975 align:middle line:90%
and finer.

00:11:52.975 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: This is true.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:90%
This is pure source energy.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
we ask all of you

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
to start looking at it as a
war between light and dark.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.915 align:middle line:84%
For there are so many stories
and these other doorways

00:12:03.915 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that we spoke of
at the beginning.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
There are 12 doorways laid out
for you, and only two of them

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:90%
hold illumination.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And your job every day is
you get more finely tuned

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:84%
around walking into
the light of your life.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that requires
healing some dark for a while.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So it is not that every
day should be light--

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:90%
quite the opposite, in fact.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
It is a dance between those
two poles in the self.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
But many of you, just as people
are getting seduced right now

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:84%
in America with focusing on
politics and the election

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and picking apart each
candidate and their policies,

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:90%
that is distraction.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that
what you are looking for,

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:84%
all of you, is to connect to
as much source and light energy

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:90%
in yourselves as you can.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
ultimate weapon.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But the distractions
are for all of you

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
there and in place for you
to explore and consider.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And you are in essence
co-creating those distractions

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:90%
as you are in harmony with them.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is why when you
asked us the prior question

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and asked for more elaboration,
it is far less pointed

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:84%
than many of the current
understandings of conspiracy

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:84%
theories or control
on the planet

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
like to believe
from the human mind.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
The reason we are not
being evasive, exactly,

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:84%
for we are not trying to
deny you your answers,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
is we are saying that within
the next layers of consciousness

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
so many of you are

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
going to return to
essence in a way

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.640 align:middle line:84%
that you will let go of
form at an all new level.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Some of you like to
call it story on Earth,

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the
story of your struggle

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:90%
or the story of your suffering.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
That is beginning to
happen for many of you.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
almighty purges

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:84%
taking place inside
your emotional,

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:84%
your energy bodies, and
your psyches in order

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%
for you to get to
that place where

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
no longer do the old wounds
need to return to the old story

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:90%
to be healed.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.592 align:middle line:84%
Now, that will take some
time to become more stable.

00:14:00.592 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But that is what many
of you are entering

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
into now, which is
why your attachment

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
to the stories and the
forms becomes a lot less.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And you see, even with
us speaking to you

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:84%
at this level, we are
aware we are losing

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
certain people in their
understanding of what we

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
are saying, which is fine,
because the frequency is

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:90%
the emitter.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And the energy of what
we are bringing through

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:90%
is what is important.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But this is why we simply
could not go further

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:90%
with the higher levels.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to be
here to support you

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:90%
to open to more source energy.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:84%
For that, as we said earlier,
is the ultimate weapon

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:90%
against control.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I have been perceiving

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
is whether it's a deep
collective desire or need,

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:84%
even, for the more are divinely
courageous aspects of self

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:90%
to begin re-emerging.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Because going on
this journey does

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
require commitment
and also courage.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And this has taken us into
tales, stories from the past

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that I think many have wondered,
were these just stories

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:84%
or were these
truthful events that

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:84%
have been passed down and maybe
embellished through the ages?

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like to
speak to you about a few

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
of the specific ones.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
would please further

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
explain why this
deep fascination

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
with these heroic kind of
roles at this time on a kind

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:90%
of a mess psyche level.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is our
beloved tale of King Arthur,

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
his knights of the Round Table,
and the kingdom of Camelot.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.796 align:middle line:84%
This comes back again and
again throughout history.

00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: A deep
connection to Atlantis,

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:84%
which is why you are
bringing it up at this time.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantean energy is
strong in that story.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And what we will tell you is
from our perspective, what you

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.640 align:middle line:90%
are describing is holographic.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So rather than it being
physically actualized

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:84%
on your planet, it
was holographically

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
inserted into your
Earth history.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:90%
So it is a true archetype.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:90%
It is a true story.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.320 align:middle line:84%
It is a truth for all of you,
for the energy was infused.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But it was created in
some ways in Atlantis.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
We say this because it is not
that the Atlanteans formulated

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.290 align:middle line:84%
the story and then
sent it to Earth.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:84%
It does not work in
such a production line

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:84%
linear way where
energy is concerned.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.730 align:middle line:84%
But what we will say is in
the answer to the last part

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
of your question, a story
that is embellished still

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:84%
becomes true as
people align with it.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So all stories become true
as you make them true.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you are saying that
the story was projected maybe,

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:84%
oh, about 1,000 years
ago into the mass psyche?

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It's dated as of
about 1,500 years ago.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But it really
wasn't spoken about

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:84%
or written about until
about 1,000 years ago

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:90%
in the Dark Ages.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And what was going on
our planet at that time

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that needed that
holographic input

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:90%
to become known or prevalent?

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE HARRIS: Well, again,
you have over the years

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.624 align:middle line:84%
had many controls on what you
earlier referred to, Regina,

00:17:18.624 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
as earth magic, but
also beyond earth

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
magic, the magical energies that
the universe itself can create.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So as humans, you were
clamped into these bodies

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and put into control
suits and thoughts.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:84%
The holographic
insertion of this truth,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.040 align:middle line:84%
for we will say that
many of those people

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
existed, just as the Bible
is not a fabrication exactly,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
but there is
embellishment and overlays

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:84%
put on to some of the
people in that story.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it
becomes somewhat

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
ingrained in the psyche and
in the energy body of everyone

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:90%
who has heard the folklore.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
it was positively

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:84%
put there was because the magic
that is spoken of in that time

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
is the way that all of you
could understand consciousness

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84%
This was a very
dark time for Earth.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And even though many of you like
to think of this time as dark,

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:84%
we will say it is far, far
darker the further back you go.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the magic needed
to be a little more, shall

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:90%
we say, separated.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:84%
You are at a time
right now where

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.480 align:middle line:84%
the magic is very up close
and personal to all of you.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So we will say that just as you
are seeing on your planet now,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
there was a light and the
dark agenda with that story.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.580 align:middle line:84%
The reason it was able to
ground into the culture

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.430 align:middle line:84%
was because the forces that
wanted to keep humans enslaved,

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and indeed the
whole planet, they

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:84%
saw the power in the archetypal
struggle and fight and power

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:90%
battle.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.600 align:middle line:90%
So they let it through.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But it was infused with a
light from beyond the Earth,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:84%
universal light and
universal forces that

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
were designed to gently
but powerfully help people

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:84%
remember what they
have inside themselves.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:84%
The story brings along
with it these, as you say,

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:90%
epic light and dark battles.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time,
what it leaves people with

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
is this incredible
respect for right

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and honorable action for
courage in the face of darkness.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me-- and
I know that a lot of times

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:84%
in my own life, I
tend to feel things

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:90%
that emerge later on at large.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm feeling an epic
draw to those traits

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:84%
within humankind right
now, that a lot of them

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
tend to be in masculine
form, but the feminine

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:84%
embodies these in
our way as well.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Can you see that the need for
this as we are in history right

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
now and where we're going and
what we're working with by way

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
of this battle of
light and dark is

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:84%
going to require this
noble, honorable action,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:84%
this almost righteousness
by way of a path of being?

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It already
does require and exhibit

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:90%
that on Earth.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is where some of
the, shall we say again, dark,

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:90%
loses its power.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.480 align:middle line:84%
For the more light and
benevolence all of you

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:84%
are sharing as human
beings, you are

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
changing the influence
of the planet,

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and not just the planetary
body on the surface,

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
but it goes down and up and
affects the whole energy field.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:90%
And that changes everything.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So what we will say is the
reason that magic has featured

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
so strongly for so many of you
in these past couple of decades

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:84%
especially, is it is coming
back to people's consciousness.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And the first way to get
people to relate to it

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:84%
is to make it a
distant story, to make

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:84%
it a little fantastical,
to put it in the past.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.987 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of it
is what draws people.

00:21:02.987 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And what we will
say, and this relates

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
to sharing of how the stories
get embellished over time,

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
you will see that the way that
the Arthur and Merlin story is

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.372 align:middle line:84%
presented now in your
current media and in stories

00:21:16.372 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
is very different to
how it was presented

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:84%
60 years ago, because of the
influence of the new levels

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:84%
of emotional and
thought consciousness

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:28.140 align:middle line:84%
that people are willing to
receive and see and feel.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So you see the stories
grow as you grow.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.196 align:middle line:84%
And at this time,
what we will tell you,

00:21:33.196 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:84%
you spoke earlier when
you were addressing

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
the exhaustion of so many, what
we might call solo warriors,

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:90%
solo lightworkers.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:84%
The big shift for all
of you in consciousness

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
in the next five to
10 years especially

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:90%
is to join up as a community.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Not join up as a community
with different agendas

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:84%
as to what that community
should be doing.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:84%
This is where judgement and
comparison between yourselves

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.436 align:middle line:84%
is being worked on right
now at a very big level.

00:22:01.436 --> 00:22:05.650 align:middle line:84%
You are stopping judging or
fearing each other in ways

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:90%
that you used to.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.908 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
tandem with that,

00:22:07.908 --> 00:22:09.580 align:middle line:84%
you are seeing gross
aspects of that

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:84%
play out through the
threat of war here, there,

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and everywhere.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But in mass
consciousness, there is

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:84%
more of the unity beginning
to appear between those

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
who previously only saw
difference and were encouraged

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:90%
to see difference.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:84%
That is where all of your
strength is coming from,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.130 align:middle line:90%
all of you.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:90%
That is where to go next.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So the solo warriors who are
exhausted, you will repair.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
But your trick now is to go
into tribe and into community

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and to become a web
of illumination,

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
even if your agenda
is not, shall we say,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:84%
discussing higher consciousness
matters or spiritual matters

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:90%
for the person.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Your hearts have
changed, all of you.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
The hearts on the planet
are changing fast.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you connect up,
a very different grid

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:90%
starts to illuminate.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Being together is the
greatest force all of you

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:84%
will have in the coming
two to three decades.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, this fascination
with the notion of King Arthur

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and Merlin, and such people
that exhibited these abilities

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.830 align:middle line:84%
as Merlin, which I think were
rather common in Atlantis.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I think these were
common abilities

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.070 align:middle line:90%
that we possessed at that time.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Am I correct on that?

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
We will say, though, that even
though the group in Atlantis

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:84%
were quite harmonized in what
they were working towards,

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
there were very
different levels of power

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:84%
within those individuals,
which is not always discussed.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So it is not so dissimilar
now on your planet.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.844 align:middle line:84%
It works quite well for all of
you to work in pyramid form,

00:23:41.844 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:84%
meaning you have someone who
is at the top of the pyramid,

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
someone who is in the
middle, and someone

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:84%
who is at the bottom, and
then people in the center.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So you still like working
in pyramids, because it

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.645 align:middle line:90%
elevates your consciousness.

00:23:52.645 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
my understanding

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:84%
that it is always that way,
proportionally speaking, what

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:90%
you just said.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Even if the
consciousness continues,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:84%
as the consciousness continues
to expand and lighten and move

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:84%
upward in its frequencies,
that those base numeric kind

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
of dynamics stay in
place on this planet.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that basically correct?

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
The best example
we could give you

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.420 align:middle line:84%
is that one jigsaw piece
is never the whole jigsaw.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But when the whole
jigsaw is connected,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
it can feel part of the whole
jigsaw and recognize its place.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But it can never on its
own be the whole jigsaw.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is where some people
get tripped up with oneness.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.270 align:middle line:84%
They think that
when they have lost

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:84%
that feeling of being part
of a tribe and a hive,

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.090 align:middle line:90%
they are doing something wrong.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
But you see, you
must remember energy

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:90%
is moving all of the time.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So your linear mind has been
taught wrongly that you can

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:84%
hold on to things, and
of course you cannot.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.635 align:middle line:84%
It is not the way of the
universe, let alone humanity.

00:24:54.635 --> 00:24:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me ask
you, because again,

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:58.424 align:middle line:90%
we're poking around in history.

00:24:58.424 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.294 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
a larger lens

00:25:03.294 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at it through.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
came to my attention recently

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
is that the Sphinx,
for example, we

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:84%
have been told that under
one of the paws of the Sphinx

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:90%
is a chamber.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And the chamber
has-- we don't know

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:84%
if it has or hasn't been opened,
but certainly its contents

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:90%
have not been made public.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It's my understanding there
is technological information

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:84%
in there as well as spiritual
technological information.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us what's
actually under that paw

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.436 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for it to be
released or rediscovered?

00:25:34.436 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That we cannot,
for it is shrouded.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's shrouded, OK.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Not by us.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not by you, OK.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But your questioning
is on the right lines,

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.110 align:middle line:90%
as you would say.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Yes, something that does speak
to more of our true potential

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:90%
as human beings.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And as you are
aware, there are many,

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, special
or sacred areas

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that are publicly
known about, even if it

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:90%
is a minority of the public.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But there are multitudes
more that no one knows of.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So they are useful focuses
to divert people's attention.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
There is a great deal happening
underground on your planet,

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.340 align:middle line:84%
as many of you are
aware, and a great deal

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:23.780 align:middle line:84%
of crystalline energy is being
utilized and powered there,

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:84%
some for the betterment of the
planet and some not so much.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it fair
to say, as in a couple

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.690 align:middle line:84%
of previous interviews
I've done recently,

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.870 align:middle line:84%
that we have collaborating
species, so to speak,

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that live underneath our
earth or underneath our oceans

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.280 align:middle line:90%
as well as on the earth?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying this in
any kind of alarmist way

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:84%
or even certainly not to
instill any kind of fear.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying, is
it is it fair to say

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that this planet has been
shared for a long time

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.595 align:middle line:90%
with underground species?

00:26:54.595 --> 00:26:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: For a very long
time, and even in locations

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:84%
other than the ones
you have described.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:84%
We will also say
up on the ground.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:10%
It would surprise many.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.370 align:middle line:10%
But again, this is where your
own galactic heritage comes

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.600 align:middle line:10%
into play, for there
is an idea of humanity

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.380 align:middle line:10%
as human, which is a little
incorrect, shall we say.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:84%
There is often this
pitting of alien and human,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and the two being
seen as very separate.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But in the same way that you
are learning through your race

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.320 align:middle line:84%
relations healing on
the planet, that there

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is no separation between you
and that of another being

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:90%
with a different skin color.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.390 align:middle line:84%
There is far less
separation between you

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and what people perceive
to be alien life

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:41.980 align:middle line:84%
forms than any of you
would care to know,

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
even those of you
who research it.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, this goes back to
the Russian doll syndrome.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The more you know, the more
you go to the next level.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Think of it as a video game.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is very much
what Earth can be looked

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:90%
at crudely for as human beings.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You are constantly going up
the levels of your humanity.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.240 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, there are
a great number of you who

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.970 align:middle line:84%
are moving far faster
through your ascension

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.550 align:middle line:84%
in your own individual life than
the Earth is capable of doing.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
That is why so many of you get
so frustrated that disclosure

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:18.580 align:middle line:84%
or Earth changes or a new world
is not arriving outside you.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And as all of you who have
had to go through that process

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:84%
know, that is not where you
should place your focus.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Keep working on yourself,
and you will contribute

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.250 align:middle line:90%
to the faster illumination.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:84%
For the jigsaw needs to light up
before the planet can take off.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And we do not mean that in
a spaceship kind of way.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:84%
We simply mean the planet needs
to move to a different position

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.860 align:middle line:90%
universally.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.495 align:middle line:84%
And it is trying to, but
it is being held down.

00:28:45.495 --> 00:28:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about for a
moment about junk DNA, now

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that we have more sophisticated
means of viewing DNA.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to soon
be able to discern

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:84%
what some of what they
consider that, quote,

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:05.040 align:middle line:84%
"junk DNA" actually is,
by way of alien genetics?

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Not if you are
not allowed to know that.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So there is a battle going
on around disclosure now

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that has quite surprised
certain people on the timeline,

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:84%
meaning there was an idea of
how disclosure was going to go,

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:84%
which would have
involved alien genetics

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:90%
and the revealing of that.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:84%
But even within the groups
who are what we would call pro

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and against a disclosure
happening soon,

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.510 align:middle line:84%
there is quite the
struggle going on.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.290 align:middle line:84%
You see, this is
where many of you

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:38.820 align:middle line:84%
who get a little afraid of the
idea of a controlling force

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:90%
on the planet, be not deceived.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They are not in control
and immune to this energy.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.910 align:middle line:84%
They too are going through
their own struggle for control.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And as consciousness is
changing on the planet,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
it is affecting
them quite wildly.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So in answer to your
question, that information

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:84%
coming out or not
is certainly not

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:84%
slated for soon because of
the mainstream consciousness

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:90%
that people are being held in.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The manipulation
of DNA-- or I wouldn't even

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:09.510 align:middle line:90%
say that.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd say more the splicing in
our deep history of our DNA

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.020 align:middle line:84%
with a variety of
other species, that's

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:84%
not something I find
particularly intimidating.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It seems rather obvious when you
look around the planet that we

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.010 align:middle line:90%
have different sources of DNA.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.990 align:middle line:84%
We have different physical,
emotional, mental, collective

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:90%
traits and so forth.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And is it fair to say that
not all that manipulation

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
of our DNA or
splicing of our DNA

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
to create this unique human
code now, it was not all

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.650 align:middle line:90%
for ill purpose.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming some was
necessary, perhaps,

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.860 align:middle line:84%
in a given region
at a given time?

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: In many ways, it
was the birth of humanity.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So we do not see a negative
around what has taken place.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.050 align:middle line:84%
For what has taken place has
taken place, and what is taking

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.840 align:middle line:90%
place now will take place.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.660 align:middle line:84%
But what we would say to you
is while you and many others

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.760 align:middle line:84%
do not have fear or alarm
about that, the very separation

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and fear that so many people
are being held in right now,

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.060 align:middle line:84%
it would create
eruptions inside them

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:22.470 align:middle line:84%
that would alarm their system
and, shall we say, jeopardize

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:23.300 align:middle line:90%
their awakening.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:28.690 align:middle line:84%
For if you awaken without your
nervous system's agreement,

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.160 align:middle line:90%
it can put people over the edge.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So because of the
amount of fear that

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:84%
has been put there
towards your alien origins

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:84%
in many of your
media sources, it

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:84%
has designed slowdown
on disclosure.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:84%
For to go to disclosure now
would alarm too many people

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and would in fact upset
the balance of not

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:55.426 align:middle line:84%
just the universe, but what
is taking place on Earth.

00:31:55.426 --> 00:31:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know that
you are aware of this

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.690 align:middle line:84%
because you've been in
connection with me before

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and you're aware of
a particular view I

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.690 align:middle line:84%
have of this beginning
of the human species

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and the mingling of alien DNA
with humans and the purpose

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.790 align:middle line:90%
at the time and so forth.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And I have felt quite inclined
to share that unique story

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.690 align:middle line:90%
with individuals.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, it actually
takes the fear out of it.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.340 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking into
my aura and you're

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:84%
familiar with this story, is
it appropriate in your opinion

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:90%
to do that?

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You are one who
is very safe for others,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.623 align:middle line:84%
for you have a compassionate
and a wide heart.

00:32:35.623 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:84%
You are a pyramid,
in many senses.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.350 align:middle line:84%
This is why your
coughing earlier

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.560 align:middle line:84%
was coming from the
base up to the throat.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.200 align:middle line:84%
For heart upwards,
you are a triangle.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So think of around 12
inches above your head

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.990 align:middle line:84%
being the top point of the
triangle and the heart line

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.150 align:middle line:90%
being where the triangle stops.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So you are one who is capable
of imparting this information

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.327 align:middle line:90%
to others quite easily.

00:33:01.327 --> 00:33:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that is why you
are in the position you are in.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:84%
However, as we said, it is
not always easy for people

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:84%
to come to terms
with that information

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.150 align:middle line:84%
if they are running
a great deal of fear.

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.920 align:middle line:84%
There is a design in the
human fear programming that

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.380 align:middle line:84%
is put there to deflect
the ability to integrate

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:90%
with that information.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we say that
people's personal awakening has

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.930 align:middle line:84%
to happen at a certain
level before they

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:84%
can be at peace with
that understanding.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is what is accelerating
all of the time on the planet.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I'll take that
as a kind of a qualified yes,

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.090 align:middle line:84%
that people that would tend to
be available to listen to what

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say
on that are usually

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.120 align:middle line:84%
people who are already moving
in that direction of inquiry.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.336 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though
it's mainstream public.

00:33:49.336 --> 00:33:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, also,
your levels of frequency

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
would not allow you
to feel so inclined

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.990 align:middle line:84%
to be open with someone who was
holding a lower density, not

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:02.560 align:middle line:84%
a worse person, just at a
lower level of density, which

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle line:84%
would therefore mean
they have not yet

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:09.050 align:middle line:84%
reached this point in themselves
where they are looking

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.174 align:middle line:84%
at life as life,
rather than going

00:34:12.174 --> 00:34:13.840 align:middle line:84%
about their day and
their habit pattern.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the new
generation coming up.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.350 align:middle line:84%
We spoke about this and
some of the wounds and pains

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.449 align:middle line:90%
that they have been transmuting.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at really
the beauty and the gift

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.659 align:middle line:84%
in the generations coming
up, the millennials,

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:37.679 align:middle line:84%
the kids that are in their
20s and early 30s who a lot

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.190 align:middle line:84%
of parents are concerned about,
because they don't-- we have

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.659 align:middle line:84%
a saying here which
is failure to launch.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:44.420 align:middle line:84%
They're not launching
out into the world

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.739 align:middle line:90%
like our fathers did at 17.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:84%
They were holding down a
job or working in the field.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:84%
And they were getting
on, getting married.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.130 align:middle line:84%
These kids are not feeling
that same clear-cut sense

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.560 align:middle line:90%
of direction, per se.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But they're feeling
and experiencing

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:84%
other, perhaps more
nuanced and finer things

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:02.250 align:middle line:90%
than previous generations.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.930 align:middle line:84%
From your point of
view, can you explain

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.013 align:middle line:90%
the gift they're bringing?

00:35:05.013 --> 00:35:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
what you describe

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.610 align:middle line:84%
is because the old
way was linear,

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and so therefore you had
to take a leap forward

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.600 align:middle line:90%
in order to be in the game.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The new way is
multi-dimensional.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you can go sideways
and circular and experience

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.320 align:middle line:84%
things in a very
multi-dimensional, organic,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.910 align:middle line:90%
and connected way.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So there is still a
sea change taking place

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:84%
on the planet which will
take quite some time to undo.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But what we will say about
those who are already

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.910 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensional is they
are the ones who are not only

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:84%
the innovators, but
more importantly, they

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.570 align:middle line:84%
are able to clean out
the lower energetics

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.120 align:middle line:90%
at a planetary level.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, this may sound
odd to many of you,

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:84%
for there are some of you who
are in what you might call

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.169 align:middle line:84%
in the middle part of your life,
where you feel that you are

00:35:53.169 --> 00:35:54.710 align:middle line:84%
the bridge between
the new generation

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and the old generation in
terms of the emotional healing

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that has had to take
place on this planet.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.370 align:middle line:84%
For when a human being's
emotions are left behind,

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:90%
they are outside their power.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.750 align:middle line:84%
When a human being has
had an emotional response

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to traumatic events, they then
leave a part of themselves

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:84%
behind and they
leave their core.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So to get back into
your full power,

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.560 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a clean
running core or who

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.610 align:middle line:84%
have the ability
to, as you notice

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.590 align:middle line:84%
an old part of your
emotional field

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that wants to return
to you as pure power,

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.340 align:middle line:90%
to be able to integrate that.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:29.541 align:middle line:84%
So these new younger
generations are far faster

00:36:29.541 --> 00:36:31.270 align:middle line:90%
at being able to do that.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So even though the
middle generation

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.100 align:middle line:84%
feel they may be
helping with the heavier

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:84%
suffering of the
older generation,

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.340 align:middle line:84%
it is in fact the
younger generation

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.180 align:middle line:84%
who then come in and
do the final sweep.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So what we will
say is that there

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:46.300 align:middle line:84%
is a great deal of
power and energy

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.670 align:middle line:84%
coming up through
those youngers.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:52.690 align:middle line:84%
The control that is on at
the moment in your planet

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:55.845 align:middle line:84%
is to try and keep everyone
busy in the existing system.

00:36:55.845 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Distracted.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That is breaking
apart, as all of you know.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:84%
The existing system
worked when the planet was

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.180 align:middle line:90%
working the way it was working.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.300 align:middle line:84%
But now everything is clear
that everything has to change.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So these youngers will find
their illumination spots.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But what we will
say is while there

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.690 align:middle line:84%
will be a few leaders coming
forward now, many of them

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:90%
are staying quiet.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are doing their
purpose and their work,

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.850 align:middle line:84%
but staying quiet
and holding steady.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And when there is a
chance for all of them

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:84%
to step forward in unity,
they will very well.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.990 align:middle line:84%
They know the
power of community,

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.610 align:middle line:84%
more than the older generations,
and this is important.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I started
to ask you about but I became

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:84%
distracted as you were
talking about the cloaking

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:84%
of the information
that will become

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:84%
available under the paw of
the Sphinx and so forth,

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and that was the notion
of feeling in it that it

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.880 align:middle line:84%
is our right out
of our curiosity

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:84%
to go around and unearth the
bodies of those from the past.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is coming up
as a Japanese research

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.810 align:middle line:84%
team has recently gone, I
think, to King Tut's tomb.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And they've used some
earth penetrating radar

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:18.690 align:middle line:84%
to locate two other tombs
that are right there.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
The immediate
assumption, just because

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.510 align:middle line:84%
of history and that
day, was that these

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.300 align:middle line:84%
are the tombs of the pharaoh
Akhenaten and the Queen

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Nefertiti.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think the idea is
that if this is possible,

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.000 align:middle line:90%
they want to dig them up.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.230 align:middle line:84%
What is your understanding
energetically

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.860 align:middle line:90%
about rifling through the past?

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We will say that
black magic does exist,

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and many of you
are aware of this.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And black magic was highly
involved in these tombs

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.430 align:middle line:90%
and sealing them.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So energetically,
quite the blackness

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.864 align:middle line:84%
will be unleashed as
these tombs are unearthed.

00:38:59.864 --> 00:39:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And that has happened
throughout history

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.950 align:middle line:84%
for those who have
gone into these tombs.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what we will say is
that the powers that be that

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.250 align:middle line:84%
would wish to control the Earth
and see chaos and destruction

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.930 align:middle line:84%
reign, they will
be very supportive

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.620 align:middle line:84%
of this happening
for that very reason,

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.780 align:middle line:84%
for they know what
it will truly do.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Whereas historians, or
those who are curious simply

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.670 align:middle line:90%
have a curiosity.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People
tend to die, right?

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Lots of weird
things happen when--

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would use the
word "plague," for many of them

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:32.180 align:middle line:90%
do die.

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually look at
the family histories of those

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:84%
who have gone in
and taken the brunt

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:84%
of that energetic opening, their
families get affected also,

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and the people who are connected
to them in small and more

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:90%
incremental ways.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But when an energy field
takes a hit of blackness,

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:84%
it permeates to all
of the energy fields

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:54.110 align:middle line:84%
that it is deeply
connected to in some way.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is why life can be
challenging for all of you

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.360 align:middle line:84%
when you are connected
to each other,

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.860 align:middle line:84%
for you are connected to each
other, which is why you do not

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:05.260 align:middle line:84%
just have dominion over your own
energy field all of the time.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.660 align:middle line:84%
It is in fact a unified energy
field that you are also in,

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.215 align:middle line:90%
and both need to be looked at.

00:40:10.215 --> 00:40:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So was the
black magic utilized

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:84%
because it was
understood in the day

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.430 align:middle line:84%
that that is utilized to keep
people away from disturbing

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:24.005 align:middle line:90%
those places?

00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would say
that the future was not

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:31.410 align:middle line:84%
being thought about, but instead
the people in question that you

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:34.660 align:middle line:84%
are speaking of, and in
fact their whole time,

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.870 align:middle line:84%
there was a great deal
of darkness in that time.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the souls
and the spirits that

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:44.630 align:middle line:84%
made these vows to stay in
those areas, and in their minds

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:84%
go to the underworld with all of
these belongings and artifacts

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and relatives and
the whatnot, in doing

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.050 align:middle line:84%
that, they created quite
an energy of dark death

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.640 align:middle line:90%
around their disappearing.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So that energy of
dark death is what

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:84%
gets unleashed on those
who go into this space

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:07.350 align:middle line:84%
until it has cleared
out, shall we say.

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What would
happen, theoretically,

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.970 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure
this has happened,

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.110 align:middle line:84%
when the graves of
someone are disturbed

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and that entity is incarnated
in this lifetime, when

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.490 align:middle line:90%
the disturbance happens?

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Is there a knocked on
effect to the entity living

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.117 align:middle line:90%
its life at this time?

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:28.574 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The
knocked on effect can

00:41:28.574 --> 00:41:30.340 align:middle line:84%
be everything from
physical illness

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.600 align:middle line:90%
to a change in direction.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But it does not necessarily
alter the life course

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:39.250 align:middle line:84%
of the individual's learning,
for they have already

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.240 align:middle line:84%
in some ways let
go of that life.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But the energetic resonance
between that person

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and the existing form that
they were in from history

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.160 align:middle line:90%
does have a ripple effect.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But we will also say
that many on Earth

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.610 align:middle line:84%
now are running multiple
lifetimes from the past.

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So there is often a
traditional idea of past lives,

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:84%
where you are running
through a life now,

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.870 align:middle line:84%
but before you
were x or y person.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, many of you
now tap into soul families

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.030 align:middle line:84%
for past lives, meaning
you essentially access

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
a whole library of past
lives that you may or may not

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:17.980 align:middle line:90%
have been at certain points.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is because you
are multi-dimensional.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So many of you were,
for example, the guides

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.940 align:middle line:84%
or the angelics
around these beings

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.560 align:middle line:84%
that you have memories of,
which is why so many of you

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:90%
can remember so many lives.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It is not necessarily that
you were every single life

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.090 align:middle line:84%
in rigid linear form, but it
is that your consciousness

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.480 align:middle line:84%
is tapping into the
energy of that lifetime

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to align with something
that for you is soul family.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's interesting.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.770 align:middle line:84%
There is a person I know
who is fairly well known

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:84%
who has the entire
body and memory

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.410 align:middle line:90%
of another well-known person.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And so of course
then it's very easy

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:01.410 align:middle line:84%
to believe that you were
embodied as that person

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:03.620 align:middle line:84%
because you have the
memory and the feelings.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And is this what you're talking
about, the explanation for why

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.474 align:middle line:84%
someone may feel as
though they were someone

00:43:09.474 --> 00:43:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and have all their
memories, but in fact

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.560 align:middle line:90%
weren't them physically?

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Well, yes.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But what we would also say
here is for those of you

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.600 align:middle line:84%
who have had romantic and
intimate relationships

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.444 align:middle line:84%
in your life, think back
across those people.

00:43:23.444 --> 00:43:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may
have two or three.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may have had
a 30 romantic or intimate

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:29.410 align:middle line:90%
relationships or more.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you fixate on one
as more important,

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.220 align:middle line:84%
or do you recognize all of them
were part of your relationship

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.390 align:middle line:90%
history?

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So we will say that
this individual who

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:43.380 align:middle line:84%
is-- we do not like
to say this exactly,

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.960 align:middle line:84%
for it has different
connotations on Earth,

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.690 align:middle line:84%
is being used to be an
example of the connection

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:53.330 align:middle line:84%
to the history that
all of you have.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So this individual, like
others in the same position,

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:03.010 align:middle line:84%
is almost being used to help
illuminate to others that this

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:04.390 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But most people nowadays,
especially those of you who

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.960 align:middle line:84%
have become a multi-dimensional,
you move through the past lives

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:90%
quite quickly.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And staying identified with
one of them for too long

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.340 align:middle line:84%
can actually be damaging
for humanity's evolution.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a very good point.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:26.420 align:middle line:84%
A quick question before we
say goodbye to all of you

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and hello to Lee,
the island of Malta--

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:37.820 align:middle line:84%
why is that particular place the
home to so many ancient sites

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.940 align:middle line:84%
when it appears to be nothing
but an inconsequential dot?

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are a lot
of military implications

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:46.060 align:middle line:84%
throughout history,
but why so many

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.340 align:middle line:84%
ancient, ancient structures
on that tiny little island?

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
remember that Atlantis

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:90%
may have been the focal point.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But even then, there
was understood a need

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.600 align:middle line:84%
for offshoots, places
that were not so, shall

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.570 align:middle line:84%
we say, going to be
sought in the future.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.880 align:middle line:84%
For even though Atlanteans were
not certain of the destruction

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.130 align:middle line:84%
they were going to wreak,
they could see the timelines

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:10.930 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And what they were all aware of
was the importance of Atlantis

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.620 align:middle line:90%
in future Earth history.

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it was
important to satellite off

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.180 align:middle line:84%
certain places that
held the energy but were

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.370 align:middle line:84%
going to be not so
scrutinized and interfered

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:90%
with in the future.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So that place holds a great
deal of Atlantean energy.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:34.020 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, many
of you have related

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.960 align:middle line:84%
to Atlantean energy
for a long time,

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.540 align:middle line:84%
because you felt
you were aligned

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.860 align:middle line:84%
with that place
and that frequency.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But Atlantis was truly the
birthing place for so much

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.690 align:middle line:84%
of what is taking place
on your planet right now.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:54.040 align:middle line:84%
It is one of three aspects
from which you birthed,

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.000 align:middle line:84%
the other being source
energy and the other

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.290 align:middle line:84%
being this human body
that you call human,

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:03.120 align:middle line:84%
but that is more universal
in nature than many of you

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.100 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
thank you for that.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Because again, we don't know how
to date things on this planet.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So if we think something's
8,000 years old,

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.870 align:middle line:84%
it's as easily 80,000
years old and no one

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:14.745 align:middle line:90%
knows the difference.

00:46:14.745 --> 00:46:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And it may as
well be for so many of you,

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.000 align:middle line:84%
for the energetics that all
of you are tapping into now

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.510 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
render linearity,

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.020 align:middle line:84%
where time is concerned,
a lot less important,

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.480 align:middle line:84%
even though it is still
required and utilized.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And that will only
increase in your futures.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And we say that not just
your futures as humans,

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.080 align:middle line:90%
but when you leave this body.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Linear time will
instead become circular.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final
thoughts that this audience

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.870 align:middle line:84%
might need to hear or
wish to hear at this time

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.132 align:middle line:90%
that I have not covered?

00:46:46.132 --> 00:46:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would say that it
is difficult for many of you

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.420 align:middle line:84%
to discern what is
light, what is dark,

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.990 align:middle line:84%
what should I listen to,
what shouldn't I listen to.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.540 align:middle line:90%
That is your job.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It is your job to
learn to discern.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.670 align:middle line:84%
We say that not to be punishing,
but understand that some of you

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:03.910 align:middle line:84%
still have this idea you
have to get it right.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.080 align:middle line:90%
You have to save the planet.

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to enlighten
yourself and humanity.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.120 align:middle line:84%
That is not your
enlightenment speaking.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.660 align:middle line:90%
That is your human programming.

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.940 align:middle line:84%
That is the you that is
never going to be enough.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.350 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the
great limiters that

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:20.060 align:middle line:84%
has been put into
your psyches and is

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.250 align:middle line:90%
reinforced on a daily basis.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So keep looking for
the light in your life

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.820 align:middle line:84%
wherever you find it
personally or with others,

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:32.390 align:middle line:84%
for that is how you not
only amplify your own light,

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:36.380 align:middle line:84%
but more importantly you start
to share it across the grid.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.490 align:middle line:84%
This is very important
to understand.

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Many of you get
fixated on actions.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And we are not saying that
actions are not needed,

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.250 align:middle line:90%
for they are very important.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And we are speaking to you from
a higher plane of consciousness

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.220 align:middle line:84%
that you will not always
be on as a human being,

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.930 align:middle line:84%
so you need not always
be focused this way.

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:58.690 align:middle line:84%
But come back to the
vastness of the intelligence

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.210 align:middle line:84%
of source energy and
source light that

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.500 align:middle line:84%
is accessible to
all of you and is

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.370 align:middle line:84%
getting stronger and
stronger as time is going on.

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.320 align:middle line:84%
You just need to be able to
slow down enough to listen.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think the
distractions have increased?

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the light energies are
getting stronger, meaning you

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.540 align:middle line:90%
need to be distracted from them.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So that is what we would leave
you with, and that ultimately,

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.540 align:middle line:84%
even though we have here spoken
about polarity contrasts, dark,

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:31.410 align:middle line:84%
light, it is important not
to see the power struggle

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:34.170 align:middle line:84%
as a power struggle,
but instead to see it

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.490 align:middle line:84%
as what is taking place
right now in your existence

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and your experience,
and something

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.260 align:middle line:84%
to find your place
within, rather

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:47.475 align:middle line:84%
than recoiling against it or
trying to run the other way.

00:48:47.475 --> 00:48:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one last thing,
what is the position or value

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:58.890 align:middle line:84%
place of being able to recognize
beauty in all its forms

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:02.920 align:middle line:84%
in taking us back into those
levels of proper discernment?

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Beauty is source,
and it affects your hearts

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.490 align:middle line:90%
very strongly.

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So when you see or perceive
you are seeing beauty,

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.400 align:middle line:84%
for often beauty is right under
your noses and you cannot see

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.430 align:middle line:84%
it, for your focus
is somewhere else,

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:17.780 align:middle line:84%
when you are able to
make contact with beauty,

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.260 align:middle line:90%
it is a heart opener.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.610 align:middle line:90%
So beauty is very important.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.060 align:middle line:90%
There is beauty everywhere.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.510 align:middle line:84%
There is beauty within the
actions between people,

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and aesthetic beauty is very
calming and soothing to others.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The balance of aesthetics
is very important.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So we would say that not
only seeing and interacting

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.750 align:middle line:84%
with beauty is important,
but those of you who

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:41.970 align:middle line:84%
are creators of beauty for
others, be that through words,

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:44.040 align:middle line:84%
through art,
through experiences,

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:84%
through homemaking, this is an
undervalued gift that you have,

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:50.600 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
very important one.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank
you so much for that.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And for all of the rest
of the wisdoms you've

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:59.690 align:middle line:84%
shared with us today and
until next time, go well.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And I guess you can
release Lee now,

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and he'll come back
in just a moment.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Z's.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.171 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: A pleasure
to be with all of you,

00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:10.395 align:middle line:84%

00:50:10.395 --> 00:50:14.223 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

00:50:14.223 --> 00:50:19.971 align:middle line:90%


00:50:19.971 --> 00:50:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome back.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:22.771 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Hi.

00:50:22.771 --> 00:50:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so from
your perspective because

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:84%
you can see some of what's
going on as they're speaking,

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.470 align:middle line:84%
what did you find
to be particularly

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:36.650 align:middle line:84%
interesting or useful
from your perspective?

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think it's
always very reassuring for me

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:43.940 align:middle line:84%
to hear that message of
the simple and the light

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and the love that
we are working on

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:48.220 align:middle line:84%
is where our focus needs
to be, because that always

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.740 align:middle line:84%
vibrationally is a
truth for me in my body.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But I can also see how
in my own human mind

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.710 align:middle line:84%
moments of assessing
the situation

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:59.769 align:middle line:84%
and looking at what's going on
and certainly in the past being

00:50:59.769 --> 00:51:02.310 align:middle line:84%
activated by some of the stuff
I was seeing, as you mentioned

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:04.370 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy theories,
you called it,

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.750 align:middle line:84%
which is a good headline
for all of that stuff,

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:08.520 align:middle line:90%
you certainly can be activating.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the things that I

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.590 align:middle line:84%
think I'm reminded to do in my
more grounded work when I'm not

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.450 align:middle line:84%
doing the channeling,
but working

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.250 align:middle line:84%
with people with their
emotional fields,

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.249 align:middle line:84%
their psychological fields,
their energy fields.

00:51:21.249 --> 00:51:23.960 align:middle line:84%
How do we get back to that
place of opening and core

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.710 align:middle line:84%
strength minus some of the
stuff that we're wrangling

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.070 align:middle line:90%
with inside ourselves?

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
asked them the very

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:37.500 align:middle line:84%
last question about the value
of beauty in all its forms.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Because where I think
a lot of people,

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.680 align:middle line:84%
the word "love" is
so misused, overused.

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not being received
as what it is intended,

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:51.480 align:middle line:84%
which is this incredible,
as William Tiller puts it,

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.160 align:middle line:90%
it's the universal solvent.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're not
experiencing it that way

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.670 align:middle line:84%
unless you're able to
elevate yourself out

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:01.374 align:middle line:84%
through meditation or some
practice into that field.

00:52:01.374 --> 00:52:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Day in and day out,
you feel like you're

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:07.170 align:middle line:84%
being assaulted pretty much
with the rest of reality.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:11.420 align:middle line:84%
But beauty, the recognition that
a beautiful moment's happening

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.650 align:middle line:84%
or a beautiful
flower or gesture,

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that is for me
a way to anchor back

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:20.295 align:middle line:90%
in to the pure essence of love.

00:52:20.295 --> 00:52:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it was interesting they
talked about the heart opening,

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:29.110 align:middle line:84%
because you talking about
love being overused,

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:33.010 align:middle line:84%
from my perspective, love
and our feelings of love

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:36.610 align:middle line:84%
or our desire for love was what
we used to awaken ourselves

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:38.800 align:middle line:90%
before awakening had happened.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it would give
you this heart rush.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.752 align:middle line:84%
Whether that was projected or
fantasy, it doesn't matter.

00:52:44.752 --> 00:52:46.710 align:middle line:84%
It was the heart rush
that you were looking for

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:48.530 align:middle line:90%
and the idea of love.

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go
beyond that and you

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.670 align:middle line:84%
can start to access
the source field,

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.110 align:middle line:90%
you see that it was a doorway.

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.835 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's why
love is so obsessed over.

00:52:59.835 --> 00:53:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What I'm saying, too--
and I agree with what you just

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.550 align:middle line:90%
said-- is that it's misused.

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:08.960 align:middle line:84%
It's so misused, which is
like, I love you anyway,

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and you know what I
mean-- this kind of thing.

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And in your family,
well, I know things

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.160 align:middle line:84%
haven't been the way
they're supposed to be,

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.400 align:middle line:84%
or, oh, no, I just
love everybody.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But those don't bring
about those frequencies.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.820 align:middle line:90%
They're hollow words, too often.

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:27.066 align:middle line:84%
And we have only
one word for love.

00:53:27.066 --> 00:53:29.190 align:middle line:84%
In other cultures, they
have many, many, many words

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:30.980 align:middle line:90%
for the qualities of love.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm saying the word
itself has been abused.

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And so to find your
way into the frequency,

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:40.730 align:middle line:84%
we have to find essentially the
keys, whatever those keys are.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And that
makes me think

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that one of the ironies for me
being a word person, my words

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.270 align:middle line:84%
have been the way I've
been able to help people

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.390 align:middle line:90%
with their openings.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Just words are so limited.

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And this very frequency
that you're talking about,

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.420 align:middle line:84%
that feeling that we can
all have of love inside

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:05.050 align:middle line:84%
or meditating and
being-- your energy

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:08.210 align:middle line:90%
does not hold that in words.

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go
to words, you already

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:12.540 align:middle line:84%
are changing the
energy around them.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.420 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
whose words and frequencies

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:17.200 align:middle line:90%
and energies are full of love.

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But again, it is just taking
you towards that place.

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And I have to smile
with what you said,

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.710 align:middle line:84%
because there are
so many people--

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:28.044 align:middle line:84%
they will say-- I think we spoke
about this on the last show

00:54:28.044 --> 00:54:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I was here-- they will
say something in words,

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:34.230 align:middle line:84%
but have absolutely no
energetic backup to it at all.

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:38.450 align:middle line:84%
It's gone into the mental
autopilot, the patterns,

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.680 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm saying
but I'm not really here.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when we say,
well, all we have to do

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:48.110 align:middle line:84%
is just love one another,
those have become a mantra

00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that almost the words are
empty to a lot of ears.

00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Whereas an experience
or feeling--

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and I use the word beauty, but
that means something wider.

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It has the frequency of love
in it-- is just another word

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:04.350 align:middle line:84%
or experience to take us into
the true feelings of that

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:05.655 align:middle line:90%
love we're speaking of.

00:55:05.655 --> 00:55:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, and
presence as an act of love.

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.560 align:middle line:84%
For me, in my journey where
I'm at at the moment, that

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.530 align:middle line:84%
feels to be the most
important thing I can do.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:17.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like, can I
be fully present?

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Because in that then
there is a space of love

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:21.990 align:middle line:84%
because there is a
connection, which

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:24.790 align:middle line:84%
is very different to old
ideas I used to have about it,

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:27.575 align:middle line:84%
or what we're trying to think
about love and loving action.

00:55:27.575 --> 00:55:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes I also
found the notion

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of a holographic
projection regarding

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:36.260 align:middle line:84%
the Arthurian legends at
large, that kind of thing,

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.160 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Me too.

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.215 align:middle line:90%
It was all news to me.

00:55:41.215 --> 00:55:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And me as well,
as we're out of time.

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, that just flew.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Anything you want to tell
us just before we sign off

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.589 align:middle line:84%
about really, what you're
focusing on in your workshops?

00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:53.130 align:middle line:84%
You're all over the
world these days.

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:54.850 align:middle line:90%
You're hard to get.

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think
for me at the moment,

00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:59.620 align:middle line:84%
even though channeling
is still a big component

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:03.620 align:middle line:84%
of my work, monthly online
and in certain live events,

00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:08.510 align:middle line:84%
my passion really is undoing
the human self into awareness.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's really where
the focus of my teaching

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.690 align:middle line:84%
is going to up level in
the next year or two.

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:16.760 align:middle line:84%
There are some things I've
personally evolved through.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.380 align:middle line:10%
And then having worked with
people now for several years,

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:23.040 align:middle line:10%
I feel like my job now is to
help people access that quicker

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.240 align:middle line:10%
and maintain that frequency.

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.850 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to be
out on the road.

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm available online.

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And, well, aside from
books and everything,

00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't put down in here--
I'll do this in a second,

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.590 align:middle line:84%
but what's the quickest way
for people to reach you?

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:43.170 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: LeeHarrisEnergy.com.

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:44.040 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Lee, thank you so much.

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to the
next time as well.

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.425 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Thanks.

00:56:48.425 --> 00:56:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating as always.

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.930 align:middle line:10%
And for more of this
kind of discussion,

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:53.430 align:middle line:10%
you can go to my
previous interviews

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:55.820 align:middle line:10%
with Lee here in
the Gaia archives.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.780 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here on Gaia.
