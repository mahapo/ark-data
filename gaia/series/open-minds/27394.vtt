over 15 years-- March 13,

Arizona mass sighting,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:10%
which has become
historic in the annals,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:10%
not only of ufology, but
also of human history.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on for many centuries,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
as I found out after the mass
sighting, when I really pushed

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:84%
my entire medical career
aside to find a logical source

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and meaning for what I had
witnessed and photographed,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.429 align:middle line:84%
actually, up close and
personal two years prior.

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I
want to get into that.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.303 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about your
life a little bit prior.

00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:90%
You were normal, right?

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:90%
You were a normal person.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, not exactly normal,
but you and your husband,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:10%
you're both MDs, you're
living in a beautiful house

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:10%
in Phoenix, and enjoying
your life, as people do,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:10%
when things began inserting
themselves into your awareness

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:10%
that you would've never guessed.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I will ask
you this, would you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:84%
have intentionally called
this into your life now

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.331 align:middle line:90%
looking back 15 years?

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: That's an
interesting question, Regina,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
because both of us had
no interest or knowledge

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
in this topic at all until we
had a very close sighting two

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
years prior to
the mass sighting.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:84%
What's ironic is that
I've dedicated my life's

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
work to community education
of the reality of vital health

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:84%
issues, such as AIDS, teen
pregnancy, substance abuse

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:90%
for the community.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I have a company that
produces video and workbook

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:90%
curriculums worldwide.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And when this fell
in my lap, I have

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
to say that I felt obliged
to the same for this topic

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
without any knowledge
of it at all.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Once I saw something up close
and personal, photographed it,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:84%
didn't even know who to
ask to look at the data

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
until two years later, when
these phenomena started

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:90%
appearing again at a distance.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And I felt compelled,
whether it was

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:84%
a scientist or the experiencer
to actually document them

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
on film again up into and
including on March 13, 1997,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
when thousands of people
statewide and beyond our state

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.554 align:middle line:84%
actually had an experience
similar of these phenomena.

00:03:25.554 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's talk
about the things that

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
happened prior to that, the
sightings prior, because, as I

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
look at it, it appears
you were being conditioned

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:90%
for something.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people
spend their entire lives

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:90%
and never see these things.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people spend
hour after hour looking out

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.850 align:middle line:84%
into the evening sky, hoping
to see something, and never

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:90%
see anything.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And yet, these things
were coming, in essence,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:90%
to you to be seen for purpose.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.121 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm saying that.

00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:90%
I know you aren't.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying I think that
it was for purpose.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you were
someone who was

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
going to pick it up and run
with it once you were confronted

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:90%
with something major.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the very
first events, what those were,

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
what it looked like, and
how it appeared to you.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Well, each of us comes
from a different background,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:84%
a different upbringing, a
different belief system.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Some people can't deal
with it, some people

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:90%
don't want to deal with it.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
For myself, I've
always been open.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.620 align:middle line:84%
I actually had an
earlier experience

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
as a child, which
is very interesting,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
because a number of witnesses
to the Phoenix Lights

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.695 align:middle line:90%
also had similar experiences--

00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Will you
tell us about the--

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: --near-death
experience--

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: --which
we can get into,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Which,
actually, set, I think,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of being
open to the possibility.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Although I come to this
forum as a healthy skeptic.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:84%
One must be open as a
physician to anything

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:90%
walking through the door.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
to us in 1995, we

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.890 align:middle line:84%
lived mountainside in Paradise
Valley, Arizona, pretty high

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:90%
on the mountain.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And one wall of our
bedroom is a window.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have a panoramic
view of the city skyline.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So we know what helicopters
and street lights,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:90%
and plain lights, and--

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sky Harbor Airport--

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Sky Harbor
Airport activity looks like

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: --planes
coming in and out.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So when this happened,
actually, my husband

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:84%
saw it first and
called me out of a bath

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
to see what was
a little below us

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.385 align:middle line:90%
over a private gated community.

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of nestled
in the mountains,

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.926 align:middle line:84%
so there's no way it
could have been military.

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And here we see three amber
orbs in a triangle formation--

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
one on top and two
closely aligned

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
underneath-- about 50-75
feet off the ground, very

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:90%
treacherous ground.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately
looked underneath,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:90%
it was no one there.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And wondered what
is this phenomenon?

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:84%
It was just so
extraordinary, but I

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.705 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to move to
grab my camera at the time,

00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know
how long it would last.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to take everything
in mentally-- the size,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:90%
the shape, the color.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:84%
They were about
3 to 6 feet each.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:84%
They were oval-shaped,
like an egg on its side.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And there were three distinct
objects in a pyramid formation.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And the color within each
orb-- and I call them an orb,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
because light did not
extend outside the edge-- it

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
was self-contained, which
you'll hear over and over again

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:90%
from witnesses worldwide.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself, if I
don't get a picture of this,

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
because it was mesmerizing,
no one's going to believe it.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And I ran to the closet
to grab my 35-millimiter,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
which I keep handy to capture
beautiful sunsets in Arizona.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.102 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm doing so, my
husband calls me back.

00:06:25.102 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:90%
He says, get over here quick.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:90%
One of them is disappearing.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And as we watched in awe,
the top orb, without budging,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:84%
started to dim, as if
on a dimmer switch.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
It's really difficult
to describe.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
It was as if it was dimming
and imploding slowly

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.230 align:middle line:84%
inward till it was a small
dot, and then it was gone.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But it felt like
it was still there.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
That was so unusual,
which I didn't

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:90%
realize until afterwards.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.394 align:middle line:84%
It really felt like
it was still there.

00:06:52.394 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And I jumped out on the
balcony, got a quick picture

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.530 align:middle line:84%
of the two lower orbs,
and immediately noticed

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
an eerie silence as
if time had stopped.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:90%
It was just bizarre.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And as intently as I'm
watching these two lower orbs,

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I have to admit that it felt
like something was watching me.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.554 align:middle line:84%
And going through my head,
I was thinking who are you,

00:07:12.554 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
what are you, do know that I'm
here, I'd love to meet you.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't share
that with a soul

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.326 align:middle line:84%
until after the mass
sighting two years later,

00:07:18.326 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:90%
but that's what I was thinking.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I remember,
the left bottom orb started

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
to dissipate, just like
the first, the top one had.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And I quickly shot
a picture of that.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.790 align:middle line:84%
What was amazing is
that not only don't I

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.209 align:middle line:84%
remember much after
that, but that

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:84%
was the only picture that
turned out at the time.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it was confirmation
that something unusual

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:90%
did happen.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:90%
It was very close.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to catch
one of the orbs half

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.992 align:middle line:90%
disappeared and one still there.

00:07:46.992 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't even know
who to show it to.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I knew no one who was
interested in this

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and just wondered
for two years what

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.590 align:middle line:84%
this advanced
technology that seemed

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to have an
intelligence behind it

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.580 align:middle line:84%
was doing outside
our bedroom window.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until two months
before the mass sighting--

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and this is really
important data

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
that, unless you read my
book or know my story,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:84%
you're not familiar
with, because two months

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
before the mass sighting,
the same phenomena

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
appeared at a distance.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting, when we
went back and actually analyzed

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
the '95 photos,
they're in the photo

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:84%
as well in the same
exact location.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And here were this line
of orbs that, again, I

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
felt compelled to
document on film,

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.090 align:middle line:84%
the second night of
which, I actually

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.304 align:middle line:84%
caught this phenomena head
on turning into a V-shape.

00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was so unnerving that I
called around the next morning,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:90%
because it was so massive.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:84%
And not having an
explanation for '95,

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.185 align:middle line:90%
I thought, what is this?

00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
This is so unusual, out
of our realm of reality.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And found air
traffic controllers

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:84%
at Sky Harbor
International Airport

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.080 align:middle line:84%
who saw the same thing
at the same time.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it showed up on--
didn't show up on radar--

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.992 align:middle line:84%
but it showed up in class
B restricted airspace,

00:09:01.992 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
which is really
important to note--

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: --which alarmed
them, because anyone

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
within a 30-mile radius from
the center of the airport

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:84%
must call in to the tower to
report that they're coming

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
into that area, especially if
they're 1,000 feet altitude,

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:90%
which these phenomena were.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So they grabbed their
binoculars to look.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And what they saw
in their own words

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
were six points
of light, totally

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
equidistant from each other--
massive span over a mile

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.452 align:middle line:84%
wide-- that seemed to be
attached to something.

00:09:30.452 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't quite see
what it was attached to--

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and you would hear that again
during the mass sighting--

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:84%
actually, turning
against the wind.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
a meteorologist,

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:84%
so he knew what he
was talking about,

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and then slowly moving as a
unit behind South Mountain.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:90%
So I said, so what was it?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And there was silence.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the air traffic
controllers says, beats me.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, you're air
traffic controllers.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to know
what's in our air space.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:90%
They had no clue.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I continued
photographing these things up

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:90%
onto and including March 13.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:84%
For me it was another night,
but the same phenomena

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
popped up in the same
location that night.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I was confirmed again by
the air traffic controllers

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
as appearing about 1,000
feet altitude in class B

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
restricted airspace on March
13, which I captured on video.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that thousands of
people for many, many hours--

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
that's the other
thing, Regina, there

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
is so much mis- and
disinformation out there.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.372 align:middle line:84%
This took place for
many, many hours.

00:10:25.372 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:90%
We have reports--

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, are we talking
about the night of the event?

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Of March 13--

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: --the night
of the mass sighting,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.141 align:middle line:84%
which actually began at
3:00 in the afternoon.

00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's talk about it.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
trajectory of it as well.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: OK, we have reports
coming in from Nevada.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:84%
We have reports in Arizona,
daylight sightings at 3:00 PM.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:84%
We have a sighting in New Mexico
by Native Americans at 5:30

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon, as well
as 7 o'clock, about 7:15

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:90%
in California.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
At 11:30 there was actually
a commercial airline crew

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and 140 passengers who
were passing from Phoenix

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to California who saw the
same phenomena hovering

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:90%
over Las Vegas.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's an interesting
story in and of itself.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:10%
And then at 3 AM the
following morning,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:10%
there was a call to the
National UFO Reporting Center

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:10%
in Seattle, Washington, Peter
Davenport, the director,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:10%
received a call from
the ledge crewmen

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:10%
from Luke Air Force
Base, very detailed.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.635 align:middle line:10%
In fact, we have the recorded
message in the documentary--

00:11:31.635 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:10%


00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:10%
--that shares that not only
was one of the objects--

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:10%
because it wasn't just
one or two events, which

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:10%
you hear in the media--
there were many events,

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:10%
as I said, for many, many hours.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they happen
simultaneously that evening?

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.493 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Yes, yes
in different places.

00:11:49.493 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were they very
similar in formation

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
to the craft that was
seen over Phoenix?

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.345 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Actually, they
were orb formations

00:11:57.345 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:90%
in mile-wide V-arrays.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:90%
There were also numerous craft.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:10%
And if you look on the
phoenixlights.net website

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:10%
on the GAP page, Geospacial
Animation Project,

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.290 align:middle line:10%
you'll see a 12-year compilation
of hundreds of reports

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:10%
to the National UFO
Reporting Center

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:10%
in Seattle to then councilwoman
vice mayor Francis Barr, which

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:10%
she received over 1,000 reports,
as well as Village Labs, which

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:10%
was the clearinghouse locally,
and Arizona MUFON was compiled

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:10%
by investigators to show
that there were eight or nine

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:10%
different craft that
people were describing,

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:10%
which is pretty amazing, because
they look very different.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether it
was one craft that

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
could morph into
looking differently

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
or it was a series, a parade,
going through the entire state

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.142 align:middle line:84%
and beyond, which
the investigators do

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
believe, because,
as you mentioned,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
there were things
happening simultaneously,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:84%
or the perspective of where
the person was standing,

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.192 align:middle line:90%
we may never know.

00:12:55.192 --> 00:12:57.150 align:middle line:10%
But the fact is there
was one of these crafts--

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:10%
and this is what this crewman
reported from Luke Air Force

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.450 align:middle line:10%
Base, hovering right over
the center of Phoenix about

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:10%
8:20-8:30 that evening.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:84%
7th Avenue and Indian School,
military jets were sent out

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
to intercept it,
get gun camera film.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And as they got closer,
what was really interesting,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:84%
not only did their
instrumentation

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.270 align:middle line:84%
inside their cockpit go haywire,
which you will hear worldwide

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:84%
with similar cases, but
as they got even closer,

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:84%
the phenomena just blinked
out and freaked out

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:84%
one of the pilots,
which his crewman said

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.227 align:middle line:84%
he helped out of
his own aircraft.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's really interesting--

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
he was so shaken.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.236 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: So shaken up by it.

00:13:35.236 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I have a report
at 5:30 the next morning,

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
the following day, on the 14th,
from a crew, a Boeing crew,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:84%
who was coming in to work
at Sky Harbor International

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Airport, who saw the same thing
hovering over their tarmac.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So this was going on
for many, many hours

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.207 align:middle line:90%
and many, many events.

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite fascinating.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is really
what differentiates it

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:90%
from most other sightings.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there have been massive
sightings throughout history,

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and the famous one's
in Mexico City.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.580 align:middle line:10%
Even in Washington, DC.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:10%
>>KITEI: Absolutely, in 1952.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: '52.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.194 align:middle line:10%
>>KITEI: But we can
find them from the time

00:14:10.194 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:10%
human documentation started.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can find them
wherever there was art work,

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:10%
wherever there's cave art--

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.588 align:middle line:10%
>>KITEI: Exactly.

00:14:14.588 --> 00:14:17.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --it's been captured,
but what was so interesting

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:10%
here is that it seemed
to be so incredibly

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:10%
purposeful to show up and
move so slowly to say,

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.982 align:middle line:10%
hey, look up, whatever we are,
whoever they are, we're here.

00:14:31.982 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Well, not only that,
there was miraculous, I mean,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
really miraculous
technology going on here.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
We're talking quite
advanced aerial phenomena,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
because not only was
this very low-gliding--

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and some people said it was
so close and so roof-top level

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that they could have thrown
a stone at it, that low.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
some people saw

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:84%
it take off at a tremendous
speed from just hovering.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Other people saw the orbs
detach from the main object,

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
go out into the
environment, and then redock

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
with it, which is interesting,
because if you go back

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to our '95 sighting--
and as I mentioned,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the same phenomena is
in the same location

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
in the background, while we
were taking the close pictures.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that's what
happened in '95.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:84%
What's also interesting
about that, which I do not

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
believe in coincidence
any longer,

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:84%
there are so many serendipities
that occurred, particularly

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
after the mass
sighting, that I really

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
had to take note of the fact
that the puzzle pieces just

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.291 align:middle line:90%
kept fitting together.

00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting,
about six months

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:84%
before the mass
sighting, I was invited

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.700 align:middle line:84%
to present my substance
abuse prevention education

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:84%
program to the Gila Bend
Indian Reservation, which

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
is located in the basin between
South Mountain and the Estrella

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Mountain Range, which we
have a view of from our home.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And also these phenomena
keep popping up in that area.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
If you note, I always say,
that data speaks for itself,

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:90%
if you just look at it.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I found really
interesting when I did

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:84%
note that, I called them
back after the mass sighting.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was six months
before the mass sighting

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.402 align:middle line:84%
that we happened to
have this presentation.

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In that area.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And after the mass
sighting, I called them up

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and I said, did anyone happen to
see strange lights on March 13,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.990 align:middle line:84%
these phenomena
from my photographs,

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
35-millimeter photographs, keep
showing that these orbs pop up

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:84%
right in that
general area, where

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
South Mountain and the
Estrellas intersect.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.890 align:middle line:90%
And they started to giggle.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.089 align:middle line:90%
And I said, is that funny?

00:16:33.089 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:90%
And they said, are you kidding?

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:84%
We've been looking up
at them for centuries.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.590 align:middle line:84%
They call them Sky
People, light beings.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.050 align:middle line:84%
This really opened up
a whole new world to me

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that I came to learn that
indigenous cultures worldwide

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.070 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of
human documentation

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.912 align:middle line:84%
had been seeing these
phenomena and been

00:16:50.912 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:90%
noting these phenomena.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:10%
In fact, they called
the Estrella Mountains,

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:10%
it got its name from
the Spaniards, who

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:10%
visited and learn
the stories, all

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:10%
of these cultures in the area.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:10%
It means "star" in Spanish.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
believe that there

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:84%
is a gateway to the stars,
a portal in that area.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you look at my
data, it's just speculation,

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
but you have to
wonder if that's true.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
again, because we're

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
talking about cultures
all over the planet

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
throughout history,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:84%
it would be
ridiculous for us not

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:84%
to assume that they were
seeing and understood,

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and their lore contains
something real.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond coincidence
that the star people

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
are at the base of all of
these indigenous cultures.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.194 align:middle line:90%
Essentially, all of them.

00:17:39.194 --> 00:17:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: You're right.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Most things can be explained.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:90%
We have to say that.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Only a small percentage cannot.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But just because we don't
have the technology yet

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:84%
to definitively define
what these things are,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean
they're not real.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:52.456 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:52.456 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: It took 17
centuries, 17 centuries,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
before the advent of the
microscope for humans

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:84%
to really realize that there
are zillions of microbes

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:84%
all around us, even in our
bodies, some are beneficial,

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:90%
some are pathogens.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:84%
We've learned to live with
them and to deal with them.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Just as we know we cannot see
radio waves or gamma rays,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:84%
or even electromagnetic energies
that are around every living

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:90%
cell.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
But just because
we can't see them,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean
they're not real.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:84%
We may just be looking on the
AM dial for an FM frequency.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, there's
a whole other issue,

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:90%
which we're going to get into.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
concerted effort to see

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that we don't put any
credibility into the subject.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And through
disinformation campaigns

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that have occurred for now we're
going on a couple generations,

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:84%
certainly just in the
Western world alone,

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to discredit the
experience of being

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:84%
a witness to any
kind of UFO event.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But before we go
there, let's go back

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:90%
this consciousness part of it.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
As you said, when you
first saw the orbs,

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
you felt as though something
intelligent was looking at you.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.065 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
not just your feeling,

00:18:59.065 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
but the feeling of
some of the witnesses,

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many
of the witnesses.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:84%
What were some common
themes about the experience

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.917 align:middle line:84%
of being out
underneath this craft.

00:19:10.917 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: That is a
wonderful question,

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
because what's
really interesting,

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and that, of course,
perked my interest

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.511 align:middle line:84%
in this whole phenomena,
was that not only were there

00:19:20.511 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.468 align:middle line:84%
And as you mentioned,
this has been

00:19:22.468 --> 00:19:25.100 align:middle line:84%
happening since human
documentation began.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%
We have the drawings in
primitive caves of long extinct

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
animals, and in the sky,
we have these phenomena.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.220 align:middle line:84%
We have pictures in the
15th and 16th centuries

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
of frescoes, where people
are on the ground looking up

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:90%
at these phenomena.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love all of this
ancient art that contain

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:45.900 align:middle line:90%
craft--

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Right, exactly.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that shouldn't
theoretically be there.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.273 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And affected
people at a very deep level.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but Foo
Fighters, even during World War

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
II, they called them Foo
Fighters, these orbs,

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.456 align:middle line:90%
identical.

00:19:56.456 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I conferred
with Dr. Richard Haines,

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
who has studied thousands
of pilot sightings

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and the World War II
orbs, which are called

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Foo Fighters around each craft.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Everybody saw it, somebody had
this advanced spy technology.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.140 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't till after the
war that Japan and Germany

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and the United States tried
to study these phenomena.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.262 align:middle line:84%
No one knew where
they came from.

00:20:18.262 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So they've been around
a long, long time.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.761 align:middle line:10%
And certainly, we've
had similar sightings,

00:20:21.761 --> 00:20:26.556 align:middle line:10%
not only in the '50s-- the
Lubbock Lights and 60's, 70's.

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: 1917, the
Fatima sightings.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:10%
>>KITEI: Exactly.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:10%
And our orbs have been
equated with them.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:10%
And you mentioned,
over the capital,

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:10%
there were quite a few
aerial phenomenon in 1952.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:10%
And the '80s and '90s, and UK,
and Belgium, of these triangle

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:10%
craft, as well as in 2008
in Stevenville, Texas.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
sightings worldwide,

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:84%
they just cannot be
ignored any longer.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Or dismissed because
they're an anomalous.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can truly
explain what they are.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.852 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting,
that I do have to mention here,

00:20:57.852 --> 00:20:59.685 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get back to
the consciousness part

00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
because that's really
important in all this,

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:84%
is that there was no
investigation or explanation

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:90%
for months.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.775 align:middle line:84%
Nobody would talk about it in
the government or military.

00:21:08.775 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:90%
It was uncanny.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Because here something had
traversed, mile to two miles

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:84%
wide in some very credible
reports, over people's heads.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.585 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people were
actually looking up

00:21:18.585 --> 00:21:19.626 align:middle line:90%
at these canister things.

00:21:19.626 --> 00:21:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was less
than 3,000 feet up.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Oh, yeah.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.832 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They able to determine
less than 3,000 feet up.

00:21:24.832 --> 00:21:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And like
I said, some said

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:84%
it was rooftop, where
they could look right

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:84%
up into these enormous
canisters of swimming gasses.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just uncanny that
nothing was said, afterward,

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:84%
from the military or
government until-- and this

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
is really important-- about a
few months later, on, actually,

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:84%
June 18, 1997, a front page
"USA Today" article opened

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:84%
the sighting up to
international scrutiny.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
We were deluged by media
from all over the world.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.520 align:middle line:90%
As I said, the puzzle pieces.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
The very next day, on June 19th,
suddenly our former governor,

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Fife Symington, announced
that they found the culprit

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.270 align:middle line:90%
to the mass sighting.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, what was disconcerting
is that everyone took it

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:90%
seriously.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:10%
And what he did was
brought out his assistant

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.460 align:middle line:10%
in a massive alien
head and made a mockery

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.740 align:middle line:10%
of the sighting, which
really concerned,

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.924 align:middle line:10%
particularly parents,
who were with children.

00:22:25.924 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, children
were usually the first ones

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:84%
to notice this massive
V formation of lights

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:90%
coming towards them.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, it really
put a lid on it for a while.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:84%
But the witnesses themselves
were certainly not convinced.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.487 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually offensive
to many, many people.

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was very offensive.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was silly.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:90%
It was sophomoric.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And for whatever
reason, and certainly

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
we know that they want to
defuse the whole thing,

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:90%
and to make a joke out of it.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Which, as you mentioned,
is the usual case.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main
reasons I came forward,

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:84%
not only to share the
data so hopefully people

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.780 align:middle line:84%
will look at it, because
it does speak for itself.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.080 align:middle line:90%
It's so compelling.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.330 align:middle line:84%
But also the fact
that it's enough.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
It's time we get this out
in the open and address it.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Accept it.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:90%
And study it.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So, not only could we find out
who's driving these things,

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.395 align:middle line:84%
but move forward in
our own evolution.

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:10%
And that's when we get back to
the consciousness part of it,

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:10%
which is really
important to me because,

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:10%
as I was interviewing
witnesses, what really touched

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:10%
me very deeply is that, not
only were their lives changed.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whoever's doing this
is not only waking us up

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to their presence in a very
gentle, non-threatening way.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:10%
And I do have to say here
that, in over 15 years,

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:10%
there's not been one-- not on
one report-- of harm, threat,

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:10%
or abduction associated
with the Phoenix Lights.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's very telling,
in and of itself.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But also, what's
really amazing--

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get back
to the witnesses--

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
is that after-- about a
month after the "USA Today"

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:90%
article came out, I got a call.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And I really checked around.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:90%
I tried to do my homework.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I take
my 35 millimeter data

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.692 align:middle line:84%
at extreme studies at University
of Arizona Optical Science

00:24:11.692 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Department, Conscious Study
Department, Arizona State

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
University Geology, Mathematics,
Anthropology Departments,

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:84%
as well as the renowned Brooks
Institute of Photography.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And no one could tell me
what these things were.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
was that I really

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.015 align:middle line:84%
tried to do my homework
with the military, as well.

00:24:31.015 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were more
interested in seeing

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.514 align:middle line:84%
what I had than giving
an explanation for it.

00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I finally got a call a month
after the "USA Today" article

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.257 align:middle line:84%
on July 24th from
one of the head of PR

00:24:41.257 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
at the Air National Guard
saying, oh, Doctor Lynn,

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I think we know what those
lights were, back in March.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was thrilled
because I was looking.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've been looking ever
since for a logical source

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:51.641 align:middle line:90%
of meaning.

00:24:51.641 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:90%
And I said, so what were they?

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And she said, do you believe in
five months, no one ever looked

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.432 align:middle line:84%
at the log for visiting
the Air National Guard?

00:24:59.432 --> 00:25:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Maryland
Air National Guard

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:84%
was in town sending off
flares and operation--

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Suggests
the flare story--

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: --which I came to learn
meant Diversionary Tactical

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.402 align:middle line:90%
Maneuvers.

00:25:10.402 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Diversionary Military
Tactical Maneuvers.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.570 align:middle line:84%
So, there may have been some
flares, though again, we

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
have not had one
person describe flares.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:90%
But I said, well, wait a minute.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:22.490 align:middle line:90%
When were they in town?

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.242 align:middle line:84%
And she said, March
1 to the 15th.

00:25:25.242 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, were they
in town in January?

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh, no.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you sure?

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:90%
She said, absolutely.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, well.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I have 35 millimeter
photographic evidence

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:84%
of the exact same phenomenon,
in the exact same location,

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
confirmed both times two months
before the mass sighting--

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and the morning after
the mass sighting--

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:84%
as appearing in Class
B Restricted Airspace.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
never told me that.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, besides that,
you're trying to say that

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.660 align:middle line:84%
flares, particularly military
illumination flares that

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.345 align:middle line:84%
are dropped with parachutes,
they have huge smoke trails

00:25:57.345 --> 00:26:01.059 align:middle line:84%
that illuminate the flare
itself, and the smoke trails--

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not highly
predictable in their movement.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.058 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Exactly.

00:26:04.058 --> 00:26:07.120 align:middle line:84%
They haphazardly fall to
the ground in minutes.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, you're trying
to say that they

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.062 align:middle line:84%
kept a rock solid,
mile wide equidistant V

00:26:14.062 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:84%
formation for hours
throughout the entire state.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said, uh, I
have a call coming in.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:90%
I'll get back to you.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.789 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm still waiting.

00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's over 15 years later.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:22.640 align:middle line:90%
That call'll never happen.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.494 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, that story is
what most people are left with.

00:26:25.494 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>KITEI: Exactly.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Honestly.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:84%
If you ask people today
about the Phoenix Lights,

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.967 align:middle line:84%
if they don't know your
work, it was flares.

00:26:31.967 --> 00:26:32.675 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Exactly.

00:26:32.675 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
ridiculous story

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:84%
made it around the
United States, certainly.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it made it
into papers around the world

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:90%
as the flare explanation.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
people are left with.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Because by that time,
once it has been quote

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:84%
"successfully discredited,"
then people tune out.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Well, that's a
very good point because once

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:84%
that came forward-- and the next
morning, it was headline news.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Headline news.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Which was very
disconcerting for anyone

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that really saw the
true phenomenon.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:90%
And yet, OK.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:90%
I was open to it.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.720 align:middle line:90%
As were others.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And councilwoman Frances
Barwood, actually.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.921 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get to that in a minute.

00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:13.610 align:middle line:10%
>>KITEI: Three years later,
she ran for Secretary of State

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:10%
on a platform to get answers
for the mass sighting.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:10%
And one of the points
that she really pushed

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.224 align:middle line:10%
was for a reenactment.

00:27:20.224 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.547 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And finally,
and most people

00:27:22.547 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:90%
have no clue that this happened.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.890 align:middle line:84%
If you weren't there
locally or read my book,

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea
that this happened.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And this one event alone
really is very telling

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:37.280 align:middle line:84%
because three Air National
Guards announced on March 7,

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:84%
2000, that they were
going to deploy flares,

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Military Illumination
flares to show everyone

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.610 align:middle line:90%
the Phoenix Lights.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if they
thought people forgot, or would

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.580 align:middle line:84%
confuse the issue, which
certainly, everything that they

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:84%
were doing was
confusing the issue.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:90%
But we were ready.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:90%
With cameras on the ready.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And, I have to say, when
you look at that footage.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Again, it speaks for itself.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.790 align:middle line:90%
It was a joke.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:02.425 align:middle line:90%
Not only--

00:28:02.425 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was insulting.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Not only did

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:84%
they try to make a triangle,
but it was upside down.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.500 align:middle line:90%
It fell apart immediately.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.541 align:middle line:90%
It had huge smoke trails.

00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It confirmed for the
witnesses themselves

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.509 align:middle line:84%
that the Phoenix Lights
were definitely not flares.

00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:14.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:14.841 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:14.841 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
-These lights up here
represent aircraft flares.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
If you notice, they are
not in any straight line.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.677 align:middle line:84%
They vary in distance
between each other.

00:28:22.677 --> 00:28:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
top, you can see the smoke.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
As a flare falls, it leaves
a trail of smoke above it

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:84%
from the burning
magnesium in the flare.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
-Flares are moving
relative to each other.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:10%
They're moving at
different speeds.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.307 align:middle line:10%
The Phoenix Lights
are rock steady.

00:28:40.307 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:10%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.848 align:middle line:10%
>>KITEI: And to this
day, they have never

00:28:42.848 --> 00:28:45.880 align:middle line:10%
been reenacted or explained.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So now I'd like to
get back again the feelings

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:10%
of the witnesses while
this was happening.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And then some of the
calls that came in.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.090 align:middle line:90%
The chronology of events.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Because you called the next
morning, Luke Air Force Base,

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Was it the next morning
you called them?

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Well,
actually, what happened

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:84%
was the people-- as
it was happening--

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.850 align:middle line:84%
and we have a 911
police operator that

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:84%
was on duty that night,
that just retired last year.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:10%
She is now in the documentary
to share the fact,

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:10%
even though the police said
they got very few calls,

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.130 align:middle line:10%
that they got hundreds
and hundreds of calls.

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And it was very consistent.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could tell as one of
these objects was moving down,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.130 align:middle line:90%
exactly what was happening.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And the descriptions were,
not only so heartfelt,

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.400 align:middle line:90%
but also they were detailed.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And consistent.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And what was really
interesting, and certainly we

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't know this until
after, people were in awe.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.740 align:middle line:90%
No one was afraid.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:84%
That is so important
to impart now,

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is that people were just
in awe and in wonder.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And actually felt
blessed at that moment

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that they were
seeing these things.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that alone
is very unusual.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Now flares, and blimps, and
so forth, don't do that.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are not going
to create a sense of awe.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.118 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Exactly.

00:29:57.118 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't do that.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And long term,
which I also am very

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:84%
interested in professionally,
as a physician, what I found

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.450 align:middle line:84%
were a number of witnesses
who shared with me that they

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.870 align:middle line:84%
had had near death
experiences as children that

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.540 align:middle line:84%
was reawakened by
the mass sighting.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that really
profoundly personally

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.800 align:middle line:90%
because I did, too.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
does that mean?

00:30:20.465 --> 00:30:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Well--

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To have it reawakened?

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:22.953 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:30:22.953 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: OK.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
For myself, personally, now this
was when I was eight years old.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.770 align:middle line:90%
We're talking over 40 years.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I had long buried
that experience.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I knew that it was
real to me at the time.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.680 align:middle line:84%
But hadn't really thought
about it until right

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.800 align:middle line:84%
before the Phoenix
Lights reappeared.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I actually had an experience,
again another coincidence,

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.671 align:middle line:84%
that just hit me
really hard that, whoa.

00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:10%
Maybe there was a connection
between my near death

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:10%
experience and what
I experienced up

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.500 align:middle line:10%
close and personal-- in '95.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And then when I started hearing
from the other witnesses

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.970 align:middle line:84%
that their near death
experiences were reawakened

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.240 align:middle line:90%
as well, I thought, jeez.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Could there possibly
be a connection

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:84%
between all
unexplained phenomena--

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it's near
death experience, out

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.100 align:middle line:84%
of body experience, or
unexplained aerial phenomena--

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that has a mystical light
associated with the experience?

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
looking again,

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I started finding so
much credible data

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.100 align:middle line:90%
at university level.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a study that
was done years ago,

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:84%
decades ago actually, at the
University of Connecticut,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
called The Omega Project,
by Doctor Kenneth Ring,

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:35.295 align:middle line:84%
if anybody wants
to check that out.

00:31:35.295 --> 00:31:36.350 align:middle line:90%
A very thick book.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:10%
Very hard to get through for
the lay person, I'm sure.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:10%
But establishes,
as other experts

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.920 align:middle line:10%
in the field--
Doctor Raymond Fowler

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.850 align:middle line:10%
as well as others in the
near death experience realm--

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.680 align:middle line:10%
that there is a connection.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Not only in the experience
itself-- and we're

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.050 align:middle line:84%
talking from
feeling out of body,

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:01.340 align:middle line:84%
to a presence of
another intelligence,

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:84%
to seeing a white light
or some sort of a light,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.870 align:middle line:84%
to others which I really
make quite easy to learn

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.070 align:middle line:84%
in the book-- but
the aftereffect.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.260 align:middle line:84%
That was what was
so compelling to me.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:10%
An awakening, an
enlightenment that

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.190 align:middle line:10%
touches that person,
that experiencer that

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:10%
does experience it-- again,
it's a choice-- to the core,

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:10%
a reawakening of a connection
to the universe, to the Earth,

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:10%
and to each other
that, in most cases,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:10%
was never realized before.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
your witnesses on tape,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.810 align:middle line:10%
in the documentary,
speak about this feeling.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
them speak about it

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.437 align:middle line:84%
having changed
their entire lives.

00:32:46.437 --> 00:32:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Absolutely.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:47.895 align:middle line:90%
Forever.

00:32:47.895 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about something that

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:84%
has to be, I mean, for lack
of-- it's kind of a bucket word,

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:84%
almost a spiritual experience
for whatever the word

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:90%
spiritual means.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Something beyond the physical,
so metaphysical, experience

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.050 align:middle line:90%
has occurred.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Which has to be--
everything's energy,

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:11.342 align:middle line:84%
so there has to be an
energetic component to it.

00:33:11.342 --> 00:33:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: There
seems to be actually

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.960 align:middle line:84%
a vibration that
touches the person.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.480 align:middle line:84%
They're suddenly at
a different frequency

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.130 align:middle line:90%
than they'd ever been before.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.380 align:middle line:90%
If they're open to it.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.017 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first step, is
to be open to these things.

00:33:24.017 --> 00:33:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And when you really
look back, and you not only

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.810 align:middle line:84%
observe and learn--
and I'm actually

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.370 align:middle line:84%
studying that at university
level now-- the aftereffect.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.740 align:middle line:84%
The profound and
positive aftereffect.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I've started calling all
unexplained phenomenon

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:90%
U-P. An UP.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Because it is so positive.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is doing
this, and I've never

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.260 align:middle line:84%
said what these things
are, only that they are,

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.330 align:middle line:84%
whether they're spirit
world, or time travelers,

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:53.740 align:middle line:84%
or inter dimensional,
interstellar, or all

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.240 align:middle line:90%
of the above.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.200 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is doing
this is not only

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:84%
waking us up to their
presence in a very gentle,

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:84%
nonthreatening way,
one person at a time.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.730 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
waking each person up

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual beings we
are, to the positive potential

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:90%
we have.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even the ability
to connect beyond to ourselves

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.739 align:middle line:90%
and each other, but cosmically.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Absolutely.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.429 align:middle line:84%
Again, the connection
to the universe.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.137 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
these frequencies are

00:34:21.137 --> 00:34:24.909 align:middle line:84%
opening up and allowing for
maybe a lifting, a refining,

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:28.019 align:middle line:84%
of our frequencies, so that we
have access to these things.

00:34:28.019 --> 00:34:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: And so it seems.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And those that are
open to it seem

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:37.409 align:middle line:84%
to realize, and be awake, to not
only to the serendipities that

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:41.287 align:middle line:84%
come into our lives, but also to
the fact that we're not alone.

00:34:41.287 --> 00:34:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're not alone.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.159 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, we just need
to say this for the record,

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:84%
these things don't happen when
military craft fly overhead.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Exactly.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's just put
the military craft, the flares,

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.468 align:middle line:84%
the balloons, and all these
other ridiculous stories,

00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:90%
let's just put them to bed.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact is, that's not
the experience of the people.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Exactly.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we can't
discount that feeling,

00:35:02.315 --> 00:35:05.657 align:middle line:84%
and it is inexplicable
feelings and experiences

00:35:05.657 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:90%
that they're having.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And also,
they want to know more.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Just like myself.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once you have an
unexplained phenomenon,

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.430 align:middle line:84%
UP experience, it changes
your world view forever.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.431 align:middle line:84%
And you want to know
what the answers are.

00:35:18.431 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even
though this event

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.580 align:middle line:84%
did not have any of the
negative associations

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.230 align:middle line:84%
that some experience or events
have, such as abductions,

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.560 align:middle line:84%
the work of Doctor
John Mack, for example.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.624 align:middle line:90%
He's delved into that.

00:35:30.624 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Well, that-- very
interesting you should bring up

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.540 align:middle line:90%
his name.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:84%
My very first
presentation, and I

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.270 align:middle line:84%
hesitated to do it because he
was so involved with the peer

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:44.870 align:middle line:84%
institute at Harvard University,
dealing with the abduction

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.220 align:middle line:84%
phenomena, which I
don't even go there.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just out of my expertise.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
interesting is I presented--

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.080 align:middle line:84%
my very first presentation was
at University of Arizona Tucson

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Medical Center with
Doctor John Mack.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.400 align:middle line:90%
And I presented first.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was thrilled because
my data, my hard evidence,

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:08.870 align:middle line:84%
actually confirmed that
whatever was happening was real.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:90%
And he was doing studies.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what was so interesting.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.776 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was about to say

00:36:12.776 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:10%
is even in the
books that he wrote,

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:10%
as a result of his research
there-- and they tried to strip

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:10%
him of his tenure,
run him out of town.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Harvard was not kind
to him because he

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.550 align:middle line:90%
chose to take on this research.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.630 align:middle line:90%
But nonetheless, he persevered.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what was said
by the various experiencers

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.270 align:middle line:84%
was, even though they were
frightened and did not

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:38.400 align:middle line:84%
want to be taken into this
experience that was not

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.340 align:middle line:84%
of their choosing,
that often, again,

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.930 align:middle line:90%
there was this awakening.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Opening.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:90%
The sense of awe.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:90%
The sense of connection.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:84%
An emotional,
intelligent, connection,

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.450 align:middle line:84%
even with the ones who were
doing whatever they were doing.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.262 align:middle line:84%
Working, experimenting
with them.

00:36:55.262 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they were
doing with them.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.680 align:middle line:84%
But again, it had
the same thing.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, on one hand, you
think, is this some kind

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.720 align:middle line:84%
of psychotronic technology
that is zapping people

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:84%
into a state of
complacency, or whatnot?

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But again, you'd have
to say no simply because

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.610 align:middle line:84%
of the refinement of
the emotions around it.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.842 align:middle line:84%
These are very elevated
feelings that people are having.

00:37:20.842 --> 00:37:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Not that that can't
be accomplished

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.810 align:middle line:84%
with certain kinds
of technologies.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.510 align:middle line:90%
But you would say, no.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Well, you hit on a
very, very important point.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
After the lecture, we had a
very heartfelt conversation.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:10%
And Doctor Mack
shared with me that he

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.270 align:middle line:10%
was working on a
book at the time

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.640 align:middle line:10%
to show that, as you mentioned,

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.360 align:middle line:10%
even though for
the person who had

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.610 align:middle line:10%
that experience-- and Doctor
Ruth Hover, who has-- a Ph.D.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:10%
Psychologist who was
in the documentary,

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:10%
she had-- and she passed
recently-- groups for decades,

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:10%
concerning contact an abduction.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And the important point
is that, number one,

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.300 align:middle line:90%
and I say this quite fervently.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It's so important to share
whatever your experience is.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very cathartic and healing.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.030 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the reasons I
came forward as a physician.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Because, if you let it
fester, and so many people

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:84%
have been afraid to talk
about this, it does fester.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's not healthy.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And to share the experience.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
thing Doctor Mack also

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:30.830 align:middle line:84%
shared with me is that
it's so important to, even

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.934 align:middle line:90%
if it's one other person.

00:38:31.934 --> 00:38:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Email me.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.604 align:middle line:84%
I am very welcome
to all experiences.

00:38:35.604 --> 00:38:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.061 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Even though
most can be explained.

00:38:38.061 --> 00:38:39.650 align:middle line:90%
But it's important to share.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Number one.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And number two,
when you do share,

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and if you do seek some
guidance and help in a group,

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:50.260 align:middle line:84%
or from a professional, you
come full circle, to you,

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.690 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Ruth Hover mentions,
when somebody tells you

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.640 align:middle line:84%
their experience, it
tells more about them

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.380 align:middle line:84%
than it does about
the experience.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.182 align:middle line:84%
If they are a
frightened type person,

00:39:03.182 --> 00:39:04.640 align:middle line:84%
they are really
going to be scared.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.306 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:05.306 --> 00:39:07.747 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: If they are
an angry type person,

00:39:07.747 --> 00:39:09.830 align:middle line:84%
they're going to say, how
dare they do this to me.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:10.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:10.413 --> 00:39:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: But if you're open,
as I was, to the experience,

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.824 align:middle line:90%
it's a positive one.

00:39:16.824 --> 00:39:18.656 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That appears
to be the truth, yes.

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And even if
it wasn't at the time,

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.770 align:middle line:84%
just talking about
it, and ruminating,

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and learning, and putting
it in a proper perspective,

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.780 align:middle line:90%
it comes full circle.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And Doctor Mack was
talking about not only

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that positive aftereffect
that is finally reached

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.850 align:middle line:84%
with therapy, and
group, and so forth.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.844 align:middle line:84%
But also the
spiritual component.

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:41.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's really important.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:42.843 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Usually there's
quite an expansion

00:39:42.843 --> 00:39:45.377 align:middle line:84%
of awareness and consciousness
in these individuals.

00:39:45.377 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Absolutely.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And the more we learn
about it, and you

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:50.550 align:middle line:84%
don't have to have the
experience by the way, Regina,

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.210 align:middle line:84%
to have that positive
transformation.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.482 align:middle line:84%
If you open your heart and
your mind, and learn about it,

00:39:56.482 --> 00:39:58.440 align:middle line:84%
you can also have this
positive transformation.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And so now, now that you've
explained that so beautifully,

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to-- and I've
used the word twice already

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say it again-- the
extreme insult of taking

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:17.090 align:middle line:84%
these people, all these people's
experiences, and saying,

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:18.340 align:middle line:90%
you're silly.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.550 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.570 align:middle line:84%
It was a figment of
your imagination.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.370 align:middle line:90%
It was flares.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And essentially shaking
one's faith in one's

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:90%
own experience in life.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.180 align:middle line:90%
And this is done every day.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:90%
It's done by the news media.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.950 align:middle line:84%
It's done through the
public education system.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:84%
It's done in every way,
disconnecting people from what

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.850 align:middle line:84%
they feel is the truth, to
what the standardized version

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:46.020 align:middle line:84%
of "the truth" is
supposed to be.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Which of course, I think it's
damaged our psyche tremendously

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.150 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about Frances
Barwood, city councilwoman

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:56.440 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Lots of inquiries began
flowing into her office.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.050 align:middle line:90%
What was this that we saw?

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Can you give any kind
of official explanation

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.100 align:middle line:90%
as our city elders?

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Absolutely.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
Frances took it on.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.050 align:middle line:84%
She was open-minded
and took it on.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:15.565 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this would be a really
good time, let's take a listen.

00:41:15.565 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:84%
If you don't mind, we
lifted that part off

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.090 align:middle line:84%
of your DVD to show
what her experience was

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.580 align:middle line:84%
in trying to respond to
these genuine requests

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.697 align:middle line:90%
of the experiencers.

00:41:24.697 --> 00:41:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.270 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:27.644 align:middle line:10%
-As I was going
into the meeting,

00:41:27.644 --> 00:41:30.550 align:middle line:10%
I was stopped by
a reporter and she

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:34.710 align:middle line:10%
had with her a TV cameraman
and a microphone man.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.320 align:middle line:10%
And they started asking
me about these lights that

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.920 align:middle line:10%
went over Phoenix.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.750 align:middle line:10%
And I thought something
had just happened

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.430 align:middle line:10%
and I said, when
did this happen?

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:45.800 align:middle line:10%
And she said well, it
was actually March 13th.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said we
asked the city what

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.280 align:middle line:84%
it was, if they could
find out, and the answer

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:84%
from the mayor's office was, we
don't have UFOs over Phoenix.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was
a pretty strange thing

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.720 align:middle line:84%
being that nobody had
said it was a UFO.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.360 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted to
find out what it was.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.300 align:middle line:10%
So I went into the
meeting and came my turn,

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.584 align:middle line:10%
and I said there
was a report outside

00:42:09.584 --> 00:42:11.750 align:middle line:10%
and had asked some questions
about these lights that

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.670 align:middle line:10%
went over Phoenix
last March 13th,

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:18.360 align:middle line:10%
and could we find
out what it was?

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.530 align:middle line:10%
-And she thought it was a
fair question was asked of her

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:10%
and she wanted to know herself,
and she asked the question

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:29.020 align:middle line:10%
in chambers and got quite
an interesting reaction.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.270 align:middle line:84%
-Everybody just kind of
turned around and looked at me

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:35.080 align:middle line:90%
like why did you ask that?

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was like this
silence, and I-- and I

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.710 align:middle line:90%
felt kind of uneasy.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody-- one
of the other council

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
members, made some kind of
a joke and they went on.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.090 align:middle line:84%
They didn't assign
me two staff members.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:51.060 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say who was
going to look into it.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.540 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say who was
going to get back to me.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was really unusual.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:03.110 align:middle line:84%
After the meeting was over, one
of the assistant city managers

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.140 align:middle line:84%
came up to me and
said, you shouldn't

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.130 align:middle line:90%
have asked that question.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first
I heard about it.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nothing else was ever
discussed with me at any point.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.008 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
because it's something

00:43:15.008 --> 00:43:16.602 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
want to deal with.

00:43:16.602 --> 00:43:17.810 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.914 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
the mayor's office

00:43:19.914 --> 00:43:22.080 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to have to make
any kind of a statement.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.600 align:middle line:84%
They already issued
a statement and just

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.520 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to
have to go into it.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this
was so unusual.

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:31.310 align:middle line:10%
Something flies
over our airspace,

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.940 align:middle line:10%
flies over our
airport's air space,

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:39.400 align:middle line:10%
is seen by pilots
and flight crew

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.060 align:middle line:10%
and tower crew and
everything, and they

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.190 align:middle line:10%
are afraid for me to
bring up this question.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.540 align:middle line:10%
You know, when this
all started, the reason

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:10%
that I asked the question
about this incident that

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.050 align:middle line:10%
happened on March
13, 1997, which

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:59.410 align:middle line:10%
has come to be known
as the Phoenix Lights,

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:02.970 align:middle line:10%
was because I thought this
is a public safety issue

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:06.380 align:middle line:10%
and we need to know whatever
it was in case it comes back,

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.010 align:middle line:10%
in case it happens
again, or in case there's

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:10%
a danger to the people
or buildings or whatever

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:16.220 align:middle line:10%
because we have
antennas that are high.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't understand
the negative reaction

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:22.660 align:middle line:84%
that I got for asking this
when I thought it was,

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.270 align:middle line:84%
to me, a perfectly
innocent question.

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:29.620 align:middle line:84%
-Well, as she was pilloried
in the press and made fun of,

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.960 align:middle line:84%
the positive effect, however,
was that hundreds of people

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.955 align:middle line:84%
came out of the woodwork
and made phone calls

00:44:35.955 --> 00:44:37.470 align:middle line:90%
to her office and her home.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.730 align:middle line:84%
-My answering machine at
work totally filled up.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.094 align:middle line:84%
Since they couldn't get any
more calls into my office,

00:44:44.094 --> 00:44:45.510 align:middle line:84%
they started calling
other council

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:47.437 align:middle line:84%
members' office leaving
messages for me.

00:44:47.437 --> 00:44:48.270 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So what's
fascinating about that

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:52.260 align:middle line:10%
is she went on to say
something, and I'm picking it up

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.509 align:middle line:10%
because we can't run your
whole documentary right now,

00:44:54.509 --> 00:44:57.100 align:middle line:10%
I encourage people
to buy it though.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.890 align:middle line:84%
She went on to call
back I think 700

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.600 align:middle line:90%
of the people that called her.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.380 align:middle line:84%
She was so diligent
in her desire

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to sort this out she personally
called all of these people

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:09.720 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And what startled
her was she kept

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.790 align:middle line:84%
getting the same story,
the consistency of how

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:20.280 align:middle line:84%
the event appeared, how it felt,
how people felt while it was

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.870 align:middle line:84%
happening, all of this was
very consistent among these 700

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:26.550 align:middle line:84%
people that she returned
the phone calls to.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So again, you know,
she-- and look

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.937 align:middle line:84%
at the way she was treated as
a result of her participation.

00:45:32.937 --> 00:45:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Absolutely.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:38.810 align:middle line:84%
She's the only official,
government official,

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.405 align:middle line:84%
who came forward to even
inquire and she didn't see it.

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.390 align:middle line:84%
It was just because
so many constituents

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:44.567 align:middle line:90%
had contacted her--

00:45:44.567 --> 00:45:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: -that in good
faith she was doing her job.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: She mentioned, as
was seen in a council meeting,

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.632 align:middle line:90%
and just plastered to the wall.

00:45:51.632 --> 00:45:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I stayed anonymous for
seven years, by the way.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know you did.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And I was
very happy that I did.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
wanted to make sure

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.248 align:middle line:84%
that you had all
the facts straight

00:45:57.248 --> 00:45:58.920 align:middle line:84%
before you came
forward, didn't want

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.220 align:middle line:84%
to ruin your own reputation,
which I totally understand.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.224 align:middle line:84%
And this woman took
it on like you did.

00:46:04.224 --> 00:46:05.140 align:middle line:90%
She really took it on.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: She did.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting
two women take it on,

00:46:07.395 --> 00:46:08.960 align:middle line:90%
and Symington meanwhile.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Now let's finish up that
little story of Symington.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So not only did they ridicule
her and essentially discredit,

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.490 align:middle line:84%
or tried to discredit,
the feelings

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:84%
people had about the experience,
but Fife Symington himself

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:26.450 align:middle line:84%
ultimately came out
and made a comment.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I think he was regretful
for what he had done.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:31.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just a little clip.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:32.402 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:32.402 --> 00:46:53.760 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.860 align:middle line:90%
-It was all too symmetrical.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.309 align:middle line:84%
You can't control
flares that way.

00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:58.850 align:middle line:10%
There's just no way
they were flares.

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.130 align:middle line:10%
It was so
technologically advanced

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:04.120 align:middle line:10%
that it was a thrilling
feeling to see it.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.180 align:middle line:10%
The lights were
really brilliant,

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.630 align:middle line:10%
and it was just fascinating.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was enormous.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.670 align:middle line:90%
It just felt otherworldly.

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:16.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, in your gut, you
could tell it was otherworldly.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It has never been
identified to this day.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that unless the
Defense Department proves us

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.200 align:middle line:84%
otherwise, that it
was probably some form

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.486 align:middle line:90%
of an alien spacecraft.

00:47:27.486 --> 00:47:34.108 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.108 --> 00:47:35.070 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Yeah.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.416 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting how
this whole thing played out.

00:47:39.416 --> 00:47:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the puzzle
pieces fitting together--

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:43.706 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what's
so beautiful about it.

00:47:43.706 --> 00:47:46.070 align:middle line:84%
It's all there and you
documented all of this.

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:47.349 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: I tried.

00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
doesn't normally happen.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
UFO sightings almost

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.569 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis planetarily.

00:47:54.569 --> 00:47:56.110 align:middle line:84%
There are always
sightings happening.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Absolutely.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I wanted
to-- there's another one,

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I just love the work
of Martyn Stubbs.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, Martyn Stubbs,
and you have some

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.580 align:middle line:10%
of his video in
the documentary, he

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.760 align:middle line:10%
is the one that did the
video called "The Secret NASA

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.870 align:middle line:10%
Transmissions."

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:16.150 align:middle line:10%
And what happened was Martyn
was the manager, as I recall,

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:19.050 align:middle line:10%
I think in Vancouver, of
a public access television

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:22.760 align:middle line:10%
station and for some reason,
when he was running his feeds,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.990 align:middle line:10%
he somehow hooked
into the frequency

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:27.740 align:middle line:10%
of NASA's transmissions
because everything going on

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.974 align:middle line:10%
up in those space capsules
are being recorded.

00:48:29.974 --> 00:48:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Everything's being recorded.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Yes.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was getting the
live feed and broadcasting it.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And normally, humans
don't see that.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.140 align:middle line:10%
The public never
sees the live feed.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:40.650 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:10%
The public sees the
cleansed feed, and only

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.680 align:middle line:10%
tiny little portions.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.750 align:middle line:90%
These orbs darting all about.

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, something
intelligent going on out there.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Well, there's been a
number of videos that have been

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:57.400 align:middle line:84%
captured serendipitously
also that show--

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.100 align:middle line:84%
there's one that shows three
orbs coming together in a V

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.880 align:middle line:84%
formation exactly
like my video--

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:02.505 --> 00:49:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: -from March 13, 1997.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And as in this one
that shows something

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.690 align:middle line:84%
very similar to
the Dropa Stones.

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I examined the most credible
cases that I could find,

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and one of them was the
story of these Dropa Stones

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.449 align:middle line:84%
that were actually found
in China that were--

00:49:19.449 --> 00:49:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain Dropa Stones.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: -like records.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.740 align:middle line:84%
When they tried
to translate them,

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:31.150 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to be from some
kind of an alien intelligence.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So there was so
much to the story.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And I actually ended up
with a 750 page journal

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:41.410 align:middle line:84%
seven years later
and decided that I,

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:44.510 align:middle line:84%
in good conscience being an
educator for 35 years, how

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.940 align:middle line:84%
could I stick it in a drawer;
condensed the best of what

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I had discovered looking for a
logical explanation to this day

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.840 align:middle line:84%
into the first
edition of the book.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.760 align:middle line:10%
And the third edition
just came out last year

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.040 align:middle line:10%
that has a new chapter on what's
happened since I came forward

00:49:59.040 --> 00:49:59.650 align:middle line:10%
in 2004.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:00.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, can
we talk about that?

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:01.120 align:middle line:10%
>>KITEI: Surely.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.995 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Let's go ahead
and talk about that.

00:50:02.995 --> 00:50:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: There's other
sightings, including

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:09.010 align:middle line:84%
similar sightings in
Illinois and in Texas,

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:12.180 align:middle line:84%
as well as Symington
coming forward right

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:15.210 align:middle line:84%
after the 10th anniversary,
which was very interesting.

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Symington did come forward
to say that he actually saw--

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, as we
just saw a bit ago, yeah.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.425 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: -that he actually
saw the phenomenon

00:50:23.425 --> 00:50:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and that it was
otherworldly, which you would

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:90%
you hear over and over again.

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And there is so
much more I'm also

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.880 align:middle line:84%
sharing for the first
time, data that I never

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.540 align:middle line:84%
thought that I would
share, including--

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which?

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Actually, a study
that was done by Navy Optical

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Physicist, Dr. Bruce Maccabee,
way back in '98 of my close

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:47.670 align:middle line:84%
sighting photographs that I
have not shared for over a dozen

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:48.370 align:middle line:90%
years, but--

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why didn't
you share them?

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.378 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Because
it was so bizarre.

00:50:51.378 --> 00:50:54.240 align:middle line:84%
He actually found and
discovered in my photographs,

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.610 align:middle line:84%
even though my husband and I
felt that the close sighting

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:00.530 align:middle line:84%
was only two three,
four minutes tops,

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:02.960 align:middle line:90%
the data speaks differently.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.170 align:middle line:84%
From the first picture to
the last picture, and all

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:06.586 align:middle line:84%
you need to do is
look at the data

00:51:06.586 --> 00:51:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and I have it posted on the
phoenixlights.net photo page,

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.520 align:middle line:84%
there are many more lights
in the first picture

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.880 align:middle line:84%
in the skyline that are
not on in the last picture.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:20.640 align:middle line:10%
And he analyzes really,
really meticulously to show

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.000 align:middle line:10%
the groups of lights that
were on in the first picture

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.510 align:middle line:10%
and off in the last and had
me do a little experiment.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.580 align:middle line:84%
To go out, try to
stand in the same spot

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:35.129 align:middle line:84%
that I was standing in '95, take
the skyline pictures one night

00:51:35.129 --> 00:51:36.920 align:middle line:84%
every hour, the next
night every half hour.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And I actually took
it every 15 minutes

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:40.999 align:middle line:84%
to show when these groups
of lights would go out.

00:51:40.999 --> 00:51:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, my husband called
me out of the bath.

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I usually take a bath between
7:00 and 8:00 in the evening,

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.980 align:middle line:84%
so let's be conservative
and say the starting point

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:48.920 align:middle line:90%
is 8 o'clock.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, the groups of lights
start going out at 9:00,

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:55.306 align:middle line:84%
and the last picture
is indicative of 10:30,

00:51:55.306 --> 00:51:55.894 align:middle line:90%
11 o'clock.

00:51:55.894 --> 00:51:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're talking
about missing time.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:59.184 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Well, at
the time, I had

00:51:59.184 --> 00:52:00.750 align:middle line:84%
no idea what he was
even getting at.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me if he
could present the case

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:09.500 align:middle line:84%
at the upcoming 1999 MUFON,
Mutual UFO Network, symposium

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.046 align:middle line:90%
in Washington DC.

00:52:11.046 --> 00:52:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I said as long as you
keep my name out of it.

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:13.960 align:middle line:90%
This is your baby.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I would have never
ever noticed this data.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But he was so meticulous in
his investigation of the data.

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And at the time,
he presented it as

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:27.870 align:middle line:84%
the first photographic evidence,
authenticated photographic

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:30.400 align:middle line:90%
evidence, ever of missing time.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, I could not wrap
my head around this.

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:34.800 align:middle line:84%
There's much more to the
story, I have to say,

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.330 align:middle line:84%
that is shared in the
book and the website.

00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:41.460 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting is the
reason I'm sharing it now is,

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.760 align:middle line:84%
again, I do not believe
in coincidence any longer.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.310 align:middle line:84%
If I have this data,
maybe it's important.

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's important,
number one.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Number two, quantum physics
and quantum mechanics

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:53.710 align:middle line:90%
is just starting to catch up.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:58.030 align:middle line:84%
We're quite primitive in
our science at this point.

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're now postulating
string theory, bubble theory,

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that there may be 10 or 11
different dimensions out there.

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that's the case, if
there's other times and spaces

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:11.360 align:middle line:84%
along with ours,
then why is it such a

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.310 align:middle line:84%
leap that there could
be other intelligences

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:17.970 align:middle line:84%
in those other times and
spaces that we get glimpses

00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:19.715 align:middle line:84%
of if we're open to
them or inviting it.

00:53:19.715 --> 00:53:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean to me, it's just
pure logic, of course.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: So that's why
I'm sharing it now.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.674 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually working on
a curriculum for young people

00:53:26.674 --> 00:53:27.950 align:middle line:90%
getting back to my passion--

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: I call
it Out Of The Box.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.409 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: For fall.

00:53:31.409 --> 00:53:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Fifth through 12th graders
on the whole unexplained

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:35.240 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon topic.

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.610 align:middle line:90%
They thirst for this knowledge.

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:39.869 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing, nothing in
our classrooms, especially

00:53:39.869 --> 00:53:40.660 align:middle line:90%
our history books--

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: -concerning this and
it's about time that there was.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, absolutely.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
there's a lot of evidence

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the
young people that

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.900 align:middle line:84%
are coming onto the
planet at this time

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.230 align:middle line:84%
are hard-wired to accept
these kinds of things.

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:58.190 align:middle line:84%
They are very
comfortable, have expanded

00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:01.300 align:middle line:84%
IQ over what we've seen
prior to this period of time,

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.320 align:middle line:84%
are highly intuitive
individuals.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So for them to resonate on
a higher, more refined level

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:10.920 align:middle line:84%
with this information, I totally
support what you're doing.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that's just fabulous
that you're now putting it out

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:17.550 align:middle line:84%
there in an arena that really,
because of the previous work

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:20.690 align:middle line:84%
you've done, you've got to
erase the giggle factor from it.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.515 align:middle line:84%
It's really not
part of it anymore.

00:54:22.515 --> 00:54:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And to let these kids start
exploring in their own right.

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Exactly.

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:27.208 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, one thing
you were talking about

00:54:27.208 --> 00:54:29.060 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago was the
multi-dimensionality.

00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I mean, I think it's
11 dimensions that they've

00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:36.670 align:middle line:84%
been able to identify up to
this point, something like that.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:39.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these sightings
that take place, just

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.420 align:middle line:84%
like you missed
a period of time.

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.770 align:middle line:84%
There was a phase shift in
the time space continuum,

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:49.550 align:middle line:84%
it appears, that felt like
two to four minutes to you.

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And so now that this
has been documented,

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:54.030 align:middle line:84%
you're more
comfortable with that.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.440 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
the notion of people

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:00.400 align:middle line:84%
being able to see into
other dimensional fields.

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.897 align:middle line:84%
And from that-- if I may
share something of my own.

00:55:02.897 --> 00:55:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Absolutely.

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had an experience
years ago as a journalist.

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I was looking to
do a documentary

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.300 align:middle line:84%
for PBS called "UFOs,
Hard Evidence."

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had attended the
Disclosure Project in DC,

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.650 align:middle line:90%
I was aware of Phoenix Lights.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I had done quite a bit
of study on this myself.

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And as part of my research,
I went out in the field

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.980 align:middle line:90%
with Steven Greer's group.

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you go out
and you watch the night sky.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But before that,
everybody gathers around

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and, not a campfire because
there's no light, right?

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Normally on a very dark
evening, you gather around

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and you take a moment to see
what comes up intuitively.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, you're looking
beyond the time space continuum

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:44.340 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing that and
things were popping up

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.900 align:middle line:84%
on schedule and all, but
one of the things that most

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:53.340 align:middle line:84%
got me was I kept
looking at-- each night,

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing this elliptical
blue spacecraft that

00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:02.220 align:middle line:84%
was sitting on a flat rock
at the edge of some crags.

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
just saw it again.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.540 align:middle line:90%
I must be making it up.

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not happened, so it
must not be happening.

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But the epilogue is the second
to the last day we went out

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:16.880 align:middle line:84%
to the crags in Joshua Tree,
and somebody had a digital cam

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and was taking photos.

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.700 align:middle line:84%
The next day when I came
in, everyone was abuzz.

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.900 align:middle line:84%
They were around a
television screen.

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, their
image, which was--

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:27.670 align:middle line:84%
they thought they had just
taken pictures of rocks,

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:29.770 align:middle line:84%
there was the elliptical
blue spacecraft

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:33.220 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the flat rock right
at the edge of the crags,

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:36.320 align:middle line:84%
as I had seen the day
before, the day before

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.520 align:middle line:90%
and the day before.

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So whether I was
being shown the future

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:42.560 align:middle line:84%
or whether I was simply dialing
into whatever was already

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.120 align:middle line:84%
there, the point was in
subsequent experiences,

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.670 align:middle line:90%
they were all over the place.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Mm-hm.

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
people-- that's

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.300 align:middle line:84%
why the internet now is so
glorious and social networking

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:58.980 align:middle line:84%
because before, as you said,
there could be ridicule,

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.450 align:middle line:84%
blowing it off, ignoring
the data, whatever.

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:03.350 align:middle line:90%
It can't be ignored any longer.

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.390 align:middle line:84%
There're too many
people worldwide

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:08.700 align:middle line:84%
who are becoming aware
that something is going on

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:11.790 align:middle line:84%
out of our own reality,
outside our own reality,

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and even alien to
our own reality

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:15.375 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be addressed.

00:57:15.375 --> 00:57:15.958 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:15.958 --> 00:57:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And they're
capturing these phenomenon.

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:21.415 align:middle line:84%
Most things can be
explained, but some cannot.

00:57:21.415 --> 00:57:25.037 align:middle line:84%
The small percentages that
cannot needs to be addressed

00:57:25.037 --> 00:57:25.620 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have to
begin trusting each other.

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the point
of this conversation,

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:31.780 align:middle line:84%
why I wanted to have
you on this show,

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:36.810 align:middle line:84%
is because we need to start
not only listening to ourselves

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and trusting in our
own perceptions.

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:40.935 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:57:40.935 --> 00:57:42.643 align:middle line:84%
That could have seemed
really wacky to me

00:57:42.643 --> 00:57:45.197 align:middle line:84%
to be seeing this thing and
not have any validation for it.

00:57:45.197 --> 00:57:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But sure enough,
there it was on film.

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.340 align:middle line:84%
It was validated, so it
all ended really nicely.

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The other things
that I saw behind us

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:53.380 align:middle line:84%
were never captured
on film, but does that

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.810 align:middle line:90%
mean they didn't exist?

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I got to a point
finally over the years

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.820 align:middle line:84%
where I decided I'm trusting
my own perceptions first,

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.060 align:middle line:84%
everything else, including
scientific data, comes second.

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And if we can all feel
comfortable enough

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:08.840 align:middle line:84%
to trust ourselves and share
that with other people,

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.750 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start seeing
really similar themes,

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:14.270 align:middle line:84%
just like the Phoenix
Lights, which is so beautiful

00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:16.047 align:middle line:84%
it allowed the
possibility for that,

00:58:16.047 --> 00:58:18.521 align:middle line:84%
for so many people to
have a common experience.

00:58:18.521 --> 00:58:20.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
that in many ways

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.337 align:middle line:90%
when people begin to speak up.

00:58:21.337 --> 00:58:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Absolutely.

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:23.294 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so important.

00:58:23.294 --> 00:58:25.780 align:middle line:84%
The more credible people
that do come forward.

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.655 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, having
a 35 millimeter camera

00:58:27.655 --> 00:58:28.660 align:middle line:90%
is the best way--

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: -to analyze
these things.

00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:31.540 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be here
if I didn't have

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.950 align:middle line:84%
that data to show
the hard evidence.

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll hear from
hard-line skeptics or debunkers

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:40.520 align:middle line:84%
who try to discredit the
messenger so people won't

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:42.990 align:middle line:84%
listen to the message,
look at the data.

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Look at the data.

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.165 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: It speaks for itself.

00:58:44.165 --> 00:58:45.123 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:58:45.123 --> 00:58:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So you've got data, you
have personal experience,

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.400 align:middle line:90%
you have feelings.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.610 align:middle line:90%
I want to ask you one thing.

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:52.330 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple
minutes left here.

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that
there was, whether you

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:58.060 align:middle line:84%
want to call it on a
soul level or whatnot,

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
reason for all of this?

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there had to have been.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Were you somehow
chosen on some level

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:07.759 align:middle line:84%
to be the one to
carry it forward?

00:59:07.759 --> 00:59:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel-- what do you feel?

00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just don't be shy, what
do you feel this was all about?

00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: Firstly, I
think that everyone

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:16.714 align:middle line:84%
is chosen to live a life
on this beautiful planet.

00:59:16.714 --> 00:59:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: And hopefully,
as people become awakened,

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.800 align:middle line:84%
they appreciate how
lucky we are to have

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.630 align:middle line:84%
the experience on this
beautiful, wonderful planet.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's also our own choice of
what we do with an experience

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and what we do with
what comes before us.

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:37.087 align:middle line:84%
And it was my choice to
actually delve into this.

00:59:37.087 --> 00:59:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I could have very
easily blown it off.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.090 align:middle line:90%
My husband did.

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:45.150 align:middle line:84%
He knows we saw something
unusual and not of our world.

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But I chose maybe from my past
experience and my dear death

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.850 align:middle line:84%
experience as a child,
just having the foundation

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:54.840 align:middle line:90%
laid at that point.

00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:57.298 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a very interesting
story in and of itself that

00:59:57.298 --> 01:00:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I share now in the book,
or the scientist in me.

01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have really tried to
be as scientific as possible

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:06.310 align:middle line:84%
to have these phenomenon
explained to me.

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:08.790 align:middle line:90%
And to this day, no one can.

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And having a whole new
world that I never knew

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:17.270 align:middle line:84%
existed 15 years
ago opened up to me

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and feeling compelled
to share it.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And if people-- and as I
mentioned, people that do

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.210 align:middle line:84%
have experiences, unexplained
phenomenon experiences,

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just
aerial phenomena,

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
wakes us up not only to the
spiritual beings we are,

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:33.770 align:middle line:84%
but the potential, the
positive potential.

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:36.190 align:middle line:84%
We have so much more potential
than we're being told--

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: -to make this
world a better world.

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And whether
you were chosen

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:41.040 align:middle line:84%
or whether you simply
made the choice

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.040 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make a difference.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: It does not.

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.570 align:middle line:90%
In the end--

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: We all choose what
to do with our own life--

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I thank you
for making that choice--

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KITEI: -and what
comes before us.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -on behalf of
everybody watching this.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Thank you.

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:51.688 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That you have made
it comfortable for more people

01:00:51.688 --> 01:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to explore this subject than
has ever been the case before.

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: I hope so.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.590 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, thank you.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KITEI: Keep looking up.
