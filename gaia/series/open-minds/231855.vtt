00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Do you
believe you're brainwashed?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:10%
Most of us would say
no, but we might want

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:10%
to take another look at that.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:84%
RJ Spina is here
with us today to talk

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of how our
mind takes in impressions

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and information and what
constitutes brainwashing and so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:90%
much more.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:84%
We're even going into real
manifestation, et cetera.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Very misunderstood subjects
and what I love about you,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.000 align:middle line:84%
RJ, welcome, it's the first
time I've had you here,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:84%
is that you truly
understand the nature

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:90%
of the architecture of mind.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't it be nice if we
had a manual, a user's guide

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
to the mind starting
in kindergarten?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> RJ SPINA: By the way.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:90%
It would be very helpful.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:10%
That was really the crux of
the second book, Change Your

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:10%
Mind which is--

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I love that book.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.623 align:middle line:10%
>> SPINA: Thank you.

00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:10%
It's actually a user manual
and step-by-step process

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:10%
of deprogramming the
limiting beliefs,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:10%
actually seeing what they
are, and then actually imbuing

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:10%
your life and creating your life
from what is germane to you.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.385 align:middle line:84%
And most of us think we're
doing that, but we're not.

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time
when you weren't either.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead
and let people get

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
to know you a little bit
through your backstory,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's really
quite extraordinary.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you use the power of
mind, the nature of your being

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
came to do this, because you
have to have a good party trick

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:90%
to get people to pay attention.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it took you to
the doorstep of death.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
It took the party trick as
far as it could go, really.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about what happened to you.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:10%
So this was-- to be exact,
it was April 23, 2016.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.222 align:middle line:10%
I had been sick
for a few months.

00:01:52.222 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:10%
I'd been in the hospital
for a couple of weeks.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But on April 23, that
day, I became permanently,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:84%
air quotes, permanently
paralyzed from the chest down.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
several illnesses.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's
autoimmune disease,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:90%
pancreatitis, thyroiditis.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I was suffering from
autonomic dysreflexia,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
for those that know, are
paraplegic or a quadriplegic.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Autonomic system
is what regulates

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:84%
your heartbeat, your blood
pressure, your breathing,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:90%
your temperature.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Mine didn't work anymore.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what keeps you alive.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Literally.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Literally.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:90%
So I had emergency surgery.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I had an infection.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
You got an infection,
and everything just

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:90%
started tumbling from there.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:90%
One thing affecting another?

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: No.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:90%
It was immediate.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I was sick for a while.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: But then
everything shut off.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And I actually felt it
shut off the sensation

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.792 align:middle line:90%
from my chest down.

00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I was immediately
rushed to the hospital.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:84%
They performed a surgery
called the laminectomy, which

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:84%
is where they shave off some
of the spine, the vertebrae,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and then scrape off
this huge infection that

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:84%
was covering from
T5 to T10, that

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:90%
was predominantly T7 and T8.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And there's an MRI of this.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually see
what my spine looks like.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:90%
It was crushed.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:90%
It was paper thin.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:90%
So they performed this surgery.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.266 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up from
surgery, as you know,

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in an
enlightened state.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I started explaining how I
would heal myself and so on,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and we'll get into that.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But I was told,
you cannot recover.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
The damage to your
spine is so severe.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you can do.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And all these diseases that you
have, these chronic conditions,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing you
can do about them.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
You'll be on medication
the rest of your life,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.173 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be in a wheelchair
for the rest of your life.

00:03:31.173 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, the other
aspect of mind kicks in.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.047 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, you had this
enlightened moment or more.

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what happened after you

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:90%
were told that diagnosis.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: Well, this even
talks about the brainwashing.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So if I would have
listened to everybody,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I would have never even
attempted to heal myself.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: To overcome permanent
paralysis and all these

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:90%
diseases.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
doctor knows best.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Correct.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.303 align:middle line:84%
The white coat, the authority,
and by the way, you're all down

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're standing over
you, talking you down to you.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.535 align:middle line:84%
So I knew what I
knew inside deeply.

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't matter what
someone was saying to me.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.243 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter what kind of
authority figure that they were.

00:04:09.243 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to let their
opinion create the life that I

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:90%
was going to build for myself.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the opposite
of what brainwashing is.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
I knew in that moment
that I would heal myself.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I know that
I would heal myself,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I knew the specifics
of what to do it,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:84%
which makes up the
crux of the first book.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: So the next 100
days were spent literally,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and this is all filmed
and all documented,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:90%
un-paralyzing myself.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Video, taking of it.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I have interviews with
doctors, neurosurgeons.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
When we take control
of our mind completely,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.815 align:middle line:84%
there's absolutely
nothing we can't do.

00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing
to learn about that

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
is that you can't take in
someone else's opinion,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.978 align:middle line:84%
because someone else's opinion
has nothing to do with you.

00:04:54.978 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're all
doing that all the time.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've been doing
that for lifetimes.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And that information is stored
within our subconscious, that

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:84%
is constantly chatting
with us and helping

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:90%
us react to everything.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're so
darn reactive in life.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even know why
we're reacting anymore.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
talk about all that.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But you said you were
going to heal and walk out

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:90%
of there in 100 days.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:90%
And you did.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Mhm.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:90%
And filmed it.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.642 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And filmed it.

00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to know, the part

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
of the story of what those
doctors that diagnosed you

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:90%
experienced as you kept healing.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: The very beginning,
the first 17 days of it,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:90%
there was nothing.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And the neurosurgeon
stopped coming around

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
because he would come in, touch
my toes, Mr. Spina, can you--

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Nothing happening.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't feel anything either.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.755 align:middle line:84%
So at that point--
and he told me

00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
there's no way to
recover from this damage.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:90%
So he stopped showing.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But it was on day 17
in the rehab facility,

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and I started kicking
my leg up and down.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And after that, the healing
was not linear in any way.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
It was what we could call
quantum, if you want.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle line:84%
At certain points over
the next roughly 83 days,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I started doing things
that the day before, I

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.622 align:middle line:84%
showed no signs or ability
to be able to do so.

00:06:11.622 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Its function
came back online again?

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.288 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: It was
back, like completely.

00:06:15.288 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how is he
kicking his legs completely?

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, he couldn't
move his other leg.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Couldn't
feel his toe.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Right.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So this all has to do with
listening to myself completely

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and utterly and shutting
everything else out.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And the instructions
on how to do it

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:84%
is actually in the
healing technique

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
that I remembered when
I woke up from surgery.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And since that book's come
out, there's tens of thousands

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.535 align:middle line:84%
of people have helped
themselves in ways

00:06:38.535 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
with their mental, emotional,
and physical health in ways

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that they have been trying their
entire life that they weren't

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:90%
able to do.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.407 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're able
to do it because they're

00:06:46.407 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:84%
calling upon something
within themselves

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
calling upon before,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're realizing
what they're calling

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:90%
upon doesn't have a limitation.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything else; the belief
systems, the ideologies,

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
the concepts, the information,
all contextual and all

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
relating to something
else, this is

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:84%
the unlimited nature of the
fractal of God, of what we are.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And when tapped in,
we can do anything.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's take the
old axiom mind over matter

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and expand and refine that
considerably in terms of talking

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
about the nature
of how mind works.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.238 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:90%
You started talking about this.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about
the subconscious.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So everything we ever hear,
everything that we ever see,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:84%
it gets buried within
our subconscious mind.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind
is responsible for 95%

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:90%
of our reality creation.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is our thinking mind

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
has almost no effect on the life
that we build for ourselves,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
because the subconscious
is imbuing all the thought

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:90%
processes to begin with.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So you only think
about the things

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:90%
that we have been programmed by.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mhm.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Over many, many, many lifetimes.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Many lifetimes.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:90%
It's buried within us.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
It's also in our
subtle body of energy.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Our physical body is
about 30% of what we are.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:84%
When we can see
with true sight, we

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.650 align:middle line:84%
would see a much
larger body of energy.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of these indentations
and identifications

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
are buried within the
subtle body of energy.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
It's buried within the
subconscious, which

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
imbues and actually controls
the thinking mind, which means,

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:84%
humanity has been limited
severely for eons of time.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And until we start to go
in, deprogram, and remove,

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
we don't gain what it is
that we can actually do.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:90%
This is the birth of Superman.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: If you ask me, this is
the birth of Superman when we do

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:90%
it right.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So for now,
most of us are basically--

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.772 align:middle line:84%
we're not responding to life and
we're not creating our lives,

00:08:38.772 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:90%
even for the most part.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.272 align:middle line:84%
We are reacting
because of stimuli

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
that have happened, who
knows when it happened,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
to something that feels somewhat
similar in this time frame,

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
or someone who looks
somewhat similar to someone

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.287 align:middle line:84%
we reacted to maybe
lifetimes ago.

00:08:53.287 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet you have
feelings that well up

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:90%
and you start reacting to them.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we're living.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:90%
We're living reactionary lives.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: That's exactly right.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.988 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
reacting, that means

00:09:02.988 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:84%
there's something there
that's already programmed

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:90%
because you're reacting.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So when we get triggered,
getting triggered,

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
this automatic
reaction state, the key

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:90%
is to go into the trigger.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Because a trigger
is a collapsing

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and a
constriction of energy.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you can go into
where the trigger is,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.310 align:middle line:84%
realize what it is, the
exponential growth in terms

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
of no longer
reacting, and now we

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
can respond in a
completely different way,

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
create a completely
different life,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
recognizing the trigger

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
what it actually is.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Not getting upset at the person
who said this or did this,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
but going deep within
yourself, understanding

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
why do I feel this way and
why do I think this way.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And start to uncover the
beliefs, the concepts,

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:84%
the ideologies that we
are aligning ourselves

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.350 align:middle line:84%
with that we're unaware
of because we never

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:90%
ask these questions.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're right.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: Until we do
that, we'll only react like

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:90%
in a program.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to change
our life, we can't react.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:84%
We have to respond from a
place of new possibilities

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.770 align:middle line:84%
that are outside of the
programs of the subconscious

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:90%
patterned egoic mind.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.278 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
have to have love and respect

00:10:16.278 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
for the subconscious,
which carries forward

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
from lifetime to lifetime,
just like our mind.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're paired.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:90%
This comes for a reason.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's important.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give the
subconscious its due to say,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:90%
it is there for our survival.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
You've been stung by
this before, you've

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:90%
eaten that before.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:90%
You died.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's there to just give you
the warning signs of the things

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that hurt you, harmed you,
traumatized you in the past,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:90%
and some of the good stuff, too.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.763 align:middle line:90%
There is some juice in there.

00:10:42.763 --> 00:10:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you're drawn
to the same thing

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
over and over due to
a pleasure response

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.890 align:middle line:90%
coming from the subconscious.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But by and large,
it's there to help

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:84%
us basically stay embodied
in the physical world,

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't you say?

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Without question.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.063 align:middle line:84%
Wait until we discover that
the subconscious is actually

00:10:57.063 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:90%
where the Akashic actually is.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to totally go off
this script and go on to--

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
let's follow where you just were
until we actually analyze this.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, you were born wired to
do your due diligence all

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
the way through, when it
comes to understanding

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.170 align:middle line:84%
the nature of mind and
its effect on our reality,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:90%
our physical world.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So you decided to do an
experiment at one point

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:84%
where everything that
you felt and did,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:84%
you were going to
write down, and then

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
you were going to ask
yourself questions about it.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Write down to, well, why
am I combing my hair?

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
how far you went

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:84%
in terms of trying to
understand and then reprogram

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious with these
exercises, just for now.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I feel like, Regina, I
went as far as I could go.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
just what you said.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing I was
doing, I was writing down

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and I would ask myself the
question, why am I doing it.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered is
that the first answer to

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.002 align:middle line:90%
was a justification.

00:11:55.002 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Like, why am I brushing my hair?

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a mess.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.890 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:84%
But that's not my
core motivation.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.490 align:middle line:90%
My hair is probably a mess.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:90%
My core motive--

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: What is
my core motivation?

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
What I found out
is that the core

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.470 align:middle line:84%
of why I was brushing my
hair, the real reason why

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I was doing it, is because
I get a sense of self

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:84%
from other people's
opinion of me.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, that has nothing
to do with the real me.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
That has to do with everything
being focused outward.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
at that moment,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I just
discovered something

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
so profound that here's
an activity that I

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
do over and over again, and
I never really understood

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:90%
why I was doing it.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.098 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: And the
truth of the matter is,

00:12:36.098 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
it had everything to
do with everybody else,

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and it had nothing
to do with me.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
mean about discovering,

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
when is it going
to be your life?

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
The only time it's your life
is when you discover everything

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing
that isn't germane,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.455 align:middle line:90%
is it not coming from you.

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's not coming from
your soul, higher mind impulse.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: That's it.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's the reactionary.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.137 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: This is
when we lead our life,

00:12:56.137 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and it feels empty
and it feels hollow.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And even when we achieve a goal
that we've been working for

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
so long and so on and we
finally get it, and we're like,

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of empty.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Is that all there is?

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: That's because that
dream didn't come from you.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:84%
That dream came from mom, dad,
society, clergy, the internet,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why it was completely
and utterly unfulfilling.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It didn't really come from you.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And we can't change that until
we understand and discover

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
everything that we're doing
that doesn't come from us.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to do that is
to ask, why am I doing this?

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Why do I feel this way?

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:90%
You get to the core motivation.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to
discover, believe it or not,

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
we're going to discover that
roughly, 99.9% of everything

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:90%
that we do is a program.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't come from us.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
We are not in tune
with who we are.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
We're not leading the life that
we know that we're capable of.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
We're not experiencing
joy, happiness, meaning,

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:90%
fulfillment every moment.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
we're doing is to serve

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:90%
something and someone else.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
birth of Superman.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Once we start to understand
this and remove the programs,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.812 align:middle line:84%
take out the garbage,
as I like to say,

00:14:11.812 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:84%
once we take out
the garbage, we're

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:90%
going to realize what's inside.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's whole, complete, full.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Everything is within us.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Our ultimate sense of self and
what it is that we can create

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.570 align:middle line:90%
is what we are.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But until we stop
running programs

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and until we start addressing
it, it can't happen.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:90%
We recycle experiences.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:84%
This even relates
to civilizations.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:84%
The building, and the
crumbling of civilizations.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
This even relates
to incarnations.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Having incarnations
and they're over,

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and we never actually became
self-realized and enlightened.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't really realize
what we're actually capable of.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind
is the treasure chest.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: It absolutely
the treasure chest.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.308 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: And hopefully that
second book, Change Your Mind,

00:14:56.308 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:84%
what I talk about is the
treasure map as how to get

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:90%
to the treasure chest.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:90%
So here we are now.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
is happening right now

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
at this period in history, that
we are having the opportunity

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
to-- grasp the opportunity to
be able to become sovereign

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:84%
once again, because we
haven't been for so long?

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:84%
It's so if we think
of consciousness,

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:90%
kind of going in cycles.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And I always use the
analogy of like a flower.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So a flower comes up and
then finally fully blooms.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.910 align:middle line:84%
But then it undergoes
the same process.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is at this moment where
we're just starting to do this.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So the only way to fully
bloom, the only way

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to actually become
who and what--

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the only way for the caterpillar
to become the butterfly

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the old ways of
being must be destroyed.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And they are.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: And those old ways of
being have to do with the belief

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.738 align:middle line:84%
system, the concepts, the
ideologies of leading a life

00:15:58.738 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
that has nothing to do with
who and what we really are.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
We're at a critical
moment in the evolution

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness, that
we can no longer evolve ourself

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:90%
through beliefs.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Through anything outside of it.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It must be tangible,
felt-sense, and experiential.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:90%
That is the only way.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't evolve
your consciousness

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:90%
through things like beliefs.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And beliefs for me,
metaphysically, by definition,

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
are disempowering because any
belief always has its landing

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:90%
spot outside of yourself.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, I believe
in a heaven out there.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing outside
of our consciousness.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.020 align:middle line:90%
God is within our consciousness.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So by operating with beliefs,
the evolution and the evolution

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness ceases.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And what we get is a
repeat of civilizations

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.665 align:middle line:84%
that don't come into a full
state of enlightenment.

00:16:54.665 --> 00:16:55.465 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:55.465 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: And that's actually
what we're seeing right now.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Right now, that's
what we're seeing.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.700 align:middle line:84%
This clamping down by fostering
more and more information

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.579 align:middle line:84%
to program, so we
never go within

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:84%
and realize what it is that
you and I are talking about.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.974 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Attempting
to keep the bud closed.

00:17:07.974 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's struggling to open.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to open--

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: You got it.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.702 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --in all of
us, because the prevailing

00:17:12.702 --> 00:17:15.100 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is demanding
that our little buds open.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which means you got
that light and dark fight going

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.820 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Our viewers know about that.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.825 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
you just mentioned

00:17:21.825 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
is, by going with these
beliefs and programs,

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
depending on the society and
time you've been born into,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:90%
they're very limited.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what
society and community can

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:84%
look like when all those
restrictions are taken off

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and people begin to
go into communion.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Talk about how
they get there too,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
with higher mind, which
translates for the soul, which

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:90%
is here for a reason.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
It came to learn and express
things and experience things,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and we don't even get to
touch it because of this.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.320 align:middle line:90%
So I know I opened up a lot.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.986 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:53.986 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: So there's
a really fast, simple,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and tangible way to put
ourselves at the absolute

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:90%
starting line of that.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.668 align:middle line:84%
And it's so simple, it boggles
the lower consciousness

00:18:07.668 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
because the lower consciousness
complicates everything,

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:90%
because it dissects everything.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of the
matter is, if we simply

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
pretend that we just arrived
here, no past, no future.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.635 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mhm.

00:18:18.635 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: If we just
get here now, now,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:84%
we can actually operate
from a limitless sense.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Because if we rely on
the past, the future

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:90%
is already created for us.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to create from
a place of infinite potential.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.520 align:middle line:84%
We literally have to pretend
that we just arrived here.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.025 align:middle line:90%
No past and no future.

00:18:38.025 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, when
you're talking and saying that,

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.942 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what's going on
in my head when I'm seeing, OK,

00:18:42.942 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
so I just landed here and I'm
fascinated with butterflies,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and I say, I'm going to
make butterfly dresses.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to do.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I want to dress myself
and others so we

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:90%
can look like butterflies.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:90%
It sounds silly.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is,
why the heck not?

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Well, yeah.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.007 align:middle line:90%
If it's coming from--

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: From you.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.333 align:middle line:90%
From pure inspiration and joy.

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: That's what
I'm talking about.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:84%
You're not basing upon what
you can do based upon a past.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Like what's possible?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Anything is possible.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: That's what I mean.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.160 align:middle line:90%
The superhuman comes from that.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to create an
enlightened civilization

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:90%
will come from what I just said.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
If it's based upon
a past, the future

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:84%
is already dictated because
it's based upon a past.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It's limited.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely limited.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:84%
From the space of infinite
potential and infinite

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
possibilities is
actually our destiny

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to become self-realized
enlightened

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and create an
enlightened society.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.537 align:middle line:90%
It can't be based upon the past.

00:19:38.537 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
It has to be based upon
unlimited potential, which

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:90%
is available in every moment.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It does.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And see now, a lot of
people would argue with you

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and then say, OK.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:90%
But how does society function?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to fix the plumbing?

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.032 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are people
that love problem solving.

00:19:53.032 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
There are people that
love looking at how

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:84%
that all works
and ties together,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and how you clear it out and
make everything flow again.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
That's part of a desire of
some humans to know that

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and to do that and
to express that.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think the notion that
just because something

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:84%
might be challenging for another
person means nobody wants

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.366 align:middle line:90%
to do it, that's not true.

00:20:13.366 --> 00:20:14.166 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Exactly.

00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And also, the first thing
that we don't want to do

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
is rush to things
how, when, why.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: So we want to
eliminate these words that

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:90%
stifle creativity.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the lower
consciousness immediately

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:84%
goes to something to grasp
at a sense of security.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, how am I going to do that?

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
The lower consciousness does
that because it's disconnected

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:90%
from the source of knowing.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
trying to survive.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: It doesn't
know anything.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.342 align:middle line:84%
So it's always
looking for direction.

00:20:40.342 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as we get the how,
the when, the why, the trying,

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
that is when the
lower consciousness

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:90%
has taken over the higher mind.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So we want to leave
that to the side

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and let the creativity
start to come through,

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
because in the
strangest sense, the how

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:90%
is none of your business.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Let the universe
start to coalesce.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: This has to
do with manifestation.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.175 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to get into that.

00:21:02.175 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:84%
We have like five hours
of topics to crunch

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.900 align:middle line:90%
into 45 minutes, but go ahead.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is
vibrate in a certain way.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:90%
We have to embody that.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.823 align:middle line:84%
And then the energies,
starting with our body--

00:21:14.823 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:84%
our physical body of energy
and our subtle body of energy,

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.823 align:middle line:84%
and this is part of
how healing works,

00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:84%
we'll start to adhere itself
and mold itself to the frequency

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:90%
that you're emanating.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So the how and all these kind
of things start to coalesce.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.380 align:middle line:84%
They start to come into fruition
without you focusing on them.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
The focus is on embodying
and the creation.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything else will
start to come into play.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
If we start putting our focus on
outside of ourself with the how,

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:84%
we lose the power
and the efficacy

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.230 align:middle line:90%
of maintaining that frequency.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.147 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:44.147 --> 00:21:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: That's what the
lower consciousness does.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:90%
How, when--

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
where humanity lives.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Correct.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.918 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're
trying to bust out of that

00:21:50.918 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:90%
because it's time.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So there are words that
are really important that

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:84%
need to be tossed in there,
which is joy and desire.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So just like a silly little
example, if you've just

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:90%
arrived on the planet, wow.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Butterfly.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Pretty.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:90%
I want to do that.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:84%
If we could, for
ourselves in a meditation,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.340 align:middle line:84%
even, just set ourselves aside
and imagine that very thing you

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.940 align:middle line:84%
said, that could be
very helpful in seeing

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:84%
what it is that just
brings joy to us by walking

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:90%
through the world.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And that would start giving
us a clue to who we truly are.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: 100%.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
to demystify what

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
things like enlightenment and
self-realization, which they're

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.240 align:middle line:90%
actually the same thing.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And enlightenment
and self-realization

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.820 align:middle line:84%
is direct communion
with your higher self.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, you know who
you are, where you come from,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and you have access
to that entire body

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:90%
of energy and consciousness.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.458 align:middle line:84%
You know about your
past lives, you

00:22:42.458 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
know about so-called
future lives.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:90%
You're in full communion.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And the underlying energy
behind that is a state of joy.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolute joy.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I think enlightenment
has become conceptualized

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and theorized, Regina.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's become a burden.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.897 align:middle line:84%
Trying to seek it is
almost a burden for people.

00:23:01.897 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: A burden itself.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: What we're going to
realize is that enlightenment is

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:90%
the letting go of everything.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not constructive.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:84%
You're not adding
on to anything that

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:90%
is already whole and complete.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.980 align:middle line:90%
The soul is whole and complete.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Adding on will only take away.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So enlightenment is actually
the removal of everything.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything falls away.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:84%
There was a moment
in the hospital

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.423 align:middle line:84%
where I was just sitting there,
wasn't trying to do anything.

00:23:28.423 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is when you
could or couldn't do anything.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: No.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:84%
This was like four
days after surgery.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:90%
Paralyzed from the chest down.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Body not working.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:10%
Can't feel it.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:10%
And I'm just sitting
there at peace.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:10%
And there was this moment.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's tangible.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I remember it like
it just happened.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.100 align:middle line:84%
There was this moment where all
knowledge, everything that we've

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.140 align:middle line:84%
been working towards
gaining and understanding

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:84%
of all this information,
spiritual otherwise

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.060 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter, knowledge.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And then ignorance,
the other side

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're always trying to
compensate for and fill up

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:84%
by acquiring knowledge, in this
one single moment, knowledge

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and ignorance were seen
as the exact same thing.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And they both fell away.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that remained
was total clarity and complete

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:84%
connection with
this knowingness,

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
this deep knowingness
of everything.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.060 align:middle line:90%
So it was the removal.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:90%
The dropping away.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is how I was
able to rebuild my body.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.420 align:middle line:84%
How I was able to
rebuild my life.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:84%
How I was able to create from
this space of infinite potential

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't trying
to adhere to knowledge.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't trying to
compensate for a lack of it

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.740 align:middle line:84%
because the self is
whole and complete.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And once we attune
body mind to the self,

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.740 align:middle line:90%
there is no limitation.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Joy, happiness, grace,
completeness, purpose,

00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:84%
fulfillment, compassion,
power, courageousness.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
It's all there, and it
just flows unabated.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:90%
You don't even have to try.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's so weird,
because we're, as a species,

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
in our evolutionary arc at
this moment, caught between--

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
we tend to, as humans
learn through pain,

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
but we're motivated by joy
and pleasure and desire.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.400 align:middle line:90%
That's what pulls us forward.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.340 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like to have
a hammer over the head

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
to let go of the things
that don't work, i.e., pain.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So this process of letting
go, for example, that you're

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:84%
talking about, let's look at
that through the framework

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.762 align:middle line:90%
of manifestation.

00:25:32.762 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody's
trying-- you're

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to gain something through
the process of manifestation.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And by and large, I'm sorry,
but a lot of the way it's taught

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:90%
is all wrong.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So you and I are on
the same page on this.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:90%
So you say it.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:90%
So it is an embodiment.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So whatever frequency
we're emanating,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.640 align:middle line:84%
the universe will say,
yes, match it, mirror it,

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.740 align:middle line:90%
and amplify it.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So it has to do
with the embodiment.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It is not how much
you want something.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So this really
freaks people out.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you want something; a
house, a partner, $1 million,

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.560 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what it
is, and you want and want.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you're emanating, the
frequency of want, the universe

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
will just match and amplify
and say, here's more wanting,

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.880 align:middle line:84%
not the manifestation
of what it is.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the frequency and feeling.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.947 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: It'll just
give you more want.

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to
recognize is that our desire

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and its fulfillment
are not separate,

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming
from the same place.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only separation
that exists between them

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.380 align:middle line:84%
are the beliefs,
concepts, and ideologies

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:90%
that we've put between them.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:90%
They don't actually exist.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:90%
It's all one thing.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
nothing separating.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So allowing yourself to feel
that, to be that, and then

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:84%
take the inspired actions
from that frequency

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.960 align:middle line:84%
is actually how you
can manifest anything.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter what it is.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.020 align:middle line:84%
I've gone from not being able
to move my body, feel my body,

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to putting my body
back together,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.480 align:middle line:84%
to having not a single
dollar in my bank account,

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:84%
because every dollar that was
left went to medical bills,

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to be able to manifest lots
of money without a problem.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.193 align:middle line:84%
So it has to do with
what I just said.

00:27:13.193 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not wanting, it's not
wishing, it's not hoping,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
it's not asking
for dispensation,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
or reaching out for
some other being.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
It's what it is that
you embody, the universe

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.120 align:middle line:84%
will match and amplify, and
that's how manifestation works.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were just
talking about how, oftentimes,

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:84%
people will look to others to
find out what's their direction

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
going to be and rather
than looking to themselves.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:84%
We'll turn to psychics
and other people

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:84%
to tell us how our life is
going to turn out, which

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate a good psychic.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
There are moments when I
just-- my mind is grinding

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking, let me just
get an outside point of view

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and I can appreciate that.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
we're the creators.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
prophecy, because right now,

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:84%
some of the most popular,
you know I'm going to say,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:84%
podcasts on YouTube
are all about prophecy.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's prophesying how
this whole chaotic thing

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:90%
is going to turn out.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about why
prophecy isn't actually working

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:90%
all that well right now.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
What the underpinnings of it
are, because we're just talking

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.020 align:middle line:90%
about fields of potential.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
thing to look at

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:84%
is that destiny is
always being written.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a moment-to-moment based
upon where your attention is

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:84%
going, your frequency,
how you're emanating,

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and what it is that
your desire is.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's really
no such thing to me.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
these things tangibly.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So destiny is always being
written all the time.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we keep putting our
attention on what's popular.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:90%
And what's popular, fear sells.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So the spiritual community has
learned from mainstream media

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.630 align:middle line:90%
that fear sells.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you put something on there
about doom and gloom, chaos,

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:90%
madness, we get lots of--

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's probably about
90% of the YouTube videos--

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: If not more--

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.528 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --of a
spiritual nature,

00:29:01.528 --> 00:29:04.090 align:middle line:84%
are all about a clickbait that
has to do with fear and gloom.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I did
a video actually just

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:08.040 align:middle line:90%
eviscerating that whole thing.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Agree.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: So let's talk about
what actually happens when you

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:90%
do that.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: So when you put your
attention on something that you

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:84%
don't want, so let's say
a doom and gloom scenario.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Chaos, madness.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.217 align:middle line:84%
And you're putting
your attention on it.

00:29:23.217 --> 00:29:24.017 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:24.017 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So when you put your
attention on something,

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:84%
you're actually drawing
that into your beingness.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.670 align:middle line:90%
You become a container for that.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you hold that,
emanate that frequency,

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and then build what it is
that your attention is upon.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:41.407 align:middle line:84%
We cannot create anything other
than what our attention is upon.

00:29:41.407 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What we're
resonating with.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Right.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So for your
attention is on this,

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.230 align:middle line:84%
guess what you're going to
hold, emanate, and then build?

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:90%
That.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So these doom and
gloom prophecies

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:55.650 align:middle line:84%
are actually user-manuals as
how to bring about these things.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.610 align:middle line:84%
If people really knew
the truth about where

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:58.750 align:middle line:90%
these things come from--

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about--

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I know you got a little thing
about bots and things, too.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We can go there.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So when we have these
podcasts, these shows,

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:84%
if The algorithm is supporting
it, the first thing we should do

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:90%
is question that.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Why is this so popular?

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Why do they want everyone
to know about this?

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth
of the matter is,

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:84%
they don't want you to know
the truth about yourself,

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:84%
about reality creation,
what we're talking about,

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:84%
about how things really
work because they would

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:90%
lose the illusion of control.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So if there's something
that's being heavily promoted,

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and the algorithm is
sharing it out everywhere,

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:84%
it's because they
want you to see that.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.850 align:middle line:84%
When we have someone who
shows up out of nowhere

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden gets
millions of followers,

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:90%
they're mega popular.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: That's
because those are bots.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:50.950 align:middle line:90%
They are promoting.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
They are rigging the system
as they always rig the system.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:84%
We have to start to understand
that if it's popular,

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.270 align:middle line:84%
it means the algorithm
is supporting it.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Think about what that means.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:03.987 align:middle line:84%
It means they want you to
put your attention on it.

00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh. absolutely.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.493 align:middle line:84%
And then once that person's
out and has millions of views,

00:31:07.493 --> 00:31:09.410 align:middle line:84%
then everyone jumps on
board because they have

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:90%
to have them on their podcasts.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Correct.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.687 align:middle line:90%
And we don't even realize that--

00:31:13.687 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly not
going to name names.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.650 align:middle line:84%
We certainly don't
even start to realize

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
that some of these people
are controlled opposition.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.397 align:middle line:90%
Some of these people have--

00:31:20.397 --> 00:31:22.730 align:middle line:84%
there's little three-letter
agencies that they answer to

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:23.850 align:middle line:90%
or they're paid to.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
things are just bots

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that are promoting these things
to make sure that we see it.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And the insidious
nature that goes

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:84%
beyond what we're talking about
is that a lot of these things

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.070 align:middle line:84%
actually have some
truth in them.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:90%
And this is where the hook is.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.182 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that
is where the hook is.

00:31:39.182 --> 00:31:41.970 align:middle line:84%
If you put a grain of truth,
a person can feel truth,

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.090 align:middle line:84%
but then they get this
conflicted feeling.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.997 align:middle line:84%
That's true, but the rest of the
story is not feeling so good.

00:31:47.997 --> 00:31:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: That's it.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So we get this kernel of truth
that all of us recognize.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, that
guy, that's right.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:90%
What that guy just said.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
else packed around

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
it is starting to take
us all the way over here.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.788 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to this
completely different direction.

00:32:01.788 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:90%
But now we're conflicted.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like, yeah.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But he just said something
that I know is true.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:90%
I know it's true.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But now he's directing
our-- she/he whatever,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.990 align:middle line:84%
directing our attention in this
complete-- so in other words,

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:84%
the bigger understanding of
the truth will remain hidden.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So we get a kernel, we get a
nugget, we get a little bit.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's the hook.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The controlled
opposition are the ones

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:24.955 align:middle line:84%
that get the most
views, especially

00:32:24.955 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual community.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: And they're like, oh,
I'm going to have so-and-so on.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.893 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
talk about whatever,

00:32:29.893 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:84%
or she's going to talk about
aliens and this and that.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you just don't really
understand what's going on.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:36.910 align:middle line:90%
You're getting this much.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of
it's distraction, too.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: That's the point.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: And to distract
us from ourselves.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: From ourselves.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: And onto some story
that has nothing to do with what

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:44.610 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
the discretionary process,

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:84%
because everybody watching this
has cruised YouTube and has

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.820 align:middle line:84%
gotten sucked in through
some clickbait to one or two

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.370 align:middle line:90%
or hundreds of these shows.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So where does our
true discretion

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:90%
come in as higher mind?

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Oh.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:90%
A great question.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So This takes some
level of detachment.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So we can't be caught
up in identifying

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:90%
with what we're seeing.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:90%
So number 1, how do I do that?

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:84%
The idea that I
always say is pretend

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.030 align:middle line:90%
you're watching a boring movie.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.610 align:middle line:84%
We've all watched
a boring movie.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't care what happens.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So we're just sitting
back and just watching.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:90%
And we're not--

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Emotionally detached.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.175 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: You got it.

00:33:21.175 --> 00:33:21.975 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:33:21.975 --> 00:33:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So with that detachment, will
give us a level of discernment.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Through discernment,
we'll get some clarity,

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.837 align:middle line:84%
and we'll start to
know what feels right

00:33:27.837 --> 00:33:29.290 align:middle line:90%
and what doesn't feel right.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's only through
that detachment.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:90%
That is the real key.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:84%
We can't be caught up
in any of these things.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:36.270 align:middle line:90%
That's number 1.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Number 2, what's out there
is not useful in the sense

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't give you
prescriptive protocols.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It gives concepts,
ideologies, beliefs.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:50.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the mentalization, Regina.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:52.422 align:middle line:84%
Everything has become
a mentalization--

00:33:52.422 --> 00:33:53.252 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:33:53.252 --> 00:33:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: --and
not the embodiment.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's missing.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
you mentally understand.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:84%
It's what you can tangibly
felt sense experience.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Is the only thing that matters.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So what we're getting is,
beliefs, concepts, somewhat

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.230 align:middle line:90%
some truth, some with no truth.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a mentalization.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:16.056 align:middle line:84%
We can mentally understand
that lifting weights makes

00:34:16.056 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:84%
you stronger, and we understand
that by lifting weights,

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.764 align:middle line:84%
it tears the muscle
off the bone,

00:34:19.764 --> 00:34:21.290 align:middle line:84%
it reattaches
bigger and stronger.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.050 align:middle line:84%
But don't you still have to go
to the gym to get the benefit?

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.429 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just because I mentally
understand how it works,

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:27.223 align:middle line:90%
I can get the benefit.

00:34:27.223 --> 00:34:27.596 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:34:27.596 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: This is what I mean.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.192 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting all these
mental understandings,

00:34:31.192 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
but there's no tangible
felt sense benefit.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:90%
And that's what the shift is.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.449 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That speaks
to the embodied nature

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.870 align:middle line:84%
of our receptivity
to information.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Because now, we're starting
to realize that this

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:90%
is a divine tuning fork.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.850 align:middle line:84%
What a complex system
the human being is.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Multidimensional,
complex system.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And your body knew right off
the bat that grain of truth.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:53.850 align:middle line:90%
That's like, yeah.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.489 align:middle line:90%
I feel that it settles here.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.305 align:middle line:84%
And immediately when you start
being taken down another road

00:34:58.305 --> 00:34:59.105 align:middle line:90%
it, you know it.

00:34:59.105 --> 00:34:59.905 align:middle line:90%
You feel it.

00:34:59.905 --> 00:35:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Your guts feel it,
your heart feels it.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.385 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do there?

00:35:03.385 --> 00:35:04.510 align:middle line:90%
Now you started feeling it.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:05.470 align:middle line:90%
You're using your body.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:90%
You're embodying your truth.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.042 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: Take your attention
off what doesn't resonate

00:35:10.042 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Immediately.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Because anything that
doesn't resonate with you,

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.070 align:middle line:84%
is not in alignment with you,
is actually not good for you.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:19.470 align:middle line:90%
It's taking you out of whack.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.982 align:middle line:84%
It's taking you out of alignment
with your own inner signal.

00:35:22.982 --> 00:35:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
ego mind identity is.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.210 align:middle line:90%
The human character.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And from a purely
physics perspective,

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:33.410 align:middle line:84%
the ego mind identity, the EMI,
is electromagnetic interference.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's everything that
we're attuned to that

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.420 align:middle line:90%
isn't our true signal.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: And this is
what leads us astray.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And this also pertains to
beliefs, concepts, ideologies,

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.490 align:middle line:84%
everything that we're
being bombarded with.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.255 align:middle line:84%
We're creating more and
more of a fake character,

00:35:47.255 --> 00:35:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and we're less and less in
tune with who and what we are.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet at the same
time, people feel like, yeah.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.615 align:middle line:90%
But I have to open my news up.

00:35:54.615 --> 00:35:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I have to at least
stay informed.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.615 align:middle line:84%
I can't be ignorant of all these
things happening in the world.

00:35:58.615 --> 00:35:59.656 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:59.656 --> 00:36:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.750 align:middle line:90%
I've heard that a lot.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A million times.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: You've probably
heard that a lot.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Up to a point, yes.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give a tangible
real world example.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.578 align:middle line:84%
When I get up in the
morning, and my wife

00:36:12.578 --> 00:36:14.703 align:middle line:84%
will laugh about this,
really, the first thing I do

00:36:14.703 --> 00:36:15.750 align:middle line:90%
is I look at the weather.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.070 align:middle line:90%
The weather app on my phone.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:90%
I just like the weather.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.130 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, OK.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Chance of rain maybe,
or whatever it is.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:24.910 align:middle line:90%
That's enough for me.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.382 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
a chance of rain.

00:36:27.382 --> 00:36:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll bring an
umbrella if I go out.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end of that.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.238 align:middle line:84%
I don't keep looking at it,
looking at it, diving in.

00:36:32.238 --> 00:36:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hour to hour.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's going
to be better at 11.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Let me go to like
seven other people that

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:39.650 align:middle line:84%
are talking about
the weather and let

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:90%
me get their information.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me see what
they have to say.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I get what I need in that
moment, and I move on.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest is
about me being who I am.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of understanding
what's going on,

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:51.530 align:middle line:84%
never occupy your mind with
anything that you can't control.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good idea.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: That will
clear everything up.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Never occupy your mind with
anything you can't control.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.430 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with that.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really big on
overthinking things at all.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe under-thinking, it seems
at times, but not overthinking.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:09.990 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
when you say, yeah.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But I am a responsible
co-creator in this world,

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and if these problems are
happening, I need to know,

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and I need to do
my part in this.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I need to do my part to help
heal and grassroots grow

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:90%
a new reality.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.905 align:middle line:84%
So now your mind is occupied
and it's pretty busy.

00:37:24.905 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Like, how can I contribute?

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.090 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.393 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: I think that
it starts at home.

00:37:29.393 --> 00:37:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, you know
like when you're on the plane,

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:33.370 align:middle line:90%
because I was just on the plane.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So they say if there's some
problem with like the cabin

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.142 align:middle line:90%
pressure, the masks.

00:37:38.142 --> 00:37:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Don't they always say,
put yours on first

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.070 align:middle line:90%
before you help anybody else?

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:41.910 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: OK.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So we need to clear up
our own house first.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are most of us in a
state of cosmic consciousness,

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.110 align:middle line:84%
in a state of joy and a state
of perpetual fulfillment,

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.490 align:middle line:84%
balance, harmony,
constantly in touch

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:84%
with our will, our
courageousness, our forgiveness,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.480 align:middle line:90%
and our compassion?

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of course.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:90%
That's the world we live in.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Right.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So if we're not
working in that way,

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:84%
why are we focusing on over here
and over here and over here?

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Those are the roles that we
think that we're playing.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm an empath
and I feel everything,

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and I need to do this, or I'm
a starseed and I'm here to do--

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But a lot of people
take a lot of comfort in feeling

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.890 align:middle line:84%
that they're an empath and
they're supposed to feel

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.772 align:middle line:84%
everything, but often,
it leads to-- well,

00:38:20.772 --> 00:38:22.230 align:middle line:84%
kind of like happened
to your body,

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.647 align:middle line:84%
it can lead to
that kind of thing.

00:38:23.647 --> 00:38:25.938 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: So let's say someone
calls himself an empath,

00:38:25.938 --> 00:38:27.890 align:middle line:84%
because I've heard this
a billion times too.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So that means they can only be
in accordance with the concept

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that they have of what
it means to be an empath.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.410 align:middle line:90%
They have imprisoned themselves.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It means they
can't operate or be

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.970 align:middle line:84%
outside of what their
idea is, of what it

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:39.950 align:middle line:90%
means to be an empath.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you can't give
yourself permission not to feel

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:90%
the pain.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Correct.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And you will never see
anyone in another way other

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.570 align:middle line:84%
than the context
of you viewing them

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.762 align:middle line:90%
from an empath's perspective.

00:38:49.762 --> 00:38:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So not only have you
imprisoned yourself,

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.090 align:middle line:84%
you've imprisoned
everybody else.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is what all labels do.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.190 align:middle line:90%
All labels are limitations.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And we do it for a
sense of self-identity.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:38:59.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm this.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:00.750 align:middle line:90%
No, you're not.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're the awareness of it,
that's proof that you're not it.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.058 align:middle line:84%
You're the awareness,
not what you're aware of.

00:39:05.058 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Like, here's my Gaia mug.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not my Gaia mug, I'm the
awareness of my Gaia mug.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm the awareness of the
feelings and the emotions.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm the awareness of
the thought process.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.980 align:middle line:84%
This labeling of ourself is the
collapsing of consciousness,

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.080 align:middle line:84%
constriction of energy, and it
imprisons everybody else, too.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.420 align:middle line:90%
So we have to drop the labels.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
how big the label is,

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.320 align:middle line:84%
because even the label
of ascended master

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.240 align:middle line:84%
is actually a limitation,
because that means

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.480 align:middle line:84%
you have to operate within
the concept of what it

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.620 align:middle line:90%
means to be an ascended master.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have now
imprisoned ourselves.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So no label will
ever be big enough

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.060 align:middle line:84%
to actually encompass who
and what we really are.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:90%
That's beautifully said.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wanted to get
into a lot of things with you,

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.140 align:middle line:90%
but we can't.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.682 align:middle line:84%
We've only got a
couple minutes left.

00:39:47.682 --> 00:39:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll do is we'll
have you back another time,

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll start
talking about the notion

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:84%
of the subconscious mind
as the Akashic record

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and expand on that
because people really

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.680 align:middle line:84%
trash the subconscious
mind because it

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.060 align:middle line:84%
does make us trigger happy
and reactionary and so forth.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But it is absolutely
essential that we

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.880 align:middle line:84%
work with it to transform
ourselves into the person you're

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.700 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.320 align:middle line:84%
As long as we don't have
the traumas and the story

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of our subconscious imbuing
our conscious minds, means

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.070 align:middle line:84%
we can never transcend the
programs of the subconscious.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.980 align:middle line:90%
So one final thing here.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.500 align:middle line:10%
The book is called Change
Your Mind, which I love.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.360 align:middle line:10%
I actually have it in
my briefcase with me.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I love it because
it's very direct.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:10%
You talk about
yourself a bit there,

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.280 align:middle line:10%
and then we talk
about what it means

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.320 align:middle line:10%
to be caught in the
world of thoughts.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And thoughts are not our friend.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:84%
We always think, oh,
everyone prides themselves

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:90%
on IQ and intellect.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.660 align:middle line:90%
That's OK to an extent.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And then there are poor little
kids are shoved down to a point

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.180 align:middle line:84%
where they have to become
productive citizens.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like you to make a
couple comments on productivity,

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll say
goodbye until next time.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: OK.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, perfect.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you have
a copy of the book.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:57.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: So productivity, I
just want everyone to let this

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.780 align:middle line:84%
land for a moment
without reacting.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Only a slave thinks in
terms of productivity.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, talk about
subconscious programming.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: People are
like, what do you mean?

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm no slave.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I have
to be productive.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Right.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So only a slave
quantifies its existence

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.640 align:middle line:90%
in terms of productivity.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
it is so deeply

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.160 align:middle line:84%
ingrained in our subconscious
mind and our body of energy.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.540 align:middle line:90%
It is not about productivity.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.880 align:middle line:90%
We are a human being.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Beingness.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we really want to do is
marinate within our beingness

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and then put our beingness into
our doingness as a flow state,

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.220 align:middle line:84%
not through, I got to do
this, I got to do that.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.165 align:middle line:10%
I got to do this,
I got to do that.

00:41:47.165 --> 00:41:49.680 align:middle line:10%
This is actually-- like
I said, the only a slave

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.860 align:middle line:10%
quantifies its existence
through productivity,

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:10%
and we will only engender
more people to follow that.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Part of this has to do with
only the supremely disciplined

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.560 align:middle line:90%
are free.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Because unless you are
supremely disciplined,

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:84%
you will be a slave to every
thought, every bodily sensation,

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.560 align:middle line:84%
everything that comes
across your way.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually we don't
foster self-discipline.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.700 align:middle line:90%
We don't foster self-control.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.280 align:middle line:84%
We foster productivity
and staying busy.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's no quality
of life in that.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have
realized at some point,

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm running myself ragged.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:84%
My wife, I'm running myself--
it's like I don't even enjoy it.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So if we can become disciplined
about where our attention is

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and where our energy
is, those are the people

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:90%
that are actually free.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.680 align:middle line:84%
The truly disciplined
people for absolutely free,

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.060 align:middle line:84%
because they're not a
slave to every belief,

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.340 align:middle line:84%
concept, thought, bodily
sensation, societal programming,

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.405 align:middle line:90%
and brainwashing.

00:42:48.405 --> 00:42:50.780 align:middle line:84%
When we start to work with
ourselves and change our mind,

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.660 align:middle line:84%
shows exactly how
to do it, we start--

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.290 align:middle line:90%
It's very direct.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:55.123 align:middle line:84%
>> SPINA: --we start
to work with ourselves.

00:42:55.123 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:84%
In that way, we will
realize that we're free

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and that we can actually create
the life that we truly desire.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:84%
That it actually
takes self-control

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.780 align:middle line:90%
and self-discipline.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.717 align:middle line:90%
Self-inquiry you have.

00:43:04.717 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Like you did, why am
I combing my hair?

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.080 align:middle line:90%
I want people to like me.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yeah.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have to go a
few layers to get to that one.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's true with every thought
we have, every action we do.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.910 align:middle line:90%
So that is discipline.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Yes.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.940 align:middle line:84%
RJ, wonderful to meet
you in the flesh.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Likewise.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.982 align:middle line:84%
And we will come back and
have this conversation,

00:43:23.982 --> 00:43:26.663 align:middle line:84%
and we'll start moving through
some of what you mentioned

00:43:26.663 --> 00:43:28.080 align:middle line:84%
in your book, By
Way of Protocols,

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to quickly start annihilating
some of these past beliefs

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.408 align:middle line:90%
and programs.

00:43:32.408 --> 00:43:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: That sounds like fun.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:90%
I look forward to it.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.100 align:middle line:90%
I look forward to it.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> SPINA: Thank you, Regina.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're welcome.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.080 align:middle line:10%

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.680 align:middle line:10%
Time to take back sovereignty
over our own minds

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:10%
with a little discipline.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:51.120 align:middle line:84%
