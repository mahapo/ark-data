00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Throughout history, we've

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.270 align:middle line:10%
been intrigued with
the Oracle of Delphi

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:10%
yet, know little about how
their history was obscured.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:10%
Marguerite Rigoglioso
is here with us today,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:10%
to speak about why these
powerful women were suppressed

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:10%
and by whom.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Even more fascinating, is
her take on the virgin birth.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a lot of juicy stuff
embedded in this upcoming

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.952 align:middle line:90%
You've done your homework.

00:00:40.952 --> 00:00:43.160 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's start
out with where you are now.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.452 align:middle line:84%
Founder of the Seven
Sisters Mystery School,

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and tell us a little
bit about that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:84%
before we go into Seven Sisters,
Pleiades, and on and on.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARGUERITE RIGOGLIOSO:
Exactly, exactly.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:10%
So my school is
dedicated to restoring

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:10%
the ancient way of the priestess
in service to the modern world.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:10%
And so, the way I do that
is by teaching people--

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:10%
primarily women-- how to
access their own inner knowing.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Become oracles.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Understand about our
feminine history.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:90%
History of the goddesses.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:90%
History of the priestesses.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So I have many online,
in-person courses.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
We do public events, public
ceremonies, healing ceremonies,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:90%
rituals.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And I have to just share this so
just before the cameras started

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
rolling, I dropped a bomb on
because I'd read your book

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and I was hoping
to tell you sooner,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:90%
that my husband's name is Zeus.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And you've got a major
bone to pick with Zeus,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get into
what happened with the oracles.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And how the intrusion
of the patriarchy-- i.e.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Zeus and son, Apollo, started
slipping into this story

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and distorting a lot
of different things.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.661 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I also explained to
you, but Zeus is recovering.

00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: He's recovering.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the
whole royal family

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.962 align:middle line:90%
is recovering with your family.

00:01:57.962 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, let's
go into the Pleiades.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:10%
First of all, most people
say, how does the Pleiades

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:10%
factor into this?

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But throughout your book,
you have several mentions

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
of the Pleiades and the beings,
and how they were communicating

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
with or influencing the women
at the time-- the oracles,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's really, layout that
connection before we begin.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So
the ancient Greeks

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
understood the Pleiades
to be essentially,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:90%
the seven mothers of the world.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:84%
These are the seven
starseed women,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
who came down from
this asterism--

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:90%
in whatever form that may be--

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.271 align:middle line:84%
and their DNA is in
every single human being.

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much
what the Greeks tell us

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
so this is not just a
new age, channeled thing.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.630 align:middle line:10%
But when we're talking
about the Pleiades,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about
these seven sisters.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:10%
They have names, and
they are specific.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:10%
They are the womb
mothers of humanity.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:10%
But what happened in their
story is that three of them

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:10%
were raped by Zeus, to
seed the human race.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.277 align:middle line:84%
So right there, we have
a problem with humanity.

00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why your eyes
went like that, when I informed

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:90%
you my husband's name is Zeus.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.341 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And I said,
you can't make this stuff up.

00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:16.525 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh my God-- chapter
7 of my autobiography.

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:18.899 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First thing you said
is, I have a bone to pick.

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes,
exactly because Zeus

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:90%
is, kind of, part reptilian.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And so he carries some
of that energy and so,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.080 align:middle line:84%
when that energy is
going into the Pleiades

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.099 align:middle line:84%
and then, the Pleiades
are seeding humanity--

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
along with these other
seedlings that we've

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
had from many, many dimensions
and many star systems--

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's all there
in the Greek story,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
which is why I love going back
to the ancient Greek material.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about, also, you're

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
looking at modern day oracles,
such as Barbara Hand Clow,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Marciniak,
who channelled beings

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:90%
from the Pleiades.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly,
and many others.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why it was really good
to go back to the ancient texts

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.295 align:middle line:84%
and find out who
these women were.

00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And how they're
related to the oracle--

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.050 align:middle line:90%
to go back to your question--

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
is that in the earlier oracle
was Dodona, before Delphi.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
place, another location.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And there, the priestesses
were called Pleiades.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
They were called peleiades,
which meant doves,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same
word as Pleiades.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So when I saw that,
as an academic

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
with esoteric leanings, I
said, I know what's going on.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.914 align:middle line:84%
Those women were
channeling the Pleiades.

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:84%
That's how they were
giving the oracles.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why they were named
the Pleiades and so forth.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So this Pleiadian
story really weaves

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:84%
throughout the entire
ancient Mediterranean world

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
because it's an origin story.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.640 align:middle line:90%
It even goes back to Africa.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And today, so the
oracles are rebirthing

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
through all of these
many channellers,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and this has been with
us in the Western world.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And going back to
indigenous cultures,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
we've always had
shamans and females

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.360 align:middle line:84%
who are giving this kind of
information for the people.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And, so what I'm doing
with the Seven Sisters

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Mystery School is of priestess
of the dove oracle training.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So I call it the priestess
of the dove oracle training

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
because it has that
resonance with the Pleiades.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And also, the dove is
the Holy Spirit energy

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that's also connected
to Sofia, which

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:90%
is divine feminine wisdom.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm helping to
do is connect women up

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:84%
with their divine
feminine wisdom,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:84%
which is something
that you can easily do,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:90%
when you just get quiet.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:90%
You close your eyes and breathe.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And I provide other
tools and techniques

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to get them into that
open state because we

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%
need this information.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just to wrap
it up on the Pleiades thing--

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
many people I've
interviewed talk

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
about sources of information--
beings and such--

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:90%
from the Pleiades.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:84%
What is your
understanding why that

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
star system of the seven
sisters and their obligation

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.209 align:middle line:84%
to or history with or
connection with Earth itself?

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Well,
I think they have

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:90%
a very long history with Earth.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And the piece that
I've been bringing in

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
is that, not only are they
the seven starseed mothers,

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
but because of that
karma with Zeus,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
they've been back peddling and
trying to make up for that.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Because what I
understood is that,

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades were
pursued by the Orions,

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:90%
and that's in the Greek stories.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Who are the Orions?

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:90%
They're the reptilians.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And they were pursued in
unwanted sexual fashion.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So this was a sexual predation
that these Orions wanted

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
these Pleiadian women, or
female beings, too, for whatever

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.020 align:middle line:90%
their purposes were.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I received in
my own oracle state,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
is that these Pleiades had
to make a compromise in order

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to be saved from that
total reptilian takeover.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Zeus said, well, I'll
come in, but you've

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
got to sire my children
on planet Earth.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened and
that's karma right there.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the
history, but there's

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.530 align:middle line:84%
many other pieces and times,
but that's the history

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.200 align:middle line:84%
that I'm most
interested in right now.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And that I'm most interested in
having women look at and become

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:90%
part of the solution.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And interestingly, all
of these archetypal characters

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:84%
that we know about through
mythology-- and their names

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
are different-- in each
of the mythologies,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:90%
their name is different.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:84%
The source of where they
come from is different.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:90%
It's always different.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to this
place of understanding.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
That is, many of these
players have traveled

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:90%
through all of these places.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.855 align:middle line:84%
It's not like-- because I
used have people tell me--

00:07:56.855 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Steven Greer and
all these people

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:90%
say, oh, you're a Pleiadian.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not an
Earthling, either.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I am has traveled
through these places.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:90%
And so at one stop, you're that.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:10%
At one stop, you're an Orion.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:10%
At another stop, you're from
the Crab Nebula somewhere.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really important for us

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:84%
to understand this because I've
had to look at this whole thing

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:90%
about, who are the reptilians?

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara Hand Clow and I have
gotten into that discussion,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to do another one.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:84%
In particular because it
plays into your story here.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And the expression of the
reptilians was both negative.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We know the more
colonization part of it.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And also, there entities
were just like Earthlings--

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:90%
are we good or bad?

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with them, as well.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But also, the notion
that your soul

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
could have traversed any
one of these star systems.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.745 align:middle line:84%
And you can be called out as any
one of them at any time, right?

00:08:51.745 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Regina.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:90%
I know it well.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO:
Because, believe me,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
what I have been shown
about my connection

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:84%
with the reptilians
is quite intense.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:90%
And talk about making up karma.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:84%
In each of us, there's been
a very interesting traversing

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
through star
systems and galaxies

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:90%
before we even came here.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes, exactly.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And one day, when I was in
an oracle state in the woods

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and I was using a sacred
medicine, I'm walking home

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, remember,
you're a Pleiadian ambassador.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what?

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, come on.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be telling
people I'm a Pleiadian

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:90%
ambassador, for goodness sake.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, yes, you are.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why not?

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Barbara and Barbara did, right?

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And
so, I said, well,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.740 align:middle line:90%
what does that really mean?

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I never
get a straight answer.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not from the
Pleiades, but I'm like,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:84%
supporting them in
that mission because

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:90%
of all this other karma.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I bring that up
just as a very wide focus

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:90%
for this conversation.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Within any one of these
people and characters

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%
in these stories, now, we're
looking for an end effect

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:90%
here or a progression here.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But when we're talking about the
players involved, any one of us

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:90%
could have been any one of them.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Reptilians are
us because I think that we have

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:90%
that DNA in our--

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we do have
some of that DNA, for sure.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: For sure.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.456 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
reckoning with when it's like,

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:90%
the good angel, the bad angel.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:90%
That literally, is true.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's what's got
us hamstrung a lot.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the oracles themselves.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And there were
parts of your book,

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
in particular, I
know that the nature

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:84%
of the oracles themselves
changed drastically over time,

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:84%
due to whatever the imposed
political agenda of the day

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about them from
the earliest evidence of them.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:90%
And who they were.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.044 align:middle line:84%
The nature of their being
and so forth on Earth, first.

00:11:00.044 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: This
is so important

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:90%
because this is a women's story.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And what we know of from
Delphi, is that originally,

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
even before the priestesses
started channeling Apollo,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
essentially, they
were channeling Gaia--

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness of Gaia.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:10%
Channeling the consciousness
of a female planetary logos

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:10%
is different from
channeling a solar god.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:10%
And then, even
before the location

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:10%
that we know of as Delphi,
there was the Korykion cave,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:10%
which is up higher
in Mount Parnassus.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:10%
And there are evidences of
knuckle bones for divination.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:10%
Circle dances.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:10%
So the women were doing great
deep mysteries up in that cave.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
look at time wise.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:84%
About how far back in
history would that have been?

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:10%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Well, the Delphic
Oracle goes back at least 1500

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:10%
BCE, if not earlier.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:10%
And so, that cave is
probably, at least, 3000 BCE.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
goes on and on and on,

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:90%
back to matriarchal times.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.330 align:middle line:84%
When we were tribes of women
in the center, men protecting.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And the women were
still connected

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to the Gaia knowledge
and the star knowledge

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:90%
and giving it out to the people.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So the history of the oracles
is the history of patriarchy.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:90%
These women were taken down.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
They were successively overrun
by male gods-- literally.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.970 align:middle line:10%
And then, their male priesthoods
who took over and said,

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:10%
no, you're not going
to have autonomy here.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to change
the age requirements.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to
make it so that we

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:84%
have to be in the
chamber interpreting

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:90%
what you're saying.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
there was a whole history
of what went down.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of
the major points there

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:90%
is what happened with Apollo.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:10%
He took over the oracle
by killing the dragon

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.536 align:middle line:10%
protector of Delphi--

00:13:01.536 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:10%
Drakaina the Python, also,
sometimes known as Delphyne.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's getting
into the dragons now--

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:90%
what are the dragons?

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:90%
They are the protectors.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:90%
They are portal protectors.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:84%
When he killed that
dragon, he left

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:84%
it open for
patriarchal incursion

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's definitely
what happened.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So they went from
channeling Gaia,

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:90%
to channeling Apollo, and--

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that starts
creating a perversion

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.990 align:middle line:90%
to the storyline, in general.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to just toss something
in here, for intrigue.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, I was
speaking with the beings

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
that I'm associated
with, or guides,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:90%
and I asked them about dragons.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And they said, they
were in this dimension--

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
in the same dimension that
we live in at one time.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:90%
They were physical reality.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They weren't just phased
off in another dimension.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
They were here, doing the things
that we credit them with doing

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And that simply, they do still
exist, but they're now living--

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.397 align:middle line:84%
because the Earth's
frequencies have changed also--

00:14:03.397 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
they're living in a slightly
phased off dimension,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:90%
but still exist.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And so, we can kind of
imagine a time when they were,

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
quite literally,
they were protecting.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Absolutely.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And they were visual.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:90%
People saw them.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even in the Greek
story, you have the story of,

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:84%
it was claimed that this dragon
being was marauding the town

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and so forth and that's
why Apollo killed it.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:10%
But here's another interesting
thing that I've received.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:10%
Is that, fallen
angelics used dragon DNA

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:10%
to create the reptilian races
and create a ton of confusion

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:10%
throughout the hologram of,
what are the good beings?

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:90%
What are the negative beings?

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And so, the negative
beings have continued

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
to foment that confusion
and therefore, confusing

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:90%
even, high level beings.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm going to kill that
reptilian, when they're really

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle line:84%
killing a dragon,
and they're confused

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:84%
about whether this being
is positive or negative.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
So this confusion is still
going on in our stories

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.019 align:middle line:90%
and our religious stories.

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And what's happening is--

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's still
going on in our culture--

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: In our culture.

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Across the planet.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And all the culture--
those messages

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.190 align:middle line:90%
are still being controlled.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It's
still being controlled.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:90%
And at the same time--

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
like you-- people are awakening
with their oracle information,

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:90%
saying, hey, wait a minute.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between
dragons and reptilians.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
snakes and serpents

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:84%
are the representations
of now, of the dragons.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And so, those are
all to be honored.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all those
things got demonized

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
in traditional religions.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of
women's story of having

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to resurrect these
ancient beings,

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:84%
these ancient
realities, and resurrect

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:90%
the oracle traditions.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
If not at these
places, well, we're

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:84%
going to do it in the comfort
of our own living room.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:84%
If the oracle portal at Delphi
was corrupted, or taken over,

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:84%
or disappeared, or
closed-- whatever it was--

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
each woman can be
the Oracle of Delphi,

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.222 align:middle line:84%
and that's what my
work is all about,

00:16:09.222 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:84%
with the Priestess of
the Dove Oracle Training.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think a
lot of men listen and say,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:90%
well, that's sexist.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:90%
What about us?

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, there have
been great oracles

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that are male, of course,
throughout history, as well.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:84%
However, if we just look
at-- as one of my guests

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:84%
recently stated, and
we know is true--

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:84%
if the corpus callosum is
thicker and better developed

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
in women, it simply allows
for a more expeditious

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
right-left brain
communication, which

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
allows for that
intuition to be expressed

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:90%
more easily in females.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.840 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the female
birthright, is that thing.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Just as you can say, certain
portions of the male brain

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
are developed more fully for
a type of incredible focus

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:84%
to do, to get things done,
in a way that a man would.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have to, I think,
take the sexism part out of it.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And say, if we
incarnate many times,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
we've probably
incarnated as both.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.060 align:middle line:84%
We choose, but we choose it
loaded with that particular set

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:90%
of variables or assets.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Definitely.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
We've all had karma, as male,
female, and everything else.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So what we're in
in this lifetime,

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:84%
is usually making
up for karma that we

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:90%
created in the other thing.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a
vociferous whatever,

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
usually, you're
healing something

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:90%
that you're responsible for.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there are,
have been, and will

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:84%
be fabulous male oracles
and oracles of all genders,

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:90%
since there's a lot of fluidity.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:51.445 align:middle line:84%
What's happening now, though, is
the re-emergence of the females

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:84%
because it's been so repressed
and that's been missing.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And when the female
goes missing,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:84%
all of her subject
areas go missing.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:90%
The womb goes missing.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
The things that we need to
know about social order,

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:84%
social organization, better
ways to raise children

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
in a non-traumatized way--
all of that goes missing.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nurturing,
cooperation,

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:84%
in favor of competition,
and individuality,

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.160 align:middle line:84%
which is, we kind of see where
we are with that right now.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: We sure do.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're seeing
the full effects

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:84%
of what the patriarchal
agenda has created in society

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:90%
at large, on this planet.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think everybody
gets, it's time

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.660 align:middle line:84%
for women to begin having
not just the ability,

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:84%
recalling it for
themselves, but also,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
the power publicly,
to start expressing

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.609 align:middle line:90%
these intuitive forces, again.

00:18:45.609 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Absolutely.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It's really, just
about balancing.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like, women
have been down here

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, we
need to come up.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking a little
bit more about women now,

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
well, that's just
what needs to happen.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not about erasing or
eclipsing the male, as well.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And as we know, there
are wonderful men

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:84%
who carry nurturance and
all of that sort of stuff.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's more just, an
overall cultural rebalancing,

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:90%
return of the goddess.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and recently,
a month or two ago,

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed the THEO--

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Sheila Gillette and
the THEO group, and I

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:84%
was talking to them
about the patriarchy.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:84%
We had a lovely discussion
on it, and I said,

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:84%
was there ever a time when
the tables were reversed?

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.959 align:middle line:84%
Because women are very
comfortable with the notion

00:19:30.959 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that we've been repressed
through the patriarchy.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I said, was it reversed
ever throughout history

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:90%
or times and places?

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yes.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how so?

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the
men were bowing down

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:84%
to and in fear of the
women because they were

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:90%
expressing their creativity.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
ones that, quote,

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
had command or control over
the view that the future

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:90%
and what was going to happen.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And in these certain
periods of history,

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
these men were made to be
subservient to the women.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I have definitely
received some of that

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
in my oracle work,
unfortunately,

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:90%
and I was like, oh my gosh.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:05.972 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:20:05.972 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can't be-- pointing
fingers go all directions.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.513 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: There's
really, no pointing fingers.

00:20:10.513 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, Len Kasten, when
he came on your show,

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:84%
was talking about the
queens and the Orions--

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:90%
that was familiar.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.127 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.127 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just say
this, again, this

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:84%
is all just laying
a framework where

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
it's time to get
beyond all of it,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:84%
to allow this balance--
masculine feminine--

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and societally,
between each other

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and within ourselves, to start
rising to its highest capacity

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:90%
That has to happen.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the only healing
that can happen, really.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.496 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:20:42.496 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And even though I'm focusing
on teaching women more now,

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:84%
these tools and techniques
are for everyone.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And it really is all
about each person

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:84%
becoming the oracle
in and of themselves

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:84%
so that they can bring in
the Library of Alexandria,

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:04.312 align:middle line:84%
the Akasha, into their daily
lives, into our cultural lives.

00:21:04.312 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, let's go back.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So the oracles--
they're starting

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:84%
to have an intrusion
from the male priesthood,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:90%
as history went on.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And the messages started
becoming distorted.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about what
that distortion looked like.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:84%
What it went from
toward at that time.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So my
sense is that, when

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.052 align:middle line:84%
the women were serving
as oracles for Gaia--

00:21:29.052 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and we're just
talking about Delphi

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.884 align:middle line:84%
because, of course,
I really want

00:21:31.884 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to honor all of the
oracular tradition

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:84%
that's been all over the world
in all the indigenous cultures,

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:90%
still is going on.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hundreds of thousands
of years, if not millions.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.973 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So just
specifically looking at this

00:21:41.973 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Western example, early Greece
was closer to the good part

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis, really--

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:90%
the positive part of Atlantis.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And to be an Oracle
for Gaia, it's

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
really like to be
a Lemurian Oracle--

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.050 align:middle line:90%
that's how I see it.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:90%
So what would that be all about?

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
That would be about well-being,
harmony, pleasure, flow,

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:90%
nurturance--

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of messages.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the oracle
starts getting taken over

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:84%
with these male gods,
people are coming

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:84%
with different
types of questions

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:90%
like, where should we colonize?

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Or should we go to war?

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Or there's a plague,
what caused it?

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Different matters of state.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So the women are having to
answer whatever questions

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:90%
are coming up at the time.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
were probably, also,

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.690 align:middle line:84%
being influenced by
Apollo coming through.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't have written
records of that--

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.760 align:middle line:84%
we have written records
of some of the oracles,

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:90%
but not a real lot.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of this is
intuitive speculation.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know-- one
thing I can say is that--

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
back in Pythagoras' time--
which is like the sixth,

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.780 align:middle line:90%
fifth century BCE--

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:84%
the oracles were
highly erudite women,

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:84%
like Themistoclea Pythagoras
admits in the ancient texts,

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that he got most of
his mystical precepts

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:33.660 align:middle line:84%
from this woman, Themistoclea,
who was an Oracle at Delphi.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
She was getting these downpours
of intuitional knowledge,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and he would be
scribing it down.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But fast forward to
Plutarch's time--

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
which is the time of Christ,
more or less, or after--

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and these women are peasants
from the countryside,

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:90%
who are taken.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
They must have been trained
in some kind of way.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.262 align:middle line:90%
Secluded, sequestered.

00:23:57.262 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't have anything
to do with the public.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:90%
They know nothing.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.480 align:middle line:90%
And they are just--

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're not a threat.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to be a
threat to the powers at be.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.519 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: They
are not a threat.

00:24:05.519 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And they are just becoming
mouthpieces for Apollo,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.739 align:middle line:84%
through the use of these drugs
that they're being given.

00:24:13.739 --> 00:24:15.822 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the part
I wanted to get to next.

00:24:15.822 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: We should
talk about that, too.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's got to be a
whole different ball of wax.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
The kinds of precepts that
are coming from Themistoclea,

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
versus the kinds of information
that are coming from a woman

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.310 align:middle line:84%
from the countryside who
has no worldly knowledge,

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:37.299 align:middle line:84%
is not really being given
access to her own divine wisdom.

00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:90%
She's just a mouth piece.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
very, very limited.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And they went from priestesses,
like Herophile at the time

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Trojan War--
like 1275 BCE--

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:84%
who would speak
in hexameter verse

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:90%
from one of the rocks rhyming.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, these women,
in the later period,

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.960 align:middle line:84%
its manic utterances--
that's, in part,

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.360 align:middle line:84%
why they have to have the
priest in there to try to make

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.290 align:middle line:90%
sense of what they're saying.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:90%
They're so drugged out.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.164 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
essentially, like you

00:25:07.164 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:84%
say, a mouthpiece, or just a
channel that's been taken over

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:84%
by whatever it wants to pour
itself through versus bringing

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
through one's own innate
wisdom and beyond,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
which the other women
doing prior to that.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Absolutely.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then,
the wisdom was--

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:84%
as you say-- was erased
from the equation.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And
that's documented.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.799 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that brings us
to the subject of entheogens

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and that goes all the
way through to what's

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.530 align:middle line:84%
happening today, which is a
largely male movement today.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So here we go so let's launch
into it because back then, they

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:84%
were used at that
time and as you say,

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.429 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of an
Apollonian agenda.

00:25:40.429 --> 00:25:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So what we
know from the Greek text

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:84%
is that there were different
substances that were probably

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.330 align:middle line:84%
used by these
priestesses, and it

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:84%
might have been different
substances at different times.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:10%
At one point, it might have been
hallucinogenic honey or honey

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:10%
that was spiked with a wine
or a hallucinogenic wine.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:84%
In another time, it might have
been lauryl-- chewing lauryl.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:84%
There's evidence that certain
lauryl species can make

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.700 align:middle line:90%
us go into an altered state.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
It may have been that they
were inhaling the vapors

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:90%
on the eternal flame.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.250 align:middle line:84%
It could have been some form
of cannabis-- for example.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But one of the main ways
is apparently-- and this,

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
we have from the
Christian writers,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:84%
who write in a horrified
way about this--

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that the woman would literally,
put her vagina over something--

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
whether it was fumes coming out
of the Earth so it could have

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:90%
these fumes--

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and she would take the
chemical in through her vagina

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and that would go
into her system.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Another time, it was
drinking the water

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that was infused
with these chemicals.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So it seems pretty
clear that these women,

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
at least during a certain
part of the oracle,

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
were using substances to be able
to regularly, reliably access

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:84%
this god, for the purposes
of addressing people.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
interesting because today,

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:84%
when you hear about
the collective--

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.350 align:middle line:84%
everybody's different and has
different experiences, I think,

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:90%
with whatever it is--

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Don Pedro, ayahuasca-- all
these different entheogens--

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:84%
so you can't say it's
cut out of one cloth,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.740 align:middle line:84%
but one thing that keeps
coming up regularly, it seems,

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:84%
is there are a lot of
reptile-type images

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:84%
that come to the surface
through a lot of the journeys.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I look
at that and I look

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.680 align:middle line:84%
at some of the more classic
studies, a lot of that

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
is kind of lower Earth
realm dynamic and dimension.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not a higher dimension.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:84%
It's actually, a lower
dimension, just below

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:90%
the Earth dimension frequency.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So
here's where that story

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:49.310 align:middle line:84%
about reptilians versus dragons
and serpents can come in handy.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I do believe that
things like ayahuasca,

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:84%
are getting at
the dragon serpent

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:90%
energy, which is in positive.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.607 align:middle line:90%
It's mama anaconda.

00:27:58.607 --> 00:27:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's going down.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It's going down
into these realms

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:90%
that have been affecting us.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with you on that.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's clear to
understand what's going on.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And we do have to
get down into it.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:84%
We do have to get into the
underworld-- so to speak.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Because the
underworld is not always bad.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you're
not going to cure anything

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.570 align:middle line:84%
in terms of healing,
until we understand

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.174 align:middle line:90%
the dynamic we're dealing with.

00:28:22.174 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And also, the underworld is,
itself, a place of wisdom.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's positive underworld
and negative underworld.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:84%
There's the loamy healing place
and then, there's the, sort of,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.250 align:middle line:90%
evil place.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Just like there's high
light and not so high light.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Four quadrant schema here.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think that when people
are using entheogens today,

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.170 align:middle line:84%
they have to be
discerning, and this

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:84%
is where training
can really come in,

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:84%
which is why I'm very
much into this training

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.090 align:middle line:84%
because it helps people
navigate these realms.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.176 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they have to
get into an ethical alignment

00:28:59.176 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
with themselves and
do a lot of healing

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:84%
because the more healed you are,
the better an oracle you are.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.087 align:middle line:90%
The more discerning you are.

00:29:06.087 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
The more you can distinguish
between reptile and dragon.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So also, when you go
into these states,

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
you have to be able to
discern what's going on.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.130 align:middle line:84%
When are you being taken
for a negative ride?

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
When are you just being shown
something that you really

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.989 align:middle line:90%
need to be shown?

00:29:26.989 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When are
you being tricked?

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.305 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: When
are you being tricked?

00:29:30.305 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:90%
What is useful information?

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:90%
What isn't?

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, one of the
big discussions

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I have in the Priestess of
the Dove Oracle Training

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.260 align:middle line:90%
is tests of validity.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:84%
How do we validate
information that's

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:90%
come through whatever means?

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Be it sitting in a
meditation and transmitting

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.410 align:middle line:84%
your goddess-self--
that I call it.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Or whether it be in
a medicine session.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Or whether it be with
an intuitive downpour

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.510 align:middle line:90%
that you get on the subway--

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is an inner
discernment, but part of it

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.910 align:middle line:90%
is a communal discernment.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to bring
the information out to others,

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:90%
to sisters, to brothers.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Talk about, does this
make sense to you?

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Is this resonating for you?

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's
the test of time.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you keep getting the same
information again and again?

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And are other people starting
to get this information?

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So there are many, many ways
that we can distinguish.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.210 align:middle line:10%
But I do think that entheogens
can be a very good tool.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:36.360 align:middle line:84%
They were a major teacher for
me, but only used in ceremony,

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.830 align:middle line:90%
never recreationally.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:90%
You see, that's the distinction.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was very
respectful of these plants,

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
respectful of me.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me how to
recognize an open channel

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.700 align:middle line:10%
So people can use them,
but like you're saying,

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:10%
now, it's becoming a
little bit of a male game.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:10%
And then, you get all
the domination of it.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dominantly
male, which makes sense.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.380 align:middle line:84%
If it's more
difficult, in general--

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:84%
not specifically,
but in general--

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.580 align:middle line:84%
for the male to open up
to the intuitive capacity,

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.380 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go at
it however you can.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.498 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with women who
have masculinized themselves--

00:31:13.498 --> 00:31:16.020 align:middle line:84%
which we have done over the
last couple of thousand years--

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.800 align:middle line:84%
to basically, fit into
a left brain world,

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:84%
women can't access their
intuition either, anymore.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.785 align:middle line:84%
And so, I can see why it
would be attractive to

00:31:25.785 --> 00:31:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and draw women in,
as well, but it

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.270 align:middle line:84%
is to compensate for
that which we've lost.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.485 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:31:31.485 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And for me, a little went a long
way because I was so sensitive.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is the case,
often, with women.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
They can get overwhelmed by
dosages that males would take.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So back to this day,
now, they're taking these--

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.010 align:middle line:84%
young maidens gathered
from around the countryside

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:84%
with little knowledge,
little wisdom

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.730 align:middle line:84%
are gathered so that
they can be trained

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:84%
to be able to just essentially,
be a channel for whomever

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.650 align:middle line:84%
is on the other side and wishes
to pass messages through.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's no discernment
happening there.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, let's talk
about how that interface

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.117 align:middle line:84%
with, maybe, a reptilian agenda,
would be a good way to say it.

00:32:10.117 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And
first, I want to say

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that there were different
age requirements of the women

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and that makes a
difference, as well.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I think the original were
the post-menopausal women.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.029 align:middle line:90%
Then, they became maidens.

00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:25.320 align:middle line:84%
By the time we have the Greek
records, they're maidens.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, they say that because
one of the girls got raped,

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
they changed it to, you had
to be over 50 years old.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.302 align:middle line:84%
My guidance was, it was
more than one young girl

00:32:36.302 --> 00:32:37.260 align:middle line:90%
that was getting raped.

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a whole posse.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.200 align:middle line:84%
That's how you change 2,000
years of tradition, not just

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.610 align:middle line:90%
for one incident.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So then, the women would still
wear the dress of a maiden--

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:84%
the longer outfit-- but
they would channel Apollo

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.180 align:middle line:84%
from that perspective and
I think, that initially,

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:90%
they were the wiser elder women.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.770 align:middle line:84%
We need older women to be
the oracles because they

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.600 align:middle line:90%
have more life experience.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:90%
But I think that--

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:09.420 align:middle line:84%
to go to your question
of, how they can be used--

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:84%
well, if we think that
Apollo is the son of Zeus,

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.710 align:middle line:84%
who is a reptilian,
essentially, being--

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and I think Apollo brings
more light to the matter--

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and this Oracle was
basically, taken over,

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.580 align:middle line:90%
taken away from the women--

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:35.100 align:middle line:84%
this is just another way to
continue to justify warfare.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.677 align:middle line:84%
These oracles are
not saying, well,

00:33:37.677 --> 00:33:38.760 align:middle line:90%
where should you colonize?

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.451 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be
colonizing at all.

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Where should you be doing war?

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.290 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be
doing war at all.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.900 align:middle line:84%
They're already in
the patriarchal agenda

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:84%
so I think this is kind of
how this reptilian patriarchal

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:56.430 align:middle line:84%
agenda is going on, on all of
these major oracle portals.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have
the complete shut down

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
of the oracle
portals themselves,

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:90%
by the Christian emperors.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other layer.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, these oracle
women become what?

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:11.280 align:middle line:90%
The Vestal Virgins.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.949 align:middle line:84%
And there's evidence
from history--

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and also, from what I received--
that these Vestal Virgins were

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:84%
actually being used to give
birth to reptilian sons--

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.210 align:middle line:90%
kings-- and so forth and so on.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And their oracle ability is
shut down completely by now.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Their womb power is being used.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Their shakti is being used.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.320 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole womb
element and the keeping

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.210 align:middle line:90%
the fire of Vesta going.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's degenerated
from them being

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:84%
able to bring any kind
of information in.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:90%
So yes--

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.204 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now we're down
into the Judeo-Christian era.

00:34:50.204 --> 00:34:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It's just been
a long history of demise.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Removal of the dragons.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Removal of the women.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Incursion of the
patriarchal heroes.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Because Theseus,
Perseus, and Hercules--

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.780 align:middle line:90%
are all sons of Zeus.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.540 align:middle line:84%
They're reptilian right there,
and what were their missions?

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:84%
They started going
about systematically

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:84%
dismantling the
female priestesshoods,

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.790 align:middle line:90%
if you look at all of them.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Theseus was raping and
abducting Helen of Troy,

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:90%
well before the Paris story.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We've got Heracles'
his seven laborers,

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.590 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, 12 laborers.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.530 align:middle line:84%
If you look at them,
I analyze them--

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that's dismantling of
matriarchy, dismantling

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:36.730 align:middle line:90%
of the priestesshoods.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Perseus cutting the
head of Medusa off.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole story
history and karma that

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:90%
is related to me right there.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:90%
These are--

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
Zeus and his sons

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.620 align:middle line:84%
have hell to pay today
because we're back.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.953 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: But that's why
they're married to you now,

00:35:52.953 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:90%
because you're helping.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if I were to
use my Zeus as any indication,

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.250 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous amount of
knowledge, wisdom, and healing

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.989 align:middle line:84%
has taken place there, which
is absolutely beautiful.

00:36:03.989 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Blessed be.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.220 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
needing and wanting.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.770 align:middle line:84%
I think men are
awakening as women are.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So one question I have,
just to kind of go back

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.860 align:middle line:90%
over that a teeny bit.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Of the messages coming through
the oracles, how historically,

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
was it made known that they
were always from Apollo?

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Or were they from just other
forces that were Apollonian,

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.260 align:middle line:90%
in nature?

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Is it fair to say that these
messages were literally

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.350 align:middle line:90%
coming from Apollo?

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:38.070 align:middle line:90%


00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:90%
But that is a good question.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Hey, why don't we just
do an oracle on that one?

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we just say, was
it always coming from Apollo?

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Or were there other
things coming--

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There were a
lot of Babylonian forces

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.640 align:middle line:90%
out there, not just Apollo.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.931 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:50.931 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:90%
So that's an excellent question.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to look at
that one because right.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.560 align:middle line:84%
He may have been the
entry way, but there

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.300 align:middle line:84%
were all sorts of
things that these women

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.466 align:middle line:90%
were starting to give forth.

00:37:03.466 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.057 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Clearly.

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would be a
guess or just kind of a hunch.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That sounds like
a really good intuitive oracle

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:11.690 align:middle line:90%
guess.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have fun
with it, and let

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.450 align:middle line:90%
me know what you come up with.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I'll write
another blog on it for you.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.468 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:20.439 align:middle line:84%
And so, now, when we
take the Grecian culture

00:37:20.439 --> 00:37:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and the best of Greece back,
that goes back to the best

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:90%
to be Egypt.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And the best of Egypt goes
back to the best of Atlantis.

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:90%
And so it goes.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's take
it even further back.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
How did Lemuria,
Atlantis, and Greece,

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:36.650 align:middle line:84%
all factor into, or tie
into, what you're doing

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.420 align:middle line:90%
and the way you're doing it now?

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Because those were
passed on bodies

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of high wisdom and
knowledge, that arguably,

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:90%
stopped in Greece.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I was too bastardized
by Rome then,

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and it just wasn't
working anymore.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.370 align:middle line:90%
So the question is--

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
how Lemuria and Atlantis

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.110 align:middle line:90%
factored into all of this.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And factors into the
teaching-- the Pleiades,

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Seven Sisters, and
what you're doing.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: One thing we do
know is that there is an origin

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.590 align:middle line:90%
story for Atlantis--

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:90%
the island of Atlantis--

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:15.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Greeks, that is
Poseidon and the Seven Sisters

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.730 align:middle line:84%
of the Pleiades
are founding beings

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.250 align:middle line:84%
for Atlantis, which is
very, very interesting.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So there is Pleiadian
karma in Atlantis,

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and how that relates
in a timeline,

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:34.426 align:middle line:84%
to when they seeded
humanity, I don't know.

00:38:34.426 --> 00:38:35.300 align:middle line:90%
I think all of this--

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.466 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting
because in Egyptian lore,

00:38:37.466 --> 00:38:38.380 align:middle line:90%
it's Osiris.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.490 align:middle line:90%
It was an Osirian founding.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think you keep
going back and looking

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.920 align:middle line:84%
at the names of the players
and their identities

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and where they're
believed to be from,

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:51.100 align:middle line:84%
keeps changing the further
we go back in the layers.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, more the
vibrational feeling of it,

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that we're bringing
through, right?

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.258 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're taking
the story back a bit,

00:38:58.258 --> 00:39:01.220 align:middle line:84%
before Greece, before
ancient Egypt, to Atlantis,

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about that part
of the story, in the Pleiades

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.830 align:middle line:84%
and how you're bringing this
forward in your Mystery School

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.120 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So there
is one Atlantian origin

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:14.384 align:middle line:84%
story which says, that
it came through Poseidon.

00:39:14.384 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, through
a lineage, there

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.799 align:middle line:84%
were the Seven Sisters
of the Pleiades, that are

00:39:17.799 --> 00:39:19.940 align:middle line:90%
founding mothers of Atlantis.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about early times

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:28.010 align:middle line:84%
of human seedings,
human colonizations,

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:84%
human civilizations
that are on the Earth.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I think, at this point,
Lemuria had already gone down.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:38.152 align:middle line:84%
And the way I see it is, Lemuria
was more the feminine energy--

00:39:38.152 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I think, probably,
you see that, as well.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Many do.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Atlantian was starting to get
in more the masculine techno.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beginning to, it
was over a very long period

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:47.710 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.940 align:middle line:84%
It went down in stages and
ended up there, for sure.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And
ended up there.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So I think that originally,
Atlantis was very high level.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the women
were right in there, providing

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:84%
very high level
esoteric information

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.660 align:middle line:84%
about sound healing, and
the nature of reality,

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and what we can do to go
in and out of dimension.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think, again,
it progressively

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.790 align:middle line:84%
became more male-oriented,
more patriarchal.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think that it goes
back to that reptilian agenda,

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:32.750 align:middle line:84%
where the males were
disenfranchised from the Orion.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And the queens were
in charge over there

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and they were like, hey,
let's go for greener pastures.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Planet Earth, OK.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's stuff going on here,
and let's get all involved.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to make
sure that it became

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.430 align:middle line:84%
a male-oriented, patriarchal--
as we're calling it--

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.990 align:middle line:90%
patriarchal bastion.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think, that
reptilian agenda

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.160 align:middle line:84%
is part of the
patriarchal agenda.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So women in Lemuria,
early Atlantis,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.080 align:middle line:84%
are systematically
getting disempowered,

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.194 align:middle line:84%
getting disempowered,
getting disempowered.

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And along the way,
somewhere through all of this

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.010 align:middle line:84%
historically, you say,
then, the thinning

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.130 align:middle line:84%
of the veils between the worlds
began-- white and black magic

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.570 align:middle line:90%
began being played out.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.785 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:41:13.785 --> 00:41:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Or the
thickening of the veils.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that,
back in those times,

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.660 align:middle line:84%
we were more easily
able to see dragons.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.590 align:middle line:90%
The fay, fairy beings.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:24.749 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thickening is
a better word, right?

00:41:24.749 --> 00:41:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: The dragons,
the fay fairy beings--

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:29.400 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
that were, what now,

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.320 align:middle line:90%
are firmly on the other side.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.220 align:middle line:90%
They were around.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.719 align:middle line:84%
They were even in
the Greek stories.

00:41:33.719 --> 00:41:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We hear the stories of
the nymphs and all that.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:90%
They were seeing them.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:90%
They were cavorting with them.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.260 align:middle line:84%
They were having
relations with them.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.910 align:middle line:90%
They were marrying them.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:44.430 align:middle line:90%
All that.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So over time, as part
of what was happening,

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was becoming more
and more enshrouded in lower

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.270 align:middle line:90%
dimensional frequencies.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And what I was shown, in my
own oracle state, is they said,

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.200 align:middle line:84%
when Atlantis was
founded, they were shown,

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.140 align:middle line:84%
it was going to be a challenge
to keep that vibration up,

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:90%
but they said, no, we can do it.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.670 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But over time , it
was just like grime,

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:90%
one particle after another.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.595 align:middle line:84%
And then, these other
agendas coming in

00:42:18.595 --> 00:42:21.540 align:middle line:84%
with manipulative
technology and so forth.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, completely taking the
womb and the women out of it.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
technology's main objectives,

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.520 align:middle line:84%
is to take the womb
and women out of it.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the return
of the female oracle

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.630 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.338 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
because in this sense,

00:42:38.338 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:90%
the veils are now thinning.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: They are.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we are starting
to see and remember, again.

00:42:42.335 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.780 align:middle line:90%
And we need womb power.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.220 align:middle line:90%
We don't need AI.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:90%
We don't need more high tech.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.550 align:middle line:90%
We don't need more computer.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:90%
We need more womb.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.220 align:middle line:84%
We need more wisdom
coming from the womb.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.540 align:middle line:90%
We need more understanding.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And women who are serving
as oracles saying,

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:06.060 align:middle line:84%
hey, Sophia is prime
creator, and she's the womb.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:84%
We need more female
oracles saying, hey,

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:84%
you want to know the
shape of the universe?

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a womb.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Check it out with
the Mandelbrot set--

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.250 align:middle line:90%
the big image.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.020 align:middle line:84%
They usually have
it sitting upright,

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.770 align:middle line:84%
like Buddha, or on
its side, but you

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:90%
turn it and it's the vagina.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:10%
It's the womb.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.615 align:middle line:90%
The epithelium of the vagina.

00:43:27.615 --> 00:43:29.700 align:middle line:90%
That's mother.

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what we need
to get back to.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
really important

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:37.590 align:middle line:84%
to get more female
oracles on the planet now,

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:42.300 align:middle line:84%
to bother even looking at these
topics that a lot of channelers

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.480 align:middle line:90%
would not be looking at.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.090 align:middle line:90%
We need to restore.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.550 align:middle line:84%
We need to draw back
from the Akashic records,

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:middle line:84%
to draw this knowledge back
and to draw the ways back

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.360 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like when
White Buffalo Calf

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Woman who some say, she was
a Pleiadian sister, when

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.690 align:middle line:84%
she came, she was seeing
that there was corruption.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.490 align:middle line:84%
First of all, don't look
at me in that sexual way

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.610 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking at me--

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:90%
let's get that straight.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And number two, here
are all these ceremonies

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that you can restore again, to
bring balance to your people.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:84%
These are the types of
streams of information

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.940 align:middle line:90%
that we need coming back again.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And women are going
to be the ones,

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:26.160 align:middle line:84%
by virtue of their interests,
to bring that information in so

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that we can write the situation
that's going on right now.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And arguably, the same
women who were oracles then,

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.389 align:middle line:90%
exist now, have reincarnated.

00:44:34.389 --> 00:44:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Absolutely.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.314 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the cast of
players have taken the stage.

00:44:39.314 --> 00:44:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thus,
the type of work

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.190 align:middle line:90%
you're doing-- for example.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.040 align:middle line:90%
So it is happening.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.319 align:middle line:90%
That is already occurring.

00:44:45.319 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: We're back.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're back.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And you say, the next step
is a fifth dimensional state

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:51.600 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness or awareness.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.174 align:middle line:90%
What's that look like to you?

00:44:54.174 --> 00:44:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It's starting
to happen all around us.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.150 align:middle line:90%
First of all-- for example--

00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.950 align:middle line:90%
I come here.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.730 align:middle line:90%
What do I find out?

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.896 align:middle line:90%
Your husband's name is Zeus.

00:45:00.896 --> 00:45:03.990 align:middle line:84%
That's a fifth
dimensional synchronicity.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So we look at the
synchronicity factor.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Then, we look at, what
kind of information

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.780 align:middle line:90%
are we starting to get?

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Is it my imagination or does
that person look like a fairy?

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Or hey, did I actually
see a fairy walking around

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:17.900 align:middle line:90%
over there?

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.690 align:middle line:90%


00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:24.560 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many higher
intuitional capabilities--

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.940 align:middle line:90%
abilities to heal--

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:84%
but also, part of it
is the great purging.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.460 align:middle line:84%
As we're going into
fifth dimension,

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.680 align:middle line:90%
it's not like, love and light.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.240 align:middle line:84%
It's whatever hell is
in your personal life,

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.730 align:middle line:90%
your field, your karma--

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:84%
it's getting leached
out right now.

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you're feeling the
worst that you've ever felt,

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:45.050 align:middle line:84%
that's part of these, what
some people are calling,

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:46.636 align:middle line:90%
these ascension symptoms.

00:45:46.636 --> 00:45:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well-- as
you say-- that once

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.160 align:middle line:84%
we start opening to our
intuitive faculties,

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that that's often when the
wounded child part starts

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.570 align:middle line:90%
emerging.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.916 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It so does.

00:45:57.916 --> 00:45:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
really is important--

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.620 align:middle line:84%
as I was saying earlier on-- it
really is important for women

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:08.360 align:middle line:84%
who are getting this training,
to start doing the shadow work,

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.200 align:middle line:84%
even more deeply because
the wounding will come in,

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and the wounding will
affect the messages.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we shouldn't be
confusing the wounded child

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.499 align:middle line:84%
message with the fact
that our mother was

00:46:21.499 --> 00:46:22.790 align:middle line:90%
mean to us when we were little.

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:24.880 align:middle line:84%
We're talking wounded
child over eons.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Over eons.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:26.680 align:middle line:90%
It's both/and.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like we've had
these personal traumas

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:34.970 align:middle line:84%
in our life, which are the
latest in a stream of thousands

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:36.620 align:middle line:90%
of years of trauma.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, reptilians and
Archons and whatever else

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:41.330 align:middle line:90%
has been going on here.

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to
reverse this equation,

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.740 align:middle line:84%
get this spiral going in
a different direction,

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and we need the
feminine for that.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.988 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about in
your own personal experience

00:46:50.988 --> 00:46:53.450 align:middle line:84%
or in that of some of the women
that you've worked closely

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:57.800 align:middle line:84%
with, where you have these
powerful faculties opening back

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:04.310 align:middle line:84%
up, but the wounded child aspect
of their psyche is not healed.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:06.190 align:middle line:90%
And what comes of that?

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Or what can come of that?

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Well, you
can get distorted messaging

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:22.130 align:middle line:84%
or you can get messaging that is
still of somewhat, patriarchal,

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:29.850 align:middle line:84%
or misleading, or not as
high vibration as it could.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:32.079 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I see.

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And so, that's
why we need this training.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:35.744 align:middle line:84%
We need more
trainings like this.

00:47:35.744 --> 00:47:38.090 align:middle line:84%
We need more conferences
where people can come together

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and say, wow, here's
how this came in.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And wow, that person
got hooked right there

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:47.090 align:middle line:84%
in that chakra, when she was
giving that reading, or I was.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a
lot of vigilance.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.589 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do, and
a lot of courage.

00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: A lot of courage.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you say, you
had to go back and look at some

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:59.810 align:middle line:84%
reptilian experience,
and tell us what--

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:02.750 align:middle line:84%
you're brave-- tell us what that
was like for you to go through,

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:04.850 align:middle line:90%
on this path of healing.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Hell.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Well,
first of all, it

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.621 align:middle line:84%
started when I was in
my own psychic training

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting there
and having an experience

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.240 align:middle line:90%
with another person.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, oh, my
God, I was an inquisitor.

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:22.760 align:middle line:84%
That was light
dawning, number one.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh my gosh.

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But even going back further in
some medicine journeys, where

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I saw that the
goddess' were feuding,

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I was shown the shadow
side of the feminine.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, it came to the
shadow side of myself.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, over the years, it was
listening to Len and your show.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Len Kasten.

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: He was talking
about the reptilian queens

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and I was just like, why do
I know so much about that?

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And over time, I
had already been

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:54.830 align:middle line:84%
starting to get the information,
that I was a reincarnate.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And with that show, I started
putting it all together

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and I realized, holy
cow, that's why it's been

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.610 align:middle line:90%
so tough for me in this life.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:11.330 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm with
such a serious mission.

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:13.829 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that's not
my only existence.

00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been the divine
birth priestess.

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We've been everything.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I've been
oracles-- like we were saying.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.260 align:middle line:84%
But this is a major
piece of karma

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.602 align:middle line:90%
that I am making amends for.

00:49:23.602 --> 00:49:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're here to lift
the feminine spirit up again.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Lift the
feminine spirit up again.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:34.364 align:middle line:84%
And really, not be in that
negative shadow feminine.

00:49:34.364 --> 00:49:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's a deep one.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.446 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It's a
deep wide, and it's

00:49:37.446 --> 00:49:40.370 align:middle line:84%
affected me in every domain
of my life, like personal.

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Like everybody thinks, I
want to be a priestess,

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.280 align:middle line:90%
it's so glamorous.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.322 align:middle line:90%
It is not glamorous.

00:49:47.322 --> 00:49:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to
put your big girl--

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:middle line:84%
as Larry the Cable
Guy would say--

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.610 align:middle line:90%
your big girl under britches on.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right,
you do have to do that.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.821 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You do, but
this is serious stuff

00:49:56.821 --> 00:49:59.990 align:middle line:84%
because there's a shadow
side to femininity that

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:04.280 align:middle line:84%
exists to this day, that no
one in the women's rights

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.710 align:middle line:84%
movements ever
wanted to talk about

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and still don't
talk about today.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is, this incredible
competition between women.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Women are very ungenerous
with other women

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and allowing other
women to shine.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can understand
through patriarchy,

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.980 align:middle line:84%
why that may have been
because your survival depended

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.926 align:middle line:90%
on whoever your mate was.

00:50:25.926 --> 00:50:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to cast
you over for a better, newer,

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.140 align:middle line:84%
shinier model, or whatnot,
your survival is at stake--

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.220 align:middle line:90%
historically.

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So we get why it's
happened, but it didn't just

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.310 align:middle line:90%
happen 2,000 years ago.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: No.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, let's
talk about this part of it.

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:43.384 align:middle line:84%
We have, looks like, about
seven or eight minutes left.

00:50:43.384 --> 00:50:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think, it's
important to get

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.650 align:middle line:84%
into the shadow of the
female so we can understand

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:49.580 align:middle line:90%
what has to be healed.

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I would imagine,
you've encountered this a lot

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in the work that
you've been doing.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:51:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Any woman who starts having
some level of success,

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.320 align:middle line:84%
you're go-- you're going to
encounter that feminine shadow

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.915 align:middle line:84%
immediately-- from within
yourself, from others.

00:51:07.915 --> 00:51:11.020 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.160 align:middle line:90%
I've had it both ways.

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.710 align:middle line:90%
I've had it thrown at me.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've experienced
the jealousy.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, one of the
major things I've been doing

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:25.420 align:middle line:84%
is the shadow work, with
myself and with students.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And in the women's
spirituality movement, as well.

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the first people
to see that the goddess'

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:31.980 align:middle line:90%
were feuding--

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.010 align:middle line:90%
oh, my God.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:36.396 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll, get to that
in just a sec, as an example.

00:51:36.396 --> 00:51:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: We've
had karma, where we

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.910 align:middle line:90%
haven't been such nice ladies.

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, part of it is making up
that karma, healing that karma.

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And on top of it, there's all
this wounding of patriarchy

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.180 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So this dealing with the
negative energies that

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:59.620 align:middle line:90%
can come in among women is key.

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.710 align:middle line:84%
It's really, really
important right now,

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:06.290 align:middle line:84%
for us to get anywhere because
entities are everywhere.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:10.180 align:middle line:84%
They are willing, ready,
and able to come right in.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Bust up groups.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Bust up partnerships.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Bust up whatever.

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:16.450 align:middle line:90%
They love it.

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So any time there is a little
wobbliness in somebody,

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.150 align:middle line:84%
or between two
people, or in a group,

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.610 align:middle line:84%
they'll come right
in and shut it down.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So the people that I respect
the most in the world

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:32.680 align:middle line:90%
are doing this deep shadow work.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It's about looking
at your own wounds.

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:37.600 align:middle line:84%
What is the wounded child--
that's the point of the power--

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.910 align:middle line:84%
what is the wounded
child within me?

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:42.010 align:middle line:90%
How can I love this child?

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:46.434 align:middle line:84%
And then, be less susceptible
to these other types of emotions

00:52:46.434 --> 00:52:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and these competitions
that can come in?

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the wounded
collective because that's

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:50.910 align:middle line:90%
where it comes in.

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Women have to start working
with and looking at each other,

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.090 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, in a new way.

00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
in reading your book,

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at when you
were on the subject of Zeus,

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.960 align:middle line:84%
there were some passages
about his wife Hera, who

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.829 align:middle line:84%
was known to have this wrath
against the other women

00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:10.120 align:middle line:84%
that Zeus took up with--
which was, pretty much, anyone

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.600 align:middle line:90%
he could get his hands on.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, but what I went back and
thought, these are archetypal,

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:17.200 align:middle line:90%
supposedly immortal beings.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Why would an immortal being
experience wrath and jealousy?

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:25.720 align:middle line:84%
What is it they were
afraid of losing?

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Because somewhere at the top
there, is what women fear.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I know.

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:34.482 align:middle line:84%
And I was shown recently, this
is why people on planet Earth

00:53:34.482 --> 00:53:36.190 align:middle line:84%
are having to go
through the meat grinder

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:39.097 align:middle line:84%
and the sieve right now,
to leach this stuff out

00:53:39.097 --> 00:53:40.930 align:middle line:84%
so that when you do go
into fifth dimension,

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.650 align:middle line:84%
you don't carry those
characteristics with you.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they said to me, look
at the Olympian Pantheon.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.990 align:middle line:84%
They said, that's
a clear example

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:54.370 align:middle line:84%
of people who didn't
do their work.

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And they took it with them.

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, the stakes got
even worse and higher.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have rapes
of the entire universe.

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.280 align:middle line:84%
You have jealousies
of women that

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.280 align:middle line:84%
are killing this, and
that, and the other one.

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh, I finally got it.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:10.210 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow,
those are immortals

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:12.310 align:middle line:90%
who didn't do the work.

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:14.980 align:middle line:84%
We have an opportunity
to do the work-- that's

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.610 align:middle line:90%
why it's so hard right now.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And it might take several
lifetimes for this actually

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:19.870 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, it won't.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, we'll have a quantum--

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.970 align:middle line:84%
maybe, we'll have
a quantum leap.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But we do, we have
to look at the pain--

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:29.510 align:middle line:90%
like that pain of Hera.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just wrathful
against the other women

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:34.085 align:middle line:90%
that Zeus took up with.

00:54:34.085 --> 00:54:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And
who hasn't had that--

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:36.790 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that
in this lifetime.

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've had it in
this lifetime, too, but why?

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Where is it coming from?

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Fear of survival?

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:42.520 align:middle line:84%
What is it actually coming
from in the feminine?

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a feminine thing.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Lack of
love, need for love.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Need for love.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:48.020 align:middle line:90%
It comes to that.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:48.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Connection.

00:54:48.895 --> 00:54:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Connection,
acknowledgment, love.

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:51.070 align:middle line:90%
honoring.

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, the
feminine even more--

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and the masculine needs it too,
but even more so, the feminine

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:59.200 align:middle line:84%
needs that deepest
connection, and it

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:02.560 align:middle line:84%
feels like that's violated
with those infidelities--

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.650 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes, absolutely.

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is where coming
into the sacred heart

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is so important in
whatever way you see that.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Some have different archetypes
for that or different masters

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:15.430 align:middle line:90%
that they're working with.

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But coming into that
sacred heart energy

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and integrating all the chakras,
is a very deep important part

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.740 align:middle line:90%
of that work.

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, being the oracle
is about being the holy woman.

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Being unified and elevated
in all of her chakras.

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Being able to bring in that high
Sophia energy and the Mother

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Earth energy, and offer it
to the people like this.

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because I
have seen many, many examples

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and sat across from a few, of
the feminine that brings back

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:47.040 align:middle line:84%
some of their intuitive
oracular capacities,

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.600 align:middle line:90%
with none of the healing.

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.430 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes hubris.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It becomes very
arrogant and distorted.

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And not to be trusted.

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Absolutely.

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Even getting ready
to come to this show,

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I was having a look at
this all night long.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Why am I there?

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.074 align:middle line:90%
The part of me that wants glory.

00:56:07.074 --> 00:56:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, the part of me
that's like, wait a minute.

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I am a reforming reptilian,
Pleiadian ambassador

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.060 align:middle line:90%
who's got a mission.

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm a woman of the heart.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.726 align:middle line:90%
I want to be in my heart.

00:56:17.726 --> 00:56:18.600 align:middle line:90%
I want to be in love.

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.425 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:56:20.425 --> 00:56:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, any final
comment before we say goodbye?

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Glad we got into this
the last 10 minutes.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.809 align:middle line:84%
It's a very powerful and
necessary discussion.

00:56:28.809 --> 00:56:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It's
really, really powerful.

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I would just say that, I do
whatever I can to support women

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.685 align:middle line:84%
in this work, through Seven
Sisters Mystery School

00:56:39.685 --> 00:56:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and right now, the Priestess
of the Dove Oracle Training.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's one thing on
the planet right now,

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.300 align:middle line:84%
where people can
come to check it out.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:58.080 align:middle line:10%
The bigger picture here is that
we are all doing our healing

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:03.090 align:middle line:10%
and whatever we can do to do
that very deep personal level

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:06.120 align:middle line:10%
healing, is the
most important way

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.630 align:middle line:10%
that we are going to
individually and collectively,

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.610 align:middle line:10%
move into fifth
dimensional consciousness.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.509 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here, here.

00:57:13.509 --> 00:57:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And you've done a
wonderful job of research

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.740 align:middle line:90%
in your various books.

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank
you for joining us.

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:20.198 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
brave enough to share

00:57:20.198 --> 00:57:21.750 align:middle line:90%
your own personal piece of this.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And also, your generosity
in helping other women

00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:25.690 align:middle line:90%
find their way.

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:28.410 align:middle line:84%
