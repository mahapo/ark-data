00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: 100 years
ago, we lived in a world

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:10%
free from radiofrequencies, no
Wi-Fi, EMFs, no 5G, in fact,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:10%
no processed foods
for that matter.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:84%
It was a world where
people worked harder

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.870 align:middle line:84%
to keep life moving forward
but had the energy to do it.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, one of the
biggest complaints

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:84%
today is a feeling
overwhelmed and tired even

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:90%
with every convenience.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.385 align:middle line:84%
Nicolas Pineault, the EMF guy,
is here to tell us why that is.

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:41.185 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Nicolas.

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time
I've had on this show.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NICOLAS PINEAULT:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's a very,
very important topic that's

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.883 align:middle line:90%
affecting so many people.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:84%
We were talking off
camera a little bit.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.717 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into some of that.

00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But just starting with one of
the hard facts, in your notes

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that I was looking at,
you say our exposure

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to radiofrequency radiation
has increased by 1 quintillion

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:90%
fold--

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
1 quintillion, I don't even
know how many zeros that is.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:84%
We'll have to count it
out-- in the last 100 years.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: It's crazy.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:10%
100 years ago, we
were not exposed--

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:10%
four generations
ago, we were not

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:10%
exposed to all of
these agents that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:10%
is radiofrequency radiation.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, smart meters, cell

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:10%
towers, cell phones,
and now we're

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:10%
getting into more and more
different smart things

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:10%
that people have glued
to their body but also

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:10%
smart things in their homes.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
the multiplication

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:84%
of the different sources
of radiofrequency.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And just one generation
ago, my generation--

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm 36-- we didn't have
Wi-Fi when I was young.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
We got it, I was in
my teenage years.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So my son who's five
is the first generation

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that are exposed to this
radiation cradle to grave.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.983 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big concern.

00:01:58.983 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big concern.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're from Montreal, a
little bit of a French accent

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Are you living in a
high density area?

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Or do you--

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: I am.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.427 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so we're
going to get into all that.

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
That can be a little
harder to control.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: For sure.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But first of
all, what I want to do

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
is get into the history
as we as humans,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
what happened when electricity
was first introduced

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:90%
to the human species?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Some of the effects, I mean,
there were some politics

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
around it knocking down
people's windmills,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.820 align:middle line:84%
doing deals with
the energy company.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It was of scummy
business, actually.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
first electrification

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:90%
of planet Earth.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: For sure.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Scientists and amateurs
and circus people

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:84%
started playing with static
shocks at the end of the 1700s.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
In Arthur Firstenberg's book,
"The Invisible Rainbow,"

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
he talks about the fact
that some people receiving

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
static shocks-- we're
talking about very low level

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:90%
electricity there.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Some people were starting to
get effects that were negative.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
They felt that their
nervous system couldn't

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:90%
handle even static shocks.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a
lot of electricity.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So even in those
early days, you had

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:84%
some hints of people that
were more electrosensitive

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And that continued through the
electrification of the world.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think it was
still in the 1700s when I read

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
his book a few years ago,
I remember this one--

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] it just
came up, sorry.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
They had a kissing machine
that was a kind of a parlor

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
thing among the wealthy
where you had the person who

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
was going to be the kisser
hooked up to electricity,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and then a person could
come and kiss them

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:90%
and get this electric shock.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.367 align:middle line:84%
It was a risquÃ© party
game of the day.

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Exactly.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was so silly.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we move past
the 1700s, all right,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.215 align:middle line:84%
and we move into the actual
mass electrification.

00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: For sure.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
We started with the
Telegram, and then

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:84%
eventually, it was
the introduction

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:90%
of the radio and TV.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And radio doesn't just
appear in the air.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
think about the fact

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:84%
they open the little knob in
their car, and there's radio.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because the waves
are being blasted everywhere

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that it's being
blasted everywhere all the time

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.140 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make it safe.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It just means that
it's there, and that--

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
has it been contributing to all
of these new chronic diseases

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:90%
we're seeing?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Arthur Firstenberg says yes.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And many, many-- we're
talking about hundreds

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
of EMF scientists
in the world say

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
we have a big
problem on our hands

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
because now we've moved from
these radio waves and TV waves

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:90%
to now cell phone towers.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was at the
end of the 1980s

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
where cell phones
were not very popular.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.670 align:middle line:84%
It was for rich people with
huge Nokia bricks in their car.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that
much of a problem yet.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:90%
But now--

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we've way up
leveled the problem now.

00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Exactly.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now we're in trouble.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Exactly.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, the
species is in trouble

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
if we can't learn how to
modulate and manage this.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're very
adaptable as beings,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:84%
we can adapt to
a certain extent,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
but we're not
adapting fast enough.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.485 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: For sure.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go
back a little bit.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
the time when people

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
started getting
electricity in their homes

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
where they could
have electrical light

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:84%
bulbs, where they could
ultimately even have

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:90%
refrigerators and such.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And Firstenberg brought
up what happened

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
when the Spanish flu
occurred and electrification

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.430 align:middle line:90%
at roughly the same time.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:84%
You can talk about the theory
and what you think about that.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Well, the
theory is that each time we

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.670 align:middle line:84%
start rolling out new
electric technologies,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:84%
a segment of the population
starts getting sick,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and some of it is
blamed on other things.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So he says with the
Spanish flu, there's

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
been the rollout of certain
man-made technologies

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.370 align:middle line:90%
that emit radio waves.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of it was radar,
and also some of it

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:84%
was throughout the
different decades

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.233 align:middle line:90%
we had satellites going up.

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The military
was very much affected,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:90%
the young men in the military.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.333 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: In the
military, for sure.

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have military
research that

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
shows that some
military personnel

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:84%
after a few years of exposure
to radars start getting sick.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So there are good reasons
to think that if you're

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:90%
too close to sources--

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and now that's the
reality for most people

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
that are too close
to these towers--

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
you get sick over time, not
necessarily just in one day

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
but over many years
working in these submarines

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:84%
or on different airplanes they
were exposed to the equipment.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And these people, part of
them, start getting sick.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:84%
They report that they
cannot sleep anymore.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
They report that
they have headaches.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And what they report also,
on getting sick all the time

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
because it impairs
your ability to have

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.142 align:middle line:90%
a healthy immune system.

00:06:44.142 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note, I'm
going to tell a little anecdote

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:90%
because it's relevant.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.837 align:middle line:84%
So in the 1980s, I
was a news anchor.

00:06:49.837 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have all the
cell phone technology

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:90%
at that time and such.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But on the top of our newsroom
was a massive satellite dish.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I got sicker and
sicker to the point

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:84%
where I could
hardly get through--

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I was so exhausted
on the weekends.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I did the night
time news anchor.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And on the weekends, I really
couldn't recover anymore.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And it got to the point where
I could hardly lift my arms up

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.623 align:middle line:84%
anymore to even blow dry
my hair and put makeup on

00:07:21.623 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:90%
before I went to work.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And I had to peak at
the end of the day.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine, who
I ended up ultimately

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
having what was either we
thought chronic fatigue

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
syndrome and Epstein-Barr in my
blood-- that's what shows up.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:84%
My friend, a news anchor
sitting under her satellite dish

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, had the
exact same array of symptoms.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And the dish was right
on top of our building.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.160 align:middle line:90%
No one was talking about EMFs.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So what would you
imagine would be

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
happening sitting under
a satellite dish all day

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:90%
every day?

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Well, we have case
studies from the last two years

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
telling you what's
going to happen

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
if you have a 5G tower installed
right next to your apartment.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Part of these case
studies were published

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Leonard Hardell.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:84%
He's the first one who dared
say that Agent Orange was

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:90%
a carcinogen.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: So he's a hero--

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: --in
epidemiology and toxicology.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And now he says that
people who get a cell phone

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
tower installed on their
apartment-- and these case

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:84%
studies have been published
in scientific literature

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:84%
where these people within a
few months start deteriorating.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Their health goes down,
exactly what you've described.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I have chronic fatigue.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.089 align:middle line:90%
I cannot digest anymore.

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.889 align:middle line:90%
I have headaches.

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we started with
horrible digestive issues--

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: There we go.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.537 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that
remained with us.

00:08:39.537 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seemed
to damage us almost

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.632 align:middle line:90%
on a cellular or DNA level.

00:08:42.632 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: And
what's important is

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:84%
this, in these
case studies, when

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
they get out of
this environment,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:90%
they start getting better.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So right there you
have a causative agent

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that is making people sick
not necessarily in one week,

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
but when it's that
close to your home,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
it can be pretty
fast for some people,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and their health
starts going down.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that makes sense.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go
camping, suddenly you

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:84%
just feel like
you're born again,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and you have energy
after a couple of days.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
In our case, this other friend
that's a news anchor and I,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:84%
all the introduction of the
more saturated technology

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.980 align:middle line:84%
started coming in even
after we left the newsroom.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And it never-- a lot of those
symptoms didn't fully go away--

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Yeah.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --after that
original mass exposure.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, we have to
realize some of these

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.525 align:middle line:84%
do have long-term effects you
have to wind your way out of.

00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: For sure.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so before we
get into what starts happening

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:90%
after we had the radio--

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
television, radio,
and so forth--

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
what's happening

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to children who are still
in their formative years.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:84%
What's happening to the
development of a child's brain?

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Even in utero, what's happening?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:90%
What studies are out there?

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:84%
What is happening
to our children

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:84%
if we live in an
EMF-rich environment?

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: It starts
with pregnant moms.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Their exposure when
it's higher, they

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:90%
have more risks of miscarriage.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like it is
disrupting the normal processes

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
that should be happening
normally behind the scenes when

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:90%
you're pregnant.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're always
thinking about what's

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:90%
happening to your fetus.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything is supposed to
just be in the right place

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:90%
and starts developing normally.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:84%
We know that in
animal models, it

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
will disrupt the birth
weight of children.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:90%
It will disrupt their health.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And also in rats, in
rat and mice studies,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:84%
we saw very well that if
pregnant rats were exposed

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.850 align:middle line:84%
by radiofrequency at
a much higher level

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
than their offspring,
their children

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
would have bigger risks of
developing food allergies

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:90%
or ADD/ADHD symptoms.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But in the last decade, we also
have large epidemiology studies

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:84%
in humans that show
the same thing.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, huge rise
of ADHD in the last two decades,

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
in particular since we've
all been carrying cell phones

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and have our home
computers, et cetera.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: The message from
Yale scientists, Hugh Taylor,

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, very
mainstream universities,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:84%
they say stop putting that phone
near your pregnant abdomen.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
They say that the
data is very clear,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and that this is a dangerous
game that we're playing.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Increasing our
exposure in the womb

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and also to small children,
the same risks also apply.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's very concerning
to me with a five-year-old.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
me as well.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to what we were
talking about a moment ago.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:84%
When the Spanish flu
came about, a lot

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.100 align:middle line:84%
of the people that were
really severely affected

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
were these radar operators
according to his work, right?

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's move
forward a little bit.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So by 2017, it was stated
that a third of the population

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:84%
now has electrosensitivity,
by 2017, OK.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's advance
that a couple of years,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:90%
and we get a pandemic.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's sitting
home alone on their devices

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:90%
more than ever.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
While we got a spike
protein in our bodies

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that were being
exposed to, a virus,

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
what do you make of how
that confluence of events?

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
What do you make
of what it could

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:90%
have done to humanity at large?

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: For sure
it's not helping.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the data to say--

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:84%
some people have advanced things
like, well, the 5G rollout

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:90%
created those symptoms.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
For sure electrosensitivity
is on the rise and for sure--

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and there's good
papers on the topic

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
even though it was nearly
impossible to publish

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:90%
on that link.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.195 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: There
are good papers

00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:84%
on the topic by Dr.
Beverly Rubik who coined

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:90%
the term human biofields.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:84%
She's a prominent
frontier scientist.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And she said that there
are multiple reasons

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:84%
to think that our immune systems
are greatly impaired when

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:90%
we are under EMF exposure.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Guess what happened
when people were home?

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:90%
EMF exposure was tremendously--

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 24/7, practically.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: --higher
than previously.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Yeah, so I think
that people did the opposite

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:90%
of what they should have done.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going outside
and lowering exposure,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:84%
be in nature, be relaxed,
they stayed inside and blasted

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
themselves with EMFs
almost all day every day,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:90%
which is crazy to me.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a crazy time, and
it was a crazy reaction,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.053 align:middle line:84%
but people didn't
know what else to do

00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:90%
because they were forced apart.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't go to public
venues and so forth.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:84%
This was a really
negative impact of that.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want to ask
about something else.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things happen
regarding the heart.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:84%
The heart's
electrical in nature.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things happened
during that pandemic period.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:84%
People's hearts were really
damaged on a lot of levels--

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
fear, not being able
to be with each other,

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and also being in this
saturated EMF environment.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the
cities were seriously

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:90%
beginning to roll out 5G.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you couldn't make a
better scenario for poor health

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.830 align:middle line:84%
in the confluence
of these events

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and lowered immune
system as a species.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So now we talked about
that for just a moment.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the heart itself.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Have there been any studies of
what all of these frequencies

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:90%
are doing to our hearts?

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Well,
I'm aware of two

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:84%
different holistic
cardiologists who told me

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:84%
they have some patients come
into the clinic, doctor,

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:84%
there's something
wrong with my heart.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
They have a phone right
there in their shirt pocket.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:84%
They remove the phone, tell
the patient to go home,

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:90%
and it's fixed.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So for some people, it
seems to be a direct impact

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
to the rhythm of their
heart is disrupting it,

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:84%
which is not that
complicated to understand

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
the heart as a rhythm that
is set by electrical pulses.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: So if you have
something else electrical,

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:90%
there might be an interference.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And guess what happened?

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Is that now with
cell phones there

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.240 align:middle line:84%
are warnings for users of
pacemakers to the effect

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:84%
that if you put it too
close to the pacemaker,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
it might be disruptive
to the pacemaker.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And they even said it
could be life threatening

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.940 align:middle line:90%
but not to a human heart.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.095 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:15:13.095 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very interesting.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: --very interesting.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're both
electrical signals.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Right, exactly.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
not going to go

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.575 align:middle line:84%
that far because there's
too much politically

00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:90%
and monetarily at stake there.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.850 align:middle line:84%
They'd probably be
censored and stripped

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.085 align:middle line:90%
of their titles, et cetera.

00:15:25.085 --> 00:15:25.885 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Yeah.

00:15:25.885 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But years ago, Dr.
Martin Paul, who's

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:84%
a professor emeritus at the
Washington State University,

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:84%
said that according to
his analysis of what

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:84%
EMFs do to our cells,
it is especially

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.200 align:middle line:84%
dangerous to the
heart because of how

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:84%
it can damage certain specific
cells in the heart that

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:90%
are responsible for the rhythm.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So he said that
according to him,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
EMFs can directly impact
your risks of heart failure.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.385 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't seen any
cardiologists pick up

00:15:57.385 --> 00:15:58.185 align:middle line:90%
this idea.

00:15:58.185 --> 00:15:59.102 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:15:59.102 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: But these studies
need to be done for sure.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
just pure logic.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't there already be
1,000 studies on its effect

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:84%
on the heart, except for
the political reasons

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:90%
we just mentioned a moment ago?

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:90%
What about DNA?

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
What is it doing to our DNA
and, again, the developing DNA

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.017 align:middle line:90%
of a fetus and young people?

00:16:20.017 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Well,
we have good reasons

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
to think that cell
phones and all

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
of this radiofrequency damages
DNA and also hinders DNA repair

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's because it will
increase oxidative damage.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
These oxidative species,
like reactive oxygen species,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
are basically increased
in a level that is

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:90%
overwhelming to the organism.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So normally, we have
certain antioxidants

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that are created in our body
that can take care of those.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But we are already exposed
to the sun and certain things

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
in our food and so many
sources of oxidative damage

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes you add
phones, or Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:84%
in the mix, and it becomes
overwhelming to the system.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is when you
have DNA breakage.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that in
the rat studies.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
We saw that in vitro models
where you just have cells,

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and you expose it to
cell phone radiation.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:84%
There were major
studies that proved

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
without the shadow
of a doubt that we

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
can have some sort of DNA
damage from this technology.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But these studies are not
even mentioned by regulators

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.820 align:middle line:90%
when they set standards.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot of--

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you want to
address this now or later,

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:84%
but there is a
strong corporate will

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:84%
to keep things as is, to
keep the EMF limits high

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and never look at
the health impacts.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.768 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we'll go
there in just one second.

00:17:50.768 --> 00:17:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering, because
you brought this up,

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
about telomeres, the telomeres
on our cells and the health

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and the length of cellular life.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.560 align:middle line:84%
These delicate, little
hair-like extensions

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.760 align:middle line:84%
from the cells that take in
electricity and information

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and determine the length
of the cell life, those

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.997 align:middle line:90%
have to be affected by this.

00:18:11.997 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: I haven't
seen anything specific

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:90%
on telomere length.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.540 align:middle line:84%
But many EMF
scientists are starting

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
to talk about EMF
exposure as something

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.343 align:middle line:90%
that is an aging impact.

00:18:24.343 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
would be telomeres.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Exactly.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: So you're
going to age faster

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:90%
in a high EMF environment.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one scientist, Dr.
Magda Havas from Canada,

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:84%
said instead of calling
it electrosensitivity,

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.332 align:middle line:84%
I prefer calling it the
rapid aging syndrome.

00:18:39.332 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:84%
That answers that question
because the premature breakage

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.190 align:middle line:90%
of telomeres is our aging.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Our cells age as--

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Exactly.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --we age.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So even if they
haven't called it that,

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Stuart Hameroff is
the guy on that.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It'd be interesting to see
if he's done any work on it.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to what
you were talking about.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Why would all these
companies want

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:84%
to have high levels
of EMF production?

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: It's
business as usual.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Business is good.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And the lobbying power
of the telecom industry

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
surpasses big pharma
at the moment.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So people think
that, oh, there's

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:84%
corruption with pharma or big
food influencing regulators.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same thing is
happening but even more

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:84%
exponentially with
the FCC and regulators

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
around the world where the
regulators are completely

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:90%
captured by industry.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
heads of the FCC,

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Communications
Commission in the US,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
basically was sworn
in as the director,

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I'm going to
destroy the FCC from the inside

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:90%
out and he did.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And now the FCC is not
looking at health impacts.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
They're just essentially--
Robert F. Kennedy

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Jr., that I had the
chance to interview,

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
told me they are a sock
puppet for the industry.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
They don't do anything
regarding health.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to do
is to clean up the house

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
because things are
stalling on many levels

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:84%
because the industry
is in control

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:84%
of the funding of
what's going to be done.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of the regulation,
i.e., lack of all regulation.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Exactly, exactly.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's criminal.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It's unethical.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
It's lacking compassion
for humanity.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing I can say
about this other than that.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:90%
It's all bad.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.207 align:middle line:90%
So now let's talk about--

00:20:27.207 --> 00:20:29.290 align:middle line:84%
in some countries, they've
taken a little bit more

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:90%
seriously than the US has.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
We're all in on the corporate
level and not warning

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:90%
our citizens of what's--

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.894 align:middle line:90%
except for people like you--

00:20:36.894 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:90%
of what's at stake here.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about phone gate.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Yes, so phone gate
happened when a French doctor

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
found out that the French
government had tested hundreds

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:84%
of different cell phones with
0 millimeters of separation

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:90%
from the body.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.450 align:middle line:84%
This is how we
use phones, right?

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It touches our face.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:57.982 align:middle line:90%
It touches our--

00:20:57.982 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wherever
our pockets are.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.732 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: --pockets, exactly.

00:21:00.732 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's very close to the body,
except manufacturers normally

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.630 align:middle line:84%
test it 5 to 25
millimeters from the body.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
exactly, but there are--

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell Americans
how far 25 millimeters is.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:90%
We think in inches.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Oh, well, I
mean, it's very small,

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:84%
but still that degree
of separation--

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not on your body.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: --it's
not on your body.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:10%
And people don't realize, but
if you go 1 millimeter closer,

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:10%
you might greatly increase
how much radiation that is.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So what this French
doctor found out

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:84%
is that essentially, 90% of all
phones sold in France in 2018

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:90%
were not compliant.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:90%
They were over the safety limit.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, this
is still happening.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are good
reasons to think

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that it's the vast majority
of phones around the world

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:84%
go over the safety limit,
sometimes by many fold.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And this led to the iPhone
12, for example, in France,

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.860 align:middle line:84%
they had to lower the
radiation level that is emitted

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:90%
by this particular phone.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:90%
And why the 12?

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why the 12.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
They need to do that
with the 13, 14--

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And everything else.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: --15, 16,
and everything else.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's just another
trick by the industry

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:84%
where they were able to game
the system to expose users

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
as much as possible because
they keep saying two things.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
They keep saying, well,
users want faster phones,

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:90%
so we're going to do it.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:90%
More radiation is good.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And they also say there is
no health effect whatsoever.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a lie.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: --the
biggest lie, completely.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're just
lying to the public.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.585 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: For sure.

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, there should
be huge types of penalties

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:84%
for lying to the
public in that way

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and deceiving us on such an
important issue, of course.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them use the
excuse, you guys want to--

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:90%
you guys love gaming.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:84%
5G is the ideal
platform for gaming,

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:90%
fast, fast, speed, speed.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And they use gaming
as a primary issue

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
of why we're demanding that we
have this kind of technology

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.300 align:middle line:90%
all around us.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Yeah.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:90%
But that's an illusion--

00:22:59.170 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: --that we need
faster speeds and faster Wi-Fi.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:90%
You know what's fast?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:90%
A wire.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And ethernet.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Yeah.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ethernet wire.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: It's thousands
to millions of times

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:84%
faster than Wi-Fi
because instead

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:84%
of sending a signal
through the air that

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:84%
has a resistance to
it, you're sending it

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
through a fiber
optic, a glass cable.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So the most
efficient way to have

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
gaming and all sorts
of things in society

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that are currently wireless
is to have them wired.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:90%
So we could--

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then you
don't have it in your pocket

00:23:32.135 --> 00:23:34.720 align:middle line:84%
when you're waiting in line, or
on an airplane, or something.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: No, for sure.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
convenience, it's always

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that comes down to
this convenience

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and needing immediate
gratification.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:90%
The species is--

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: That's correct.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what we've
been trying to get to.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: The
point is many things

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:84%
that are wireless at the
moment could be wired.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: And then it
would lower the levels.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So again, that's
just-- but the industry

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
is pushing more wireless,
wireless, wireless,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and say cut the cords.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:90%
We don't want any cords.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:84%
But again, people
who listen to Gaia

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:84%
don't go to McDonald's
generally speaking

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.772 align:middle line:84%
because they know that
convenience can hurt them.

00:24:05.772 --> 00:24:06.572 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:06.572 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: The same thing is
true for going all wireless.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.265 align:middle line:84%
It is convenience, but
it comes with a cost.

00:24:11.265 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
just brought up

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
something a minute
ago that stands out

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:90%
to me like a sore thumb.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Apple was forced to reduce the
radiation from the iPhone 12.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:84%
That means Apple can
reduce the radiation

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:84%
on every model of
phone, if they wish,

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and so can Samsung and
all the other companies.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: They can.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact an engineer who's
a PhD, James C. Lin,

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I heard him in a
presentation last year.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
He said that phones emit levels
that are likely tens of times

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:84%
too high compared to what they
need to connect to the antenna.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, if we
lowered the power of your phone

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:84%
by five-fold, maybe it
would still be the same.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But why phone manufacturers
don't do that,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and they don't do the same
with their towers that are way

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:84%
too strong for what they need,
the reason they don't do it

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
is because other
competitors don't do it.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's a waiting game.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a
delusion and perception

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.450 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
better, faster service

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:84%
from this guy who's not
lowering the radiation.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: And they're
not following what's

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:90%
called the ALARA principle.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And nuclear radiation
is very clear

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that you want to be exposed to
as little as humanly possible.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.690 align:middle line:84%
ALARA is As Low As
Reasonably Achievable.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a cell
phone tower, in order

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to make it work, you can
lower to level 100-fold,

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:84%
you have to do it
under that principle.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not being done.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:90%
At the moment is anything goes.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And as much as humanly
possible is really

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.293 align:middle line:84%
what the industry is
following right now.

00:25:51.293 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're going
to get to this in a minute.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.650 align:middle line:84%
We've got to take back our
own power literally here.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:90%
This is very, very important.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:84%
People pay close
attention to this

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:90%
and take back their own power.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.347 align:middle line:84%
So looking at 5G
going up everywhere,

00:26:02.347 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
without people's understanding
or even permission,

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.388 align:middle line:84%
most people don't even
know they've just raised

00:26:06.388 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:90%
a new 5G tower right near them.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And then from the
5G tower, they pay

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:84%
people to use
rooftops, church tops,

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, to
rent that space,

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to put the little relay
antennas because it

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.040 align:middle line:84%
has a fairly short signal
hopping from one to the next

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
but very powerful and
potentially very damaging to us

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:90%
as human beings.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And so there has to be a
way to start waking up.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Some small cities have actually
come together and stopped it.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us
just a little bit

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.530 align:middle line:84%
about a couple of places who
have managed to keep 5G out

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.820 align:middle line:90%
of their neighborhoods?

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Yes, there's
a few cities in the US

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.090 align:middle line:90%
that were able to do that.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:84%
But I would say when it comes
to cell phone tower placement,

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:84%
India is one of the leaders
of all the countries.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
In 2012, more than
10 years ago, they

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.390 align:middle line:84%
started dismantling
cell towers that

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.057 align:middle line:84%
were too close to
schools, playgrounds--

00:26:59.057 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT:
--hospitals, and they

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:90%
put in laws that are stricter.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Still the telecoms are
fighting to overrule this,

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:90%
so it's a big fight out there.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:84%
The telecoms would
love every rooftop

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to have an antenna
because it's what

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.840 align:middle line:90%
makes their business great.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:84%
But we have to stop this and
put the cell phone towers away

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.890 align:middle line:84%
from people because
for sure distance

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is a very big factor when it
comes to harm or lack of harm.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And for one thing
that is crazy--

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
laugh about this one--

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:84%
cows in France or cow
farmers won a lawsuit

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.410 align:middle line:84%
over the placement
of a cell tower

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
because you can quantify
how much milk the cows--

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.053 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:27:45.053 --> 00:27:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: --get out.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So the dairy farmers
said, well, my yield

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.207 align:middle line:84%
was 30% lower since you
installed this big tower

00:27:51.207 --> 00:27:52.290 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of my field.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us about
mothers and their babies.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Well, exactly.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So what ended up happening
is that the judges saw,

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:90%
well, there's causality here.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:84%
You install the tower,
the cows have less milk,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and the dairy farmer
is going under.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:90%
He's losing his business.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And they were forced
to move away the tower.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: And
the ironic thing is

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.050 align:middle line:84%
that if you do that with
humans, and you say,

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.130 align:middle line:84%
well, you install the tower,
and now my health suffers,

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.150 align:middle line:90%
it's not as easy.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no, it's not.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really for
those people out there

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:84%
who are extroverts
and born activists--

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:84%
everyone is born with
a purpose in this time,

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.552 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people were born
to activate and take action

00:28:30.552 --> 00:28:32.760 align:middle line:84%
on things that are no longer
working for this planet.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying that because
some of the people watching us

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:90%
are native activists.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of their kids are
growing into activists.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
believe this is one

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.240 align:middle line:90%
of the most important issues.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So we can get our
immune sovereignty

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and our mental and
emotional sovereignty

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:84%
back to stop the bombardment
of these frequencies

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:84%
of the human species, so
calling all activists out there.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Another anecdote,
a friend of mine

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.390 align:middle line:90%
was sleeping across from a bank.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.950 align:middle line:84%
She lived in a densely
populated apartment building.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.090 align:middle line:84%
She had a bank of
smart meters just

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
across the wall from her
head, sensitive person.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
She was nearly dead
when this all happened.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
When it came to my
attention, I hadn't seen her

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:90%
in a while, mutual friend.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.580 align:middle line:90%
She could barely speak.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.830 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't getting out of bed.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:20.982 align:middle line:90%
She had no appetite.

00:29:20.982 --> 00:29:22.440 align:middle line:84%
That's when I found
out-- and we're

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.315 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about a
number of these-- there

00:29:24.315 --> 00:29:25.680 align:middle line:90%
are ways to deal with this.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.570 align:middle line:84%
All of them are
new in development,

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:90%
the last decade or so.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But the one called FLFE, which
I found out about and actually

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:84%
started telling people
about because of her, I

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:90%
heard about it.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Without her knowledge,
I had this technology

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:84%
focused on her apartment
within 30 days.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And I had a mutual
friend talk to her.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And her mind
started coming back.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:50.910 align:middle line:90%
She could complete sentences.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.650 align:middle line:84%
She started getting
a little more energy.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Then she started walking.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Then at the end of 30
days, she was normal.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Her mind was back, and
she was moving furniture.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:90%
That was the only change.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, that particular company--

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:84%
FLFE has scientific studies
done on it out of university

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and a lot in thousands
of anecdotal.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So we know that works,
and it works on a space.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It identifies an
address, and it changes

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
the energy in the space to
knock down those frequencies.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But you know of other
types of technologies,

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.427 align:middle line:84%
too, that people
can use, and I want

00:30:21.427 --> 00:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
you to share them because
we have to do everything

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:24.705 align:middle line:90%
we can to protect ourselves.

00:30:24.705 --> 00:30:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: For sure.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
types of tools

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that we can use to
minimize EMF exposure.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.250 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that I'll say
is that if you have a phone,

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and the phone is
off, that's a tool,

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:84%
lowering the number of
sources we are exposed to.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And we still need to do that
regardless of anything else.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:84%
One of it is distance, having
a distance from your phone.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the 0
millimeter distance.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
issues related to that,

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:84%
so creating distance
from those machines,

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.410 align:middle line:84%
also using the subtle
energy devices.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Many people report
feeling better.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's making
us more resilient to all

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:84%
of these unavoidable
exposures in the environment.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:07.920 align:middle line:90%
So why not?

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Even doctors reminded
me in-- this year

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I've been interviewing
a lot of doctors

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:90%
that treat electrosensitives.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Many patients report feeling
better using certain devices.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:90%
It might be FLFE.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:84%
It might be something
else called biogeometry--

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: --by Dr.
Ibrahim Kareem from--

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes,
he's very good.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: --Egypt.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.700 align:middle line:90%
He's very prominent.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.560 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, some people

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.530 align:middle line:84%
use biogeometry still
bothered by a phone.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me that maybe
it's not a one-size-fits-all.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:90%
So I have--

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have to try them.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:90%
We have to start experimenting.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.045 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: We have to try
different approaches, correct.

00:31:44.045 --> 00:31:47.260 align:middle line:84%
There are also physically
blocking technologies

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.060 align:middle line:90%
that we can use.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, Shield Your
Body is a good company.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.150 align:middle line:84%
They do certain
types of cases that

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.730 align:middle line:84%
will deflect the radiation
away from the body, which

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
is very convenient to especially
people that want to use a belt

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.860 align:middle line:90%
hoister for their phone.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And there are
different technologies

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:90%
like this that are recommended--

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.692 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Will just
block the signal.

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: --that would block
the signal, deflect it away.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:84%
They're not perfect
solutions, but they

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.600 align:middle line:84%
are useful when they
are used correctly.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so most
of it is really--

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.263 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just
talked about the fact

00:32:20.263 --> 00:32:22.680 align:middle line:84%
that there are many people
watching this who are activists

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and can start taking on
their towns and saying,

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.700 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute,
hold on, and can go

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.220 align:middle line:84%
to the church who's earning
however much money they

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.168 align:middle line:84%
would earn a month by putting
one of those antenna on top.

00:32:32.168 --> 00:32:33.210 align:middle line:90%
And churches are always--

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of NGOs, a lot
of different charitable

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:84%
organization headquarters,
they're always short on funds,

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and those are targets
for that industry.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So to start educating
them, this is

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing
to your people,

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:84%
to the people that work
here and congregate here,

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.890 align:middle line:90%
so education and so forth.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But what we're talking
about just a moment ago,

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
these are activist things
we can do for ourselves.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.410 align:middle line:90%
We can bring these in.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And you told me off
camera-- what was it?

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:84%
That the average-- on
average, the average household

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.830 align:middle line:90%
now has how many devices?

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: 23 different
wireless devices.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:84%
However, one of my
colleagues does surveys.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:16.380 align:middle line:84%
He goes to big homes
and with EMF meters,

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes he finds
150 in smart homes.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.740 align:middle line:90%
You have the thermostats.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.140 align:middle line:84%
You have the security
systems, the toaster.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Everything is connected.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.310 align:middle line:90%
These homes are literally sick.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And people call--

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.943 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sick home.

00:33:30.943 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: My colleague-- his
name is Brian from Shielded

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Healing--

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:39.110 align:middle line:84%
he goes there because people
sometimes are in dire need.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:84%
They say, Brian, I have this big
home in Beverly Hills or in LA.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty bad.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
into smart things.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And smart really means EMF.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, EMF,
that's what it means.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: It's kind of
a hidden term right there.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It means sick.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.513 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: It means sick.

00:33:53.513 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So when Brian is
done with them, they

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.670 align:middle line:90%
have wired these technologies.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:02.670 align:middle line:84%
They also have safe
spaces, shielded bedroom,

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:06.500 align:middle line:84%
for example, where you can have
a completely enclosure bedroom.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.469 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have any exposure
from outside cell phone towers.

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
like a safe house.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Pretty much.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to
create your own safe house.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Well, yeah, that's
part of the most advanced

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:17.270 align:middle line:90%
strategies.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's something that works.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Worth considering,
especially where

00:34:20.915 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:84%
you're sleeping, where
your kids are sleeping.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, you live in Montreal.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
It's a densely-- how's
the 5G situation up there?

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.909 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: There's some
5G in downtown areas.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
But personally, I'm just
as concerned about 4G.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: That's the reality.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: The
reality is 5G the way

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.800 align:middle line:84%
it's been explained on the
internet-- and a lot of people

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.160 align:middle line:90%
said 5G is so bad.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:45.960 align:middle line:90%
It's so bad.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.960 align:middle line:90%
It is bad.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.190 align:middle line:84%
However, many towers have 3G,
4G, LTE, 5G antennas on it.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:84%
What is the most
dangerous kind of EMF?

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people ask
me this question.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.010 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is if we
are so focused on 5G,

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and maybe people
watching this at home,

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
they say, oh, I don't have
5G in my town, I'm safe,

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle line:90%
are you safe?

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.460 align:middle line:84%
No, because all the
other technologies

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.680 align:middle line:90%
previously were just as unsafe.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's something
I have to say.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.630 align:middle line:84%
In Montreal, I'm exposed
to much more 4G and LTE.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not good.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And 5G is just adding more
insult to the-- insult already

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.850 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just a
different frequency.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Just a
different frequency.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.238 align:middle line:84%
And there are good
reasons to think

00:35:29.238 --> 00:35:32.423 align:middle line:84%
that 5G is even more dangerous
per unit of radiation

00:35:32.423 --> 00:35:33.840 align:middle line:84%
compared to previous
technologies.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.850 align:middle line:84%
But we need to
think about Wi-Fi.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:84%
We need to think
about Bluetooth.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.870 align:middle line:84%
All of these exposures
are cumulative.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not concerned
about one person

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.280 align:middle line:84%
being exposed to one Bluetooth
thing over five minutes.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:84%
That's not the point and not
even one phone call or one

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.540 align:middle line:90%
day of exposure.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It's over the lifetime.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But people are starting
to lose their resilience

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.770 align:middle line:90%
to this technology.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And it will lower your
antioxidant levels.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It will increase your
oxidative stress levels.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually
for some people,

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.900 align:middle line:84%
it puts them over the edge,
just like your friend.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And fertility rates,
testosterone levels,

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:20.907 align:middle line:84%
the hormonal system, what
have you come to understand

00:36:20.907 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:90%
through all these studies?

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Well, many, many
scientists say that it's been

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.020 align:middle line:90%
crystal clear for years--

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.760 align:middle line:84%
researchers from the
Cleveland Clinic.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I often cite these
mainstream universities

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:33.660 align:middle line:84%
because some people
seem to think

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.330 align:middle line:84%
this is a fringe topic
with fringe scientists

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that are not even published
in peer-reviewed publications.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:90%
This is a lie.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.450 align:middle line:90%
This is a complete fabrication.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But the industry continues
to push this idea that just

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.850 align:middle line:84%
a few handful of
fringe scientists.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.470 align:middle line:84%
No, no, very
mainstream scientists--

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.720 align:middle line:84%
the researchers at the Cleveland
Clinic in their brochures

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.590 align:middle line:90%
in 2010--

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I could go as back as 2010--
they were saying that we should

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.262 align:middle line:84%
preventively not have a phone
in the pocket if you want to--

00:37:02.262 --> 00:37:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you
want to reproduce.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: --conceive
and reproduce.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Because they did
the rat studies.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.710 align:middle line:90%
They did the human studies.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.190 align:middle line:84%
They found that if you
keep a phone in the pocket,

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.230 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a
reduction in fertility.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.750 align:middle line:84%
You also have a reduction
in testosterone.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So the men out there
that say, well, I

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.960 align:middle line:90%
don't want any kids anymore--

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No problem, keep
your phone in your pocket.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there are other
potential ramifications.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.622 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: But if
I tell them, well,

00:37:24.622 --> 00:37:26.460 align:middle line:84%
your testosterone is
going to be hurt, oops.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Right.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people think
about plastics, BPA, BPB,

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh, this is
an endocrine disruptor.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.790 align:middle line:90%
We hear this word.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:39.030 align:middle line:84%
It means hormonal
disruption, endocrine.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.330 align:middle line:84%
The same thing can be
said from radio frequency.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.745 align:middle line:90%
So it's all around us.

00:37:43.745 --> 00:37:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But if it's in
the pocket, you're

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.990 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
disruption there.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:84%
We also have good
reasons to think

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that if we talk on the phone,
you have endocrine disruption

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.010 align:middle line:90%
to the thyroid gland.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, if they
get in a cleaner environment,

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.840 align:middle line:84%
they start having a
thyroid that works better.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So it is just disruption
to any body part

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:04.470 align:middle line:90%
that you want to name.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so our
reproductive systems,

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.550 align:middle line:90%
our immune system--

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.362 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I interviewed a
fellow named Lee Harris.

00:38:12.362 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're
familiar with him.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But he channels a group
called the Zs, which

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.550 align:middle line:84%
have turned out to be pretty
accurate on a lot of things.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we keep
having him back, wonderful.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:90%
And I asked them about EMFs.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, well,
this particular technology

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:84%
is shrinking the human brain
and some of the organs, too.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.795 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what?

00:38:30.795 --> 00:38:33.990 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So anyway, we
continued that discussion a bit,

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.510 align:middle line:84%
but I thought, OK,
we need to take

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.670 align:middle line:84%
this-- that coming
from that source even,

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.650 align:middle line:84%
we need to take this
very, very seriously.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:42.240 align:middle line:90%
So for you, how do you live?

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.310 align:middle line:90%
You live in Montreal.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:90%
You have a little five-year-old.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.280 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: When my
wife was pregnant,

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.470 align:middle line:90%
I brought her the idea that--

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I knew it would not
be well received.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, Jan, maybe we should
stop having Wi-Fi altogether.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Cut down Wi-Fi in
the router and just

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.910 align:middle line:84%
have cables running
down the corridor.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And eventually she said, yeah,
well, I'm pregnant with a kid,

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's a new
feeling for her.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It's something very
precious, very fragile.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Right?

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So the research
on fetuses is not

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:21.710 align:middle line:84%
looking good where it
might impair the brain

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:90%
development, the normal embryo.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And then also miscarriage rates
go up when you're exposed.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So she saw all of it, and she
helped me also publish my book.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So she was aware
of the research.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And since then, we
live without Wi-Fi.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I use my phone, and
it's connected to the antenna.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.340 align:middle line:84%
But in the home, we
don't have Wi-Fi.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And the difference is this, if
you have good Wi-Fi coverage

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.180 align:middle line:84%
in every room in your home, what
is another word for coverage?

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:90%
EMF pollution.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.795 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: You're
bringing it to every room.

00:39:51.795 --> 00:39:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, your neighbors
have a Wi-Fi router,

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
but think about
your own stuff first

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.940 align:middle line:84%
because your own Wi-Fi router
is oftentimes the one that

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:00.940 align:middle line:90%
is closest to your body.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: And my son, when
he was very little and just

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.140 align:middle line:84%
crawling around, would have
been right next to the router

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.040 align:middle line:90%
in our living room.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.780 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't live with that idea.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So I have cables, and I
use my phone with a cable.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I use my computer with a
cable, same thing with my wife.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:19.332 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have anything
else wireless, really.

00:40:19.332 --> 00:40:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: So I
barely use my phone.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.360 align:middle line:84%
When I use it,
I'm at a distance.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
Wi-Fi on my computer.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't use Bluetooth anything.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.500 align:middle line:90%
I took my Bluetooth keyboard.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I sold it to someone else
and the Bluetooth everything.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.670 align:middle line:90%
I used to have Bluetooth.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.840 align:middle line:90%
So I'm human, too.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Before getting into EMFs
seven to eight years ago,

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.820 align:middle line:90%
I had everything Bluetooth.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:90%
I was excited.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I had the router right
next to my computer.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Didn't really realize
these dangers.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But once I knew better,
I had to do better.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So I started
cleaning up my home,

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:59.052 align:middle line:84%
and now it feels like a much
healthier place to live in.

00:40:59.052 --> 00:41:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
it's our habits.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we wake
up in the morning.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.500 align:middle line:84%
People go and get their
little laptop in bed,

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.020 align:middle line:84%
have a cup of tea, and
get on their cell phones

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and check into their emails
and all the news for the day.

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So we start with
the pollution just

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.950 align:middle line:84%
for our own emotional
needs in the morning.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And for people listening to you
are like, oh, no, no, no, no.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
hardwire your computer,

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.195 align:middle line:84%
you can still have at least
a lot of that need met.

00:41:22.195 --> 00:41:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: For sure.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there you go.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: And just
think about where

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:90%
you're spending a lot of time.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Some people tell me things
that are completely--

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.810 align:middle line:90%
seem almost funny to me.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.610 align:middle line:84%
But they say, Nick, I have
this Bluetooth toaster.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:39.930 align:middle line:90%
There's the Bluetooth sign.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Should I change it?

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
how much time do

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.940 align:middle line:84%
you spend in front of
your toaster, right?

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Five minutes, two
minutes, four minutes.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It depends if you want your
toast light or very dark.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost
irrelevant in the sense

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:84%
that you're not spending
a lot of time there.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.430 align:middle line:10%
So just start focusing
on how much time are you

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:57.450 align:middle line:10%
spending in your phone.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:57.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:58.860 align:middle line:10%
>>PINEAULT: How much
time are you spending

00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.850 align:middle line:10%
in front of a computer?

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.770 align:middle line:10%
And for most people
in this day and age,

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.970 align:middle line:10%
it's a lot of hours per week.

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.110 align:middle line:10%
So if you can mitigate your
computer, mitigate your phone,

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.660 align:middle line:10%
you're getting to a
point where you are

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.110 align:middle line:10%
starting to lower that load.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: It's not
avoiding altogether.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:14.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.770 align:middle line:90%
It's like talking about toxins.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.783 align:middle line:90%
OK, start avoiding all toxins.

00:42:18.783 --> 00:42:19.583 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:42:19.583 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good luck.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: I'm
going to go to Mars.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.460 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work on planet Earth.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.530 align:middle line:90%
We are being bombarded.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:26.580 align:middle line:90%
It is polluted.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you start
reducing exposure,

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:31.651 align:middle line:84%
what many people realize,
my resilience is going up.

00:42:31.651 --> 00:42:32.451 align:middle line:90%
My sleep is better.

00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
energy levels going

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: Energy
levels, hormones

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:35.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Immune
systems bouncing back.

00:42:35.915 --> 00:42:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PINEAULT: So in
reality, you have

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.310 align:middle line:84%
to find the point where you
lower EMFs enough that you feel

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.530 align:middle line:84%
good about your exposures
and you feel good

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.520 align:middle line:90%
about your health.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.310 align:middle line:84%
If you are not happy about
your health currently,

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that
when you go camping you

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.450 align:middle line:84%
feel like a much
different person,

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:56.270 align:middle line:84%
there's some work to do
because your environment is

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:57.323 align:middle line:90%
sick at the moment.

00:42:57.323 --> 00:42:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's our metric.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Go camping for a
couple of days and see

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.960 align:middle line:84%
how you do, and then you come
back and make the adjustments.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PINEAULT: Exactly.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can all be
activists in our own lives.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't crying wolf.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.600 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
serious problem that's

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.260 align:middle line:84%
getting more serious literally
by the day, week, month,

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.060 align:middle line:90%
and year.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.670 align:middle line:90%
So, Nick, thank you.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas, thank you so
