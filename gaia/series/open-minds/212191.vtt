00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.900 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: So much
of today's narrative about

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.450 align:middle line:10%
humanity and life on
Earth is nihilistic.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.550 align:middle line:10%
So Lee Harris and I
decided to produce

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:10%
a book on the future of humanity
titled, "The Future Human."

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:10%
This was a channeled
work with the Z's.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:10%
And to say there were surprises
would be an understatement.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:10%
The good news right
off the bat is

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:10%
that we humans will
still be here on Earth

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:10%
and we will be better and better
to one another as time goes on.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:90%
There, spoiler alert, right?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LEE HARRIS: Yes.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Welcome back, Lee.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Hi.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.503 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We were just talking.

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
2014, we did our
first interview here.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yup.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is our
eighth or ninth one?

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.522 align:middle line:90%
And it's been nine years.

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's
wonderful going back,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and if anybody chose to go back
and look at the conversations

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and the evolution of
the conversations with

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
the Z's, and what I was
interested in, what they were

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:84%
interested in, what they were
willing to reveal and such,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:90%
and it just keeps getting more--

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I think more profound and
kind of poignant as time

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
goes on because we're getting
to an interesting point

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Exactly.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:10%
And I think when we did "The
Future Human" recordings,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:10%
of course, you
being you and having

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:10%
your breadth of knowledge and
your own intuition where you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:10%
steer them is so interesting.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:10%
And also, I think I
shared this with you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:10%
on our last conversation
here, something

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:10%
changed around 2019-2020.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think in tandem with how
much more serious world events

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
became in 2020, I noticed
a shift in how much

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:84%
they would speak
about certain topics.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
they're always trying

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
they contribute

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
not to the fear on the
planet but to the evolution

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's always
that fine line but I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
have noticed they have
been far more explicit--

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.645 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They have.

00:01:56.645 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: --about some of
what people refer to as darker

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:84%
agendas or control agendas over
the last three, four years.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And their reasoning
is because it's time

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and because that's there
and it's more evident.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And so actually, we have to have
some level of awareness of that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.745 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
something different.

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:14.545 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Because prior to that,
that was kind of,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.635 align:middle line:84%
they just kept that behind
the veil, so to speak.

00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yes.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so now, they are,
they're being much more bold,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:90%
they're very clear.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there's an agenda.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you are at
the tail end of it.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And so let's talk about that.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:90%
And they've been wonderful.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I loved that they were so
direct during the recording

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
of the book, which
of course, became--

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
it's an audio book
and a written book.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do is one of
the areas that we talked about

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
in the book, and it's
interesting because some of it,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:90%
you don't--

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.430 align:middle line:84%
well, most of it,
you don't remember

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:90%
because you're not there.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:90%
The Z's are there.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And we haven't
finished editing yet.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.165 align:middle line:84%
So when I go to edit, I
will see all the material

00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:84%
but I don't remember
a lot of it.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I remember
a little more than you do

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
because we're both in a
somewhat altered state.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And there were certain areas
and what's going on in the world

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:84%
right now, as you mentioned
2020, prior to 2020 in America,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:84%
we had a huge split
and divide that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.850 align:middle line:84%
became emotionally
charged around

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:90%
our presidential election.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Then we go right
into 2019, 2020,

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
through 20-- early '22 and the
world events of the pandemic.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, here we are and we're
seeing over the last months

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:84%
play out very, very dire
events in the Middle East.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things I wanted

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to get into a
little bit, and I'll

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
talk to the Z's about it in a
bit, is the notion of free will

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
because what's
happening right now

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:84%
is all of these
books, articles, it

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
feels to me like a dark agenda
coming out about the notion.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
People that are
supposed scientists

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.633 align:middle line:90%
saying there is no free will.

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: It's interesting
because you brought that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.810 align:middle line:84%
information to me
several months ago.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't seen those
articles but where

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
it mapped with what
I've heard the Z's

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
last few years is

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:84%
they've said there is
essentially a frequency

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
war or an energetic
battle taking place

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
on the planet
that's been going on

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
in a bigger way the
last six, seven years

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:84%
or in a more obvious way, and
it's really all about the soul

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
makes the human unique.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
We have a certain
emotional energy field,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and we have the soul
in the human body.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're seeing
now from certain camps

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
is this movement to essentially
remove the soul from humanity,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:84%
essentially turn humans
into robots or machines.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
literally, but if you

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:84%
look at how our world has
started to become less organic,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
less about the environment,
even our way of engaging

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
has started to be moved
more through technology

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and less-- in fact,
there have been direct

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
blocking of us being
together as people.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So we're losing a part of that
organic and energetic wisdom

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:90%
that we share.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it's interesting
when you told me

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
about those articles that
were talking about free will

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:84%
doesn't even exist, well,
that's a direct contradiction

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
to what the Z's have
been talking about.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And they say that the power
of the soul and the power

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness
is what gives us

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity as
humanity to shift,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
not just the
consciousness of humanity

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:84%
but the consciousness
of what is taking place

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, how we
operate on this planet,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and cleaning up so
many of the areas

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
that we've all been
either unconscious of

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
or we have been trained
to be unconscious of.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's a super intense time--

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very intense
time, and you're right--

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.592 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: --and complex.

00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --complex, and what
you brought up a moment ago is

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:90%
really important.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:84%
By having a global
pandemic, whatever

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
a person's belief on that
is, one thing is certain,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
it's separated people
from one another.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And it made us very
dependent on technology

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
for about a year, a
year's period of time,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and for the really
intense part of it.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And people start
getting into habits.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:90%
This is very addictive.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.730 align:middle line:90%
Technology is very addictive.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And so now, you have people
pulling away from one another

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and becoming
increasingly dependent

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
on this technology, which has
its own messaging constantly

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
via algorithms that appeal
to us and make us feel good.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So you're only hearing
the reinforcement

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:84%
of what you already like
and your own position.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:84%
No surprise, we became more
and more and more emotionally

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and mentally polarized
from one another

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:84%
when you're being fed just
what you want to hear and never

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.843 align:middle line:84%
have to consider an opposing or
even a neutral point of view.

00:06:37.843 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: It's interesting.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I had a kind of
experiment with this.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.800 align:middle line:90%
It was earlier this year.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was alone for
about five days.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I was traveling,
I was in a hotel,

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and I had some things to
do but mostly, I was alone.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And so technology became
the way I was communicating

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the time.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And I really
noticed a huge shift

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
when I started being out
in the world with people

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:84%
a few days later versus what my
energy field, my consciousness,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and my mind was doing in
those three or four days

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
where I was going between only
technological communication

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and also taking information
in technologically.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was so marked to me.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know so many people,
especially spiritual people

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:84%
or sensitives or lightworkers
who have isolated themselves.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And for years, the
Z's have been saying

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:84%
don't isolate unless you
are recovering or repairing

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:90%
from something.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to be very careful
about how long you isolate for

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and that was a really visceral
experience for me of, oh wow,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:84%
this is how my body, my
consciousness, my mind

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:84%
responds to having a
relationship and relationships

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
through a computer
screen, through a phone

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:90%
versus being with people.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think, like
many, I crave this now.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain level that
technology has given us.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be the
guardians of are we

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
still coming
together with people.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.873 align:middle line:84%
And I also think there is a part
of it that's more complicated.

00:08:03.873 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're in front
of another human being,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:84%
unless you have a really
harmonic relationship

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:84%
with that human being, things
don't always go your way

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
or you hit wounds or you hit--
but if you go to the computer

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and the algorithms have selected
everything you like and agree

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
with, you have a falsely
harmonious existence

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.660 align:middle line:84%
with a computer that's
a little bit like eating

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
food that has no calorific
and nutritional value.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well put.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:90%
That is so true.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to develop
those parts of yourself that

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:84%
contend with any
kind of challenge,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
really, emotional or
mental because you're being

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:90%
spoon fed like we talked about.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is not
being-- you're not able--

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
you're not communicating
with all the subtle energies

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:90%
of a person's field.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.520 align:middle line:84%
All these subtle bodies we
have are multidimensional minds

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
that we have, that's all wiped
out and flattened when it's

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.590 align:middle line:90%
done just through technology.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.795 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're watching
a wonderful podcast,

00:08:55.795 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
it's very different
when you're sitting

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.878 align:middle line:84%
in the room like someone
watching this even.

00:08:59.878 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It's very different as
someone sitting right here

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the energy
coming off of us.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.512 align:middle line:84%
It's fabulous in that
these platforms exist.

00:09:07.512 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk to
the Z's, they're

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:84%
going to talk a little bit about
the wonder of what AI can do.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
What it can do, but
the way it's going

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.667 align:middle line:90%
is big cautionary tales here.

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, and I should
also say that the Z's have

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:84%
multiple times spoken about
the positives of technology

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:90%
and the internet.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.285 align:middle line:84%
And they said like anything,
it has its downsides

00:09:28.285 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and there are things
you have to be aware of.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But they talk about how
the arrival of the internet

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
has created a new level of
psychic field among all of us.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And it has connected
us all in ways.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course, now, we're at a
period where, yet again, there

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.532 align:middle line:84%
are attempts to control
or direct the internet.

00:09:46.532 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:84%
There are certain countries
where that's already happening.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's an interesting topic.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like everything but
there is no one perspective.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think the biggest risk
for all of us right now,

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
we've just seen it with the
events in the Middle East,

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:84%
is thinking there is one
truth and taking your side

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:84%
about that truth and then
trying to annihilate someone

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:90%
who has an opposing truth.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Essentially what
we have done is we

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:84%
have become the war
energy, the very war

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:84%
energy that the Z's
say we are trying

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.462 align:middle line:90%
to purge out of our system.

00:10:18.462 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:90%
We have.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be
my greatest dream

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have
a conversation

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
between the highest
consciousness beings, whatever

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
the issue is of conflict,
the highest consciousness

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:90%
beings on both sides.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And look at how we could
start looking at these issues

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:84%
in a completely new
way and a mature way,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:84%
in a way laced with
historical perspective.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to get
that anywhere on the media,

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.550 align:middle line:84%
right, left, or
even alternative.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't exist.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: It's true.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things with the
whole Cancel Culture Movement,

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that's very tricky sure,
there are some people

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
who have lost their positions of
power or authority or notoriety

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
for very good reason because
of things that they have done.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's
so tricky about it

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
is the way that the media
portrays it is very base

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:90%
and very low vibration.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't we as a
society be looking to

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
in many of those
cases, say, well,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:84%
what do we do to transform the
situation for the person who

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:90%
is now being blamed?

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
The people who suffered, how
do we bring those together?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Or if not together, how do we
give them the right healing

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and how do we as a society
learn and look at this--

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
would be my dream.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: --doesn't
really, as we know,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
there are different
agendas at work.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And so keeping us in a reactive
base war-like frequency

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.415 align:middle line:84%
actually feeds
those other agendas

00:11:38.415 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that are playing out
on a global scale.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.283 align:middle line:90%
So it's a tricky time.

00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It is, because
it would require very deep

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:90%
honesty.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And we've already
been conditioned away

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.662 align:middle line:90%
from any kind of nuance.

00:11:48.662 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, see, look what they said.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:90%
They just admitted it.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Calm down.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, that
would be my dream,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
is to mediate those
conversations.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Heart.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And to me, when
heart is present,

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:84%
so can a higher mind
of heart be present.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:84%
But if the heart isn't
allowed to be present,

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
if compassion, if an open heart,
if softness and vulnerability

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
aren't allowed into
the conversation,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're just supposed to
respond from a very base level

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and fight and blame, then
we don't get anywhere.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's an interesting--
it's almost

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:84%
like we have to move
up the chakras now

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what the
mainstream consciousness is.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are many people
doing that in their own way,

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:84%
doing it for the
planet, meditating.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.113 align:middle line:84%
But it feels like we're
at this moment where

00:12:33.113 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:84%
it's all beginning
to hit the mainstream

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and the question is, how
many people will jump

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:84%
on board with a newer way of
doing things versus get dragged

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:84%
down through fear vibration
into the old way recycling?

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what
they're betting on.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So OK, so before
we get in, let's

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and go to the
Z's in a second here.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get into all of this

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of free
will, the perception that's

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
being proposed that we
don't have free will,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and how that prepares us for
an AI agenda and all of that.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to the
Z's about all of it.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.243 align:middle line:84%
We have so-- there's so much we
talked about in the book about

00:13:10.243 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:90%
AI but we're going to actually--

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do follow-up
questions that I

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%
didn't get to ask in the book.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Great.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:37.795 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.795 --> 00:13:38.595 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Good.

00:13:38.595 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:90%
A pleasure to be with you.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:84%
We are aware that we
are speaking to you

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
from the point of time
that is a major change here

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.620 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
You will not only see evidence
of this change taking place

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
in more dramatic ways
than you have perhaps

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:90%
seen in even recent years.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But more than that,
this is the year

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:84%
where the heart of
the change is born.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So even that which you cannot
see in the externalized world

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
is already being born
in this year of 2024,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
which is the time of
this transmission.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.443 align:middle line:84%
So what many of you
will be experiencing

00:14:14.443 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
as you navigate this and will
have been going through this

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:84%
some of you for the
last year or two

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
is enormous personal
transformation,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
shedding of your own
existing identity that

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:84%
ran along the track of who you
were ancestrally as a humanity.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Many of you are waking
up in more powerful ways

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:90%
than you even thought possible.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Even those of you
who have been what

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
you might call a seeker
or a student for 40,

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
50, 60 years, you are
having experiences

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness that are
far beyond anything you ever

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:84%
thought might be possible
in your lifetime.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are very
close to the veil.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.408 align:middle line:84%
Almost like a
near-death experience

00:14:52.408 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that is happening
while you are still

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
alive in terms of how much
you can tap into not only

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.490 align:middle line:84%
your own higher frequencies
but your oversoul

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and the path of
your soul journey

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:84%
not just here on Earth
but galactically.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:84%
For galactic
consciousness is what

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
is now beginning to merge with
the Earth in this year of 2024.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So we are aware you have
many questions for us

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.970 align:middle line:90%
but we will just say this.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Be very mindful
of how there will

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
be those who want to co-opt
that galactic energy that many

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
of you will be
feeling coming in.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And they will want to present
it to you in a certain way

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:90%
that they have organized.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
A little like the wolf
in sheep's clothing.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
You will be told,
ah, this is galactic.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
you are galactic.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.110 align:middle line:84%
There will be others
who will try and present

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:84%
galactic energy to you as if
it is something that is other.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:84%
They may even try to
get you afraid of it,

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and that will not
just play out in 2024,

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.730 align:middle line:90%
that will run through 2027.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:84%
However, as we have always said,
from 2025 onwards, evidence

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:84%
of increasing new
energy, vibration,

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.548 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly, new
technology developments

00:15:59.548 --> 00:16:01.840 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that will be in
opposition with what you would

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
call the old energy
ways on Earth

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:84%
are going to start to be
even more visible, more seen.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So to recap, many of you
feel quite disoriented.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So you should, it's a
disorienting time on the planet

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:84%
structurally, where the
energy is concerned.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But many of you are
just about to emerge

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:84%
into personally greater
lives than you have ever

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:90%
known as possible.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
challenge for many of you

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
will be to be able to
allow that through you

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
while also and equally holding
deep compassion and awareness

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.450 align:middle line:84%
for the ups and downs that are
going on around you for so many

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:84%
of your loved ones and
indeed the planet as a whole.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who embrace
the next level of yourselves

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and your personal
lives will actually

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:84%
start to direct your attention,
your energy, and your frequency

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:84%
out into the world in
ways that will help lift

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:90%
the vibration of the whole.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:84%
So it's a complex time for
many of you but so many of you

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%
were trained for this
in Atlantean times.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
This time, you
are playing it out

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:84%
in a slightly more human
way but the positives

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
of that technology is
beginning to show in, through,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:90%
and for many of you.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
What a wonderful start
to the conversation.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:90%
One of the things--

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:84%
and welcome, it's good to
have you back in the studio.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:28.889 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Good.

00:17:28.889 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:90%
A pleasure to be with you again.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what I wanted
to talk about is something we

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:84%
actually we touched
on but didn't get

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
to in our conversation
around "The Future Human."

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And because it's coming up I
think as an agenda right now,

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and that is the notion of,
quote, scientists, unquote,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:84%
telling us that we
actually have no free will.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:84%
They have analyzed it,
they've looked at it

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.070 align:middle line:84%
right down to a
level of our neurons,

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and they say, nope,
everything has been

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:90%
predestined and pre-programmed.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:90%
So with that in mind, maybe--

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be an hour-long
discussion for you to explain

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
the nuances of all
of it but let's

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:84%
just take some recent
events, and we could even

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:90%
go further back.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So the things playing
out in the Middle East

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
where people are at
each other's throats

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and definitely
blaming one another

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and taking sides
around the planet,

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
is this something as
a nuance of free will

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that was already known
that was going to occur,

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:90%
that it was inevitable.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of world events,
if you looked at it from,

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:84%
say, an astrological or
numerological point of view,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:84%
can you explain a
little bit of the nuance

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
around what is destined and
what is our free will within it?

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use the Middle
East as an example.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Good.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.230 align:middle line:90%
We will give our perspective.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And as ever, there are
multiple perspectives and ways

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:90%
to see everything.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So depending on your alignment
with our perspective,

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.373 align:middle line:84%
you will either agree
with or reject what

00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:90%
it is we are about to share.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But first things
first, we need to talk

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
about this notion of scientists
and how it is a myth.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you take 10
different doctors

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and you go to them for a
treatment for something

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:84%
you are sick with, you will
get 10 varying opinions.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And you will not like
all of the opinions,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and you will not want to work
with all 10 of those doctors.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:90%
You will choose your alignment.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
You will choose who fits
your belief system, who

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:84%
felt the best energy to you,
and what feels true to you.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.650 align:middle line:84%
There is a weapon that is
brought against all of you,

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
this notion of scientists
as if they are fact.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:90%
That is a complete myth.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, you don't know how
well-educated the scientist is.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, you don't
know what the belief

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:90%
system of the scientist is.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are scientists
who have been corrupted.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Corruption is in every
single area of life,

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and what we mean by corruption
is somebody telling you

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:84%
something that they have
either been paid or threatened

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to tell you so that
it serves an agenda,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:84%
but they are being used
as the front person

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:84%
to make you believe a thing
that isn't necessarily going

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:90%
to ultimately be good for you.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So here, we want to question
this notion of scientists

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:90%
have said.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:90%
A scientist said something.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:10%
Ask yourself, why
did they say it?

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:10%
What led them to say it?

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it truly their belief system?

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Or have they been brought
in to say something?

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, discernment,
discernment, discernment.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
The biggest problem
that is happening

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
on your planet-- and this is
why so many of you feel so off,

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and we don't even mean those of
you who are awake to this, we

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:90%
mean the planet as a whole.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So many of you are being forced
to try and believe a belief.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
thing as a belief.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:84%
There is no unifying
belief on the planet.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Your world is a
multi-dimensional hall

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:90%
of mirrors.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
understand that,

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
you are going to bang your
head on every battle point

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that one person's
opinion throws your way.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
All opinions need
to be held lightly.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:90%
You transform.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:84%
An eight-year-old thinks it's
the worst day in their life

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:84%
because they aren't allowed
to get the toy they want.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
That same human,
when they are 80,

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:84%
has a very different
perspective on what

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:90%
a worst day in their life is.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Beliefs and perspectives change.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Your own will change, and those
around you must be vetted.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is a time where
you have to pay attention

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:84%
to authoritative opinions
being used against you.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So fair enough, some
people believe there

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
is no such thing as free will.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And that may be
their actual truth.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean it is yours.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
There is no provable
fact on Earth, in fact.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are
certain measurements

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:84%
that everyone will agree to but
when it comes to consciousness

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and the soul, it is
far more of a mystery

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:84%
than any human mind or brain
could ever wrap itself around.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Even this channeling that
is coming through Lee,

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
while we have a
fairly pure access

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
to his body, consciousness,
and mind to do this,

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
still there is a
filtration system,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:90%
still there is an influence.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that is
why for some, this

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:84%
channeled information
messages will resonate.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And for others, it will not.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:90%
And that is how it should be.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:84%
None of you should be
forced into believing

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:90%
one thing or another.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:84%
You are a
multi-dimensional planet

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
for a reason so pay attention
when your beliefs are being

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:84%
shut down, when a certain group
is being subjugated, minimized.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
You see how that plays
out all across the planet,

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:90%
and guess what it's good for?

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:84%
When you have certain groups,
roles, genders, identities

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that get
marginalized, abused,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
or oppressed, it serves
to create the fear

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:90%
that it might happen to you.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So that is why ultimately, all
humans who come from oneness

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.460 align:middle line:90%
need to return to oneness.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
This essential idea that you
are actually all equal, no one

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.290 align:middle line:84%
is better than another
person but society

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:84%
may have decided that at
certain moments in history,

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
this person is of superior
value for one reason or another.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, we come to your question
about the Middle East.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it is destined that war
was going to rise at this time

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and you are speaking
about a very historic war.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.420 align:middle line:84%
We will say the flames
have been fanned

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
from so many
different countries,

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
even though the story
you will be told

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is that this is
about two countries

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:84%
having an ancient fight
that has blown up again.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Yet the truth is and this
is something that all of you

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
are learning, all of
your governments, not

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:84%
every single one, they have a
very important interest in war.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And we don't mean that
means that every human who

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
works in government
has an interest in war

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.280 align:middle line:84%
for there are more people
working inside government

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:84%
who are not necessarily
running the same agendas

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.230 align:middle line:90%
that a small group are.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But what you must understand
is war is all about power.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way that an
individual will work hard

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:84%
when they are unconscious
to protect their own power,

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:84%
to protect their
own food source,

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
to protect their
own needs, so too

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:84%
will a country
and its leadership

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.440 align:middle line:84%
while you are still in such a
polarized global culture, where

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:84%
there is this them
and us mentality.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:90%
So was the war destined?

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:90%
We will say two things.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.420 align:middle line:84%
You were destined
to be experiencing

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the ripples of war, particularly
in the year of 2024.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:84%
This was something that was
going to rise to the surface

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:84%
again as a cycle because
the energy template of war

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
was sown into the Earth a very
long time ago and many of you

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:84%
have been here trying
to be peacekeepers,

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and those who are here to
harmonize, to ripple something

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.160 align:middle line:90%
different onto the planet.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But these seeds
run deep and there

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.810 align:middle line:84%
are many agendas
that have decided

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to fan the flames in the Middle
East because it is better it

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:84%
blows up there than
in another country.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
But there were three or
four potentials where

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:90%
this war could have risen from.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why do you say
better it blew up there than

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere?

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Because it serves
the agendas of certain other

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.300 align:middle line:84%
countries who would rather
not get directly involved

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I see
what you're saying.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we spoke during
the recording of "The Future

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Human," you did mention that
we were going to be entering

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
a time and it's going to be--
and maybe you can share with us

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.740 align:middle line:84%
a bit of that
timeline if you can--

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:84%
where war will become truly
obsolete on this planet.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yes, that is what you
are actually working towards.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And it is why there is a
great deal of galactic energy

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:90%
that surrounds the Earth now.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:84%
As we have always said,
there are those of you

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
who believe that
other life forms

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
from other places,
other dimensions,

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.473 align:middle line:90%
are only benevolent.

00:25:55.473 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And there are those of you
who believe the opposite.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And we would say neither
is actually true.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Just as you see on
Earth, there are

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of warring
factions that

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:90%
have played out galactically.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:84%
That is where war
was seeded from.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
War is not actually
a human development.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:90%
It is seeded on this planet.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So what you are seeing is
the horror of most of you

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:84%
on Earth and the
powerlessness that you

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
feel around these acts of
war and these atrocities

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:84%
to your fellow
brothers and sisters

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.900 align:middle line:84%
because you feel powerless
to do anything about it.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is on a
practical physical level,

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:90%
you have been made powerless.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You are not powerless
energetically

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and you are not
powerless vibrationally.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:84%
But this moment in time is
yet another example for humans

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.380 align:middle line:84%
if they choose to see
it, just like they

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:84%
have been seeing in the last
three, four, five, six, seven

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:57.610 align:middle line:84%
years on Earth, how removed
you are from governance

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
as a people, how actually the
game of governance and people

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time was
able to be a little more

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
invisible in how uninclusive
it is of the needs, desires,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and wants of the people.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And right now, you
are very evidently

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:84%
seeing how distorted
and corrupt much

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
of your governmental
influence has become.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Again, we want to qualify here
because as we say these things,

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.275 align:middle line:84%
some of you get very angry
and you want to take down

00:27:25.275 --> 00:27:26.650 align:middle line:84%
all the governments
and you start

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
focusing on all the people
who work in government.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.790 align:middle line:90%
And we would say, mistake.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.757 align:middle line:84%
It's not about most
of the people who

00:27:33.757 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:90%
are working in government.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And there are many in there
who are doing their best

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:90%
to try and improve things.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:84%
It is the heart of
the system itself.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:84%
It is the way that the
system has become structured.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is also certain corporate
interests that have overlapped.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So it is a difficult time
because many humans will say,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.595 align:middle line:90%
well, what can we actually do?

00:27:53.595 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And we will say, well,
there are many of you who've

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:84%
been put on this planet
to dismantle this,

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and you know
exactly who you are,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and you've been doing
it for a very long time.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:84%
You are more than
just whistleblowers.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:84%
There are people who are
positioned right now who

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:10.480 align:middle line:84%
are doing very diligent work
to dismantle from the inside.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But then for most
of the rest of you

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:84%
which is most who
listen to this,

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.690 align:middle line:84%
there are some of
you who are those

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.510 align:middle line:84%
that we spoke of a moment
ago listening to this,

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:84%
for most of the rest of you,
the vibration of who you are

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:84%
becoming, the level of
consciousness of who you are

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:84%
becoming as humans, yes, even
on such a distorted planet when

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:90%
it comes to harmony.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Even on a planet where there
are horrors taking place

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:84%
every single day, there is so
much light and consciousness

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.280 align:middle line:84%
that humans are now able to
access that it is enough of you

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:84%
giving voice, body, and energy
to those frequencies that start

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:84%
to naturally oppose what
we will call the dark ages,

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.630 align:middle line:84%
warlike mentality
that many have been

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:84%
running the show
with for thousands

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.110 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
That is now in its
last ditch attempt

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to try and grasp full
control of the planet,

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and as we have said many times,
that simply is not possible.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.610 align:middle line:84%
However hard they may try and
whatever collateral damage

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.460 align:middle line:84%
may happen along the
way in their attempts,

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
you are at the period of history
where an energetic revolution

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:90%
begins.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.260 align:middle line:90%
That was beautiful.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: We want
to add something.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It is very difficult for us
to speak about this to you

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
without many of you going
into the very fear of what

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:90%
it is we are speaking about.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:46.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to in any way ask
you to judge yourself for that.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.790 align:middle line:90%
We want you to notice it.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:84%
We want you to notice that your
body slightly tightens up when

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.620 align:middle line:90%
we speak about these things.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.120 align:middle line:90%
That is history.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:84%
That is the history
of the soul lifetimes

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:84%
where you have been through
so many cycles on this planet

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.550 align:middle line:90%
and others around war.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Please pay attention to
your own nervous system

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and your own bodily
reaction because the way

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:84%
to create a new
template on Earth

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:84%
is to become mindful
of the part of you that

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
contracts when you hear,
see, or feel information

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:90%
along those lines.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And to work with the part of
you that contracts, release

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
those feelings, let
them through you,

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and then return to the light,
return to consciousness,

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.750 align:middle line:90%
return to recognizing.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.382 align:middle line:84%
Even though you
do not like that,

00:30:32.382 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
even though you wish it were
different on the planet,

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:38.490 align:middle line:84%
you are here to represent
and emit and become

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:39.360 align:middle line:90%
something other.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.860 align:middle line:90%
You will not be it all the time.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.870 align:middle line:84%
You will all have your
light and dark days.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:90%
That is life.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
of you now who

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.040 align:middle line:84%
are working to shed
that dark war template

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.870 align:middle line:90%
reaction from inside you.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is important
work because then you

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.830 align:middle line:84%
will not continue repeating
the same pattern in the years

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So noticing how you react
to the darker frequencies

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
is key for so many of you in
becoming a lighter, brighter,

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:84%
higher frequency
more of the time.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, thank you.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So you were talking a moment
ago about these scientists which

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I now just call them
pseudoscientists,

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.440 align:middle line:84%
the ones who perpetuate
this kind of information

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.230 align:middle line:84%
because theirs is just a
science of belief or agenda.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.090 align:middle line:84%
This is no longer
linked to anything

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that's provable, so to
speak, and it does not

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:33.082 align:middle line:90%
allow for soul at all.

00:31:33.082 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And science
cannot measure the soul.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.998 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They cannot.

00:31:35.998 --> 00:31:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: They can provide
a few pointers but it simply

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.330 align:middle line:84%
cannot measure the soul because
there is no science required

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:43.380 align:middle line:90%
to measure the soul.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.140 align:middle line:84%
The soul has its
own cosmic science.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to open to the
soul to understand the soul.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Many of these scientists
who are studying the soul

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.230 align:middle line:84%
are trying to disprove
something that they have never

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.070 align:middle line:90%
experienced.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So how on earth if they cannot
get inside the very thing they

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:01.320 align:middle line:84%
are trying to
measure, how can they,

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and why would they try and
spend their life disproving it?

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:84%
A far better use
of their time would

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.120 align:middle line:84%
be to engage in trying
to embrace and become

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.382 align:middle line:90%
it, and see for themselves.

00:32:10.382 --> 00:32:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not a
surprise that most

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
of the people that do this
particular kind of science

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.130 align:middle line:84%
or pseudoscience are completely
atheistic in the sense

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're neurochemicals
and we're cells and meat.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.693 align:middle line:84%
And so for everyone
watching this,

00:32:25.693 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:90%
they know that doesn't work.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is
a large percentage

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:84%
of the population can still be
swayed by this pseudoscience

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:84%
as it's getting and has
been getting so much

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.980 align:middle line:84%
press lately this notion
of lack of free will.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It's coming into some of our
entertainment and programming

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.680 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And so part of this also
the same group of people

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:84%
have convinced us that we're
naturally warring by nature,

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that humans are naturally
competitive and violent and

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.830 align:middle line:90%
warring by nature.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about, A, if you
can, who seeded that on Earth?

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:03.510 align:middle line:84%
What group or what beings
seeded the notion of war

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and then these kinds
of puppeteering agendas

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.773 align:middle line:90%
that are playing out right now?

00:33:08.773 --> 00:33:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not
important for us to know

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.132 align:middle line:84%
exactly what an identity
is, the nature of the group

00:33:13.132 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and what they're trying
to achieve out of this,

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:middle line:90%
and when they're going to stop.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, firstly, we
will say to you that anyone

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.420 align:middle line:84%
whose agenda is to try and
disprove something else that

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.900 align:middle line:84%
someone believes, they
are in a war mentality.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Why spend your life trying
to disprove something

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that someone else can
tell you they experience?

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So many of them are the
reincarnated witch-hunters,

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:84%
other forms of role
on the Earth where

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:84%
they were brought in
to essentially oppose

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.890 align:middle line:90%
or war against spirit.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:90%
So that is the first thing.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the part about
how was war seeded,

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:84%
who was war seeded by,
the Earth a long time

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.590 align:middle line:84%
ago was very underpopulated
compared to what you see now.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So there were less beings on the
Earth, and the Earth was not,

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.700 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, dimensionally
organized the way it is now.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:84%
Many of you have helped to
create through your lifetimes,

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:84%
not you particularly who
are incarnate right now,

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.290 align:middle line:84%
although some of
you would have been

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:84%
incarnate in other lifetimes
going back thousands of years,

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.100 align:middle line:84%
you have helped to
create what the Earth is.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.679 align:middle line:84%
So what we mean by this is
many of you have been born

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:84%
onto the Earth in this lifetime
and told this is what Earth is,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.909 align:middle line:84%
this is what this country is,
this is what the ocean is,

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:33.170 align:middle line:90%
this is what the land is.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But what we can tell you
is that every few hundred

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.179 align:middle line:90%
years, the Earth has changed.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And the way that people
perceive, experience,

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and engage with the Earth
is very different in each

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.480 align:middle line:90%
of those iterations.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.020 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is
your history starts

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.230 align:middle line:84%
to get rewritten so that
you can make people believe

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.850 align:middle line:90%
and understand certain things.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:84%
It's why people get up in
arms about other dimensions

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.380 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.960 align:middle line:84%
There are those
who firmly believe

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and have experiences about
what's going on inner Earth.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are
those who when they

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
hear about different dimensions
of reality and places

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.210 align:middle line:84%
where people are
living in inner Earth,

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:84%
they think these
people are insane.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet the truth is
there are different ways

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.150 align:middle line:90%
of experiencing the Earth.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:84%
We said earlier, it's a hall
of mirrors, and we meant it.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.180 align:middle line:84%
How you see the
Earth dimensionally

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:84%
affects what you
actually experience.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So the war was implanted
here because a long time ago,

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Earth was seen as a
planet that was going

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.300 align:middle line:90%
to be one of great evolution.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.760 align:middle line:84%
There was an idea
that you could create

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.890 align:middle line:84%
what we will call a--
what you might call

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:44.300 align:middle line:84%
a superhuman but a being
that in your physical terms

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.150 align:middle line:84%
would be at least
12-foot tall or more

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and would be a light
being with a human body

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.330 align:middle line:84%
but an elongated human
body to what you know now.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.840 align:middle line:84%
That was the idea of a
certain race who wanted

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:90%
to seed that here on Earth.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
there was a war

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:06.020 align:middle line:84%
for this planet that was going
on in a way that was, shall we

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.040 align:middle line:90%
say, energetic in nature.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:90%
It was not a physicalized war.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.630 align:middle line:90%
It was a very advanced war.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And so during that
period of time,

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.460 align:middle line:84%
what we refer to
as a "clamp" was

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.683 align:middle line:84%
placed on Earth
and the possibility

00:36:18.683 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:90%
of the development of Earth.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.950 align:middle line:84%
The idea was that
the human could

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:26.040 align:middle line:84%
evolve very fast into this what
we will call super human being.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:84%
But that clamp stopped
this from being allowed.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
the clamp works is

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
to keep the human
being in all of what

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:84%
you might call the lower chakra
limitations, to not allow

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.170 align:middle line:84%
them to open up the higher
chakras in a way that then

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:43.800 align:middle line:84%
permeates through
the energy field.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.452 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if someone
opens their third eye,

00:36:46.452 --> 00:36:48.410 align:middle line:84%
meaning they start having
psychic and visionary

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:52.190 align:middle line:84%
experiences, if they are capable
of going with that opening,

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:middle line:84%
it will start to flood every
other part of their being.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:90%
It will open their heart.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.203 align:middle line:84%
It will open their
other chakras.

00:36:58.203 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:84%
It will start to
illuminate their being.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But because you have
all been trained

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:06.710 align:middle line:84%
in such compartmentalized
logical and, if you like,

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.740 align:middle line:84%
boxed ways as to how
you are as human beings,

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.050 align:middle line:90%
often you stop at the third eye.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.232 align:middle line:84%
You open your intuition,
your psychic development,

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.190 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know how
to take it into the body

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's no one's fault other
than the training on Earth

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and the clamp that
we speak about.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So there was a time when
Earth was going to be,

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, used
by a certain race.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And that war did not come to
fruition but the seeds of war

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.700 align:middle line:84%
that were planted
here and that what

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.450 align:middle line:84%
we will call "takeover" that
was never able to happen,

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
it left the seeds of war that
other races could co-opt.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And two of them did,
and they are still,

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:49.070 align:middle line:84%
in many ways, influencing Earth
and having their own war that

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.170 align:middle line:84%
is completely separate to
what is going on in humanity.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And so as we give you all of
this information, what's tricky

00:37:55.610 --> 00:38:00.080 align:middle line:84%
maybe for you to grasp
is this sounds ludicrous

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.120 align:middle line:84%
or it doesn't sound true or
it sounds more complicated.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, because
you have been so far

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:84%
removed from this history
that it doesn't always

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:09.750 align:middle line:90%
make sense to your mind.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:90%
But here is the bigger point.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Many of you are now
remembering and not the facts

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that we are speaking about
here, and again, those

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.910 align:middle line:84%
are facts that only certain
people will believe or align

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.850 align:middle line:84%
with because everything
is a hall of mirrors

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.050 align:middle line:90%
and a perspective game.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But there are many of you
who are beginning to realize

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.400 align:middle line:90%
your galactic origins.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's why for periods
of time, many of you

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:84%
were so interested
in off-world events.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you were
interested in off-world events,

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.020 align:middle line:84%
it's that you were
remembering that you also

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.300 align:middle line:84%
are an off-worlder in another
time and in another dimension.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So you are slowly cycling
through this evolutionary dance

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.140 align:middle line:84%
where you get to
not only come back

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to the origin of when and
how and why war was seated

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
but you also start

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.720 align:middle line:84%
to create an energy
field in yourself

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:84%
as humans that will, in
fact, repel and purge

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that war template that
was sown on Earth.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:84%
We say it will take quite
a while to get there,

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.530 align:middle line:84%
but this war in the
Middle East that you

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.550 align:middle line:84%
focus for this
conversation is a big part

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:84%
of humanity's shift in
awareness and desire

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.725 align:middle line:90%
and tolerance around war.

00:39:19.725 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And so going to taking
it from the macro view

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that you just gave
us, so those who

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.260 align:middle line:84%
have co-opted this
agenda for clamping

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and are perhaps even influencing
us greatly through technology,

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
AI, algorithms, and
so forth at this time,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:84%
seems like it's almost the
last playing field to co-opt

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.240 align:middle line:84%
the mind, co-opt the sense that
we have sovereignty, free will,

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and connection to one another.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.680 align:middle line:84%
How are those forces
feeling right now

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.632 align:middle line:84%
with the awakening of people
occurring on the planet?

00:39:54.632 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: More nervous
than you would believe.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But then nervousness does
not show up emotionally

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:84%
for they are not emotional
the way humans are.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:06.460 align:middle line:84%
There is a race for some of
them to preserve their own life

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and their own, what
you would call,

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:10.960 align:middle line:90%
line as well as livelihoods.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And that race is very
primal inside them.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.310 align:middle line:84%
That desire to preserve
is a very primal instinct.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have, we
will say, through the ages

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:26.900 align:middle line:84%
lost more of what we would
call desired humanity.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.730 align:middle line:84%
For part of the
attraction to being

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:84%
on Earth was there were
energies seeded here that

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.210 align:middle line:84%
would create this, we will
say, emotional superhuman.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:39.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't mean emotional as in
lots of crying and feeling.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.510 align:middle line:84%
We mean emotional
on a sensory level.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons that you
are a very emotional set

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:84%
of creatures is because your
sensory and intuitive nature is

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.960 align:middle line:90%
what we will call "blocked."

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So everything goes
into big deep emotions

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.690 align:middle line:84%
that run through the
central core of your body.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.450 align:middle line:84%
That is not what you
are designed to be.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:03.260 align:middle line:84%
That level of what some of
you will jokingly or sometimes

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:07.050 align:middle line:84%
judgingly call "human
drama" is, in fact,

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.380 align:middle line:84%
the human impulse
system that isn't

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.710 align:middle line:84%
able to become the sensory
intuitive fully-fledged being

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.010 align:middle line:84%
that the super human you
is designed to become.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So where you get
arrested emotionally

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:23.540 align:middle line:84%
is part of what you might call
the ups and downs of life,

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.460 align:middle line:90%
but many were attracted to this.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So this specific race
that we are speaking of,

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.780 align:middle line:84%
in fact, there are two
who are in competition

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, there
are other interests, too,

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.610 align:middle line:84%
because Earth is a
primary planet right now.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Earth is a planet
that still holds

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.520 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of consciousness
and enlightenment potential.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And unlike those of
you who are humans

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.300 align:middle line:84%
who want to see that
come to fruition,

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.030 align:middle line:90%
that is an energy generator.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they are feeding
off that energy.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:84%
They want to siphon the
energy that is generated.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Much like you would speak of
solar power or other sources

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:84%
of new energy,
there is an energy

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that those beings
want to feed off

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.390 align:middle line:90%
in the rise of consciousness.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
successfully feed off it,

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:10.250 align:middle line:84%
they have to first
trap and contain it.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:84%
They can't feed off
it if it becomes

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:16.730 align:middle line:84%
more powerful than their level,
which is the decade that you

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:18.050 align:middle line:90%
are now in.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the original
template to create this

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:84%
superhuman, one of the things
we talked about quite a bit

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.250 align:middle line:84%
in the book but we don't
have time to talk about now,

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:34.100 align:middle line:84%
is that our way of using mind
is moving into the heart.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:84%
This is against
all those agendas

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.120 align:middle line:84%
that are being perpetuated,
against humanity and the AI

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.740 align:middle line:90%
influence on humanity.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So people can read the book or
listen to the book for that,

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.700 align:middle line:84%
but are we ultimately
going to end up

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:54.060 align:middle line:84%
in some form of this
what you call superhuman?

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: In your lifetime,
it is going to depend

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.090 align:middle line:90%
on the individual.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:59.190 align:middle line:84%
There are many of you
who will become that

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.260 align:middle line:90%
and already are in many ways.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But you will not
in your lifetimes

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.570 align:middle line:84%
see the entire
population become that.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.960 align:middle line:84%
We should clarify the two
most important energies

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.780 align:middle line:84%
for you right now are
heart and intuition.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
mean intuition

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.020 align:middle line:90%
being able to predict.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.920 align:middle line:84%
We mean intuition, your sense,
your ability to discern,

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.880 align:middle line:84%
your ability to feel truth,
rather than let your mind tell

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.180 align:middle line:84%
you what the truth is because
someone else has told you it.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
You spoke earlier about
people who are easily swayed.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:33.090 align:middle line:84%
There are two reasons
people are easily

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.480 align:middle line:84%
swayed by someone else's
mind because they don't know

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.780 align:middle line:84%
their own mind, because they
haven't been able to experience

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the sovereignty to discover
who they are, what they are,

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:90%
why they're here.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Or, they are swayed
because it completely

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:48.060 align:middle line:84%
fits what feels most
comfortable to them.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So they are being backed up
by this person's opinion.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But to your point
and your question

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:58.060 align:middle line:84%
here, the heart
and the intuition

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.420 align:middle line:84%
are the two most important
areas of development

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:84%
in the coming years and
decades for you as a humanity.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It is why you are
being steered away

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:11.690 align:middle line:84%
from so many of those energies
in many different ways.

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It is why you also have a
certain level of organization

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:16.420 align:middle line:90%
around your heart.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.250 align:middle line:84%
You see, the way
to keep people away

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.980 align:middle line:84%
from the greater level
or power of something

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:24.250 align:middle line:84%
is to tell people
what it is, tell them

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:26.960 align:middle line:84%
how they can experience
it, and then limit its use.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So there is a great
celebration of kindness.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.970 align:middle line:84%
We will give you
an example here.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.770 align:middle line:84%
To go back to the
war agenda and how

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.243 align:middle line:84%
it moves through your
competitive shows,

00:44:35.243 --> 00:44:37.660 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about your television
shows that so many of you

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.770 align:middle line:90%
are focused on.

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:41.420 align:middle line:84%
There are these contests
that take place,

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:43.870 align:middle line:84%
whether it is dancing,
whether it is singing.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And many of you are focused
on the emotional side

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.300 align:middle line:84%
of those shows but there are
still winners and losers.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.950 align:middle line:90%
War is sewn into it.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So you see, you are given that
taste of what it is you crave,

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.530 align:middle line:84%
which is connection,
emotion, heart.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But you are also fed a winner
and loser competitive side.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.770 align:middle line:90%
So it is always limited.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So the heart and intuition that
are coming online for so many

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:12.100 align:middle line:84%
of you right now is so important
because those are the areas

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that cannot actually be touched
but you can stop somebody from

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.810 align:middle line:84%
opening to those if you
sow enough fear and control

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:22.480 align:middle line:90%
into them and their life.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Hear, hear, thank
you so much for sharing that

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:90%
at the end.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not,
we've barely started,

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.090 align:middle line:90%
we're out of time.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you so much for
adding even more to the hours

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and hours of conversation
we had recently that created

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.360 align:middle line:90%
"The Future Human."

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.985 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: There is
no need for thanks.

00:45:40.985 --> 00:45:41.840 align:middle line:90%
It is our pleasure.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for your facilitation
and to all who are tuning in.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.030 align:middle line:10%
We know it is a
precarious time on Earth

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:10%
and it can be heavy
on your hearts.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:53.080 align:middle line:10%
But understand all
of you came here

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.140 align:middle line:10%
for a mission, a mission of
light, consciousness, love.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:10%
And some days, you will
be out of touch with that

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.880 align:middle line:10%
and you will only be in
touch with your humanity.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.680 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing wrong
with being in touch

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.680 align:middle line:84%
with your humanity, it is the
way through which many of you

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.050 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing
your enlightenment.

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But remember, if
your vibration drops,

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.480 align:middle line:84%
if a person or a
piece of information

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:18.010 align:middle line:84%
makes your vibration drop,
pay attention and reset.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:21.470 align:middle line:84%
That is how you keep
yourself clean, clear,

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:24.345 align:middle line:90%
and powerful in these times.

00:46:24.345 --> 00:46:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.553 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: In peace and in love.

00:46:26.553 --> 00:46:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Welcome back.

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Thank you.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We're out of time.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Seemed so quick.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh my god, it
felt like five minutes.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:39.850 align:middle line:90%
It just flew.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Lot of good information
from the Z's as always.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And there were
some wonderful kind

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.360 align:middle line:84%
of knock-ons from
the conversation

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.570 align:middle line:90%
we had in the book as well.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think people
will have a chance

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:52.550 align:middle line:84%
to kind of see what the genesis
of some of those questions

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:53.350 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful information,
very powerful.

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Great.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Lee, thank you so
much for lending yourself to us

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:00.890 align:middle line:90%
once again.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:02.290 align:middle line:90%
So this is what, eight or nine?

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We'll see you and we'll see
you on book-- on show 10

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:06.160 align:middle line:90%
with another book.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you, my dear.

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:10.480 align:middle line:10%
The book's title is
"The Future Human,"

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.570 align:middle line:10%
and we'll both be delighted to
hear your thoughts after either

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:15.130 align:middle line:10%
reading or listening
to the book.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:18.580 align:middle line:10%
There's so much to engage with
there and chew on in its pages.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.830 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.230 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."
