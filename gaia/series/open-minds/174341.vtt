00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:19.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We've all heard

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.050 align:middle line:10%
of the effectiveness of
mind over matter meditations

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:10%
and exercises, but
how many of you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:10%
have ever thought that it
could be body over mind that

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.780 align:middle line:10%
could heal us?

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
We think somehow
the body is less

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
knowledgeable than the
mind, but Bill McKenna says

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:90%
we're in for a big surprise.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:90%
And welcome back, Bill.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:84%
You're always
searching, and you just

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:84%
have these amazing epiphanies
that pop through in your mind.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.094 align:middle line:84%
And then you start playing, and
then you start experimenting.

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Then you start kind of
doing your own research

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.265 align:middle line:90%
and find, oh, my god, it works.

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BILL MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
I thought we'd do,

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
because it's been a
while, so for those

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.572 align:middle line:84%
who didn't see my first
interview with you,

00:00:58.572 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
you can always go back and
watch the first interview,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:84%
but I thought we'd go ahead
and just kind of bring people

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:84%
back through where you've been
on the whole healing process,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the healing work
that you've shared with others.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.014 align:middle line:84%
You're a very humble
kind of teacher.

00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And so first of
all, we're talking

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.140 align:middle line:90%
about frequency and dimension.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's just kind of
start with where

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
we are in the third
dimension and what

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:84%
our challenge is with healing in
the third dimension, as a rule.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: I just
shared the aspects

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:10%
that comprise these
different, called dimensions

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:10%
or frequencies.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:10%
In the third dimension, there's
laws, rules, regulations, yours

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:10%
and mine.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:10%
The focus happens to be on
either the past or the future,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:10%
and our ego plays
into this wonderfully,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:10%
because it has
these three modes.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
It wants, either it wants,
it's not getting what it wants,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
or it's indifferent.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And this, when
we're in that realm,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:84%
we have very little ability to
actually have mind over matter.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything is done
through force,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:90%
force of will of some kind.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or subconcious
programs running.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Subconcious--

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They just take over.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yes,
exactly, because that's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
what's in the present moment
is those subconscious programs

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:90%
are taken over in.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
In the third dimension, it's
the home of conditional love.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Everything's conditional.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth dimension,
unconditional love emerges,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and our ego becomes
kind of neutralized.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
The focus becomes
on the present,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and this wonderful ability
of mind over matter

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:90%
starts to emerge.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So this-- the last time
that we interviewed

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
was the what I would call
extreme mind over matter.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And in this session, what
I want to share with you,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
the epiphanies that took
place are no less extreme

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:90%
and that is the body over mind.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.855 align:middle line:90%
So what ended up happening--

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me ask
you one question--

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Go ahead, sure.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --before we get going.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It has to all be coming from the
same place ultimately though.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.542 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about the notion of--

00:03:17.542 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
last time we talked about
the fourth dimension,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
where love is
unconditional, and where you

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:90%
can kind of do a phase shift.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Time doesn't act the same.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything is present and now
so you can do instant healing.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So before we go into this
next part of your epiphany

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and your research and such,
isn't this fourth dimension

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:90%
still playing--

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
or another dimension
still playing

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
into the healing process,
even though the way we're

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:90%
accessing it is different?

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, Yes.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
We're accessing it
through the body,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
but as you'll see in what
I'm going to talk about,

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing because
you actually feel it.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it
energetically in the body.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about like,
oh, you've got to be woo-woo

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:84%
or you've got to be something,
some ascended master

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:90%
type being.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Is everyday Joe Schmo,
who doesn't know anything

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
about anything actually
experiences this in their body

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:90%
as an energy.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it has that
same complement in that

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:90%
it has a timelessness to it.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:84%
You're getting
results very quickly

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.010 align:middle line:84%
in real-time like you were with
your other healing modality.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
little different,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:84%
but I mean, it's
still happening now.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It's happening very
fast, extraordinarily fast.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The results are fast, some
faster than others, but it sure

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.810 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect it.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's do the set up.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So you were thinking
about something.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So kind
of like before,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
kind of the pieces
of the puzzle--

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
how to describe this,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
but kind of a lifetime
of pieces of the puzzle

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
just all the sudden
kind of came together.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And they seem so disparate
as they're happening.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
The first one was my experience
with what's called a labyrinth,

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So a labyrinth-- they're
all over the place.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Had you
walked a labyrinth

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's what got
you thinking about it?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: There was this
amazing, wonderful, very

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.190 align:middle line:84%
wise person that kind of
introduced me to a labyrinth,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
but they did it in a
different way, right?

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of those things
can seem very woo-woo.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:84%
What they said was, labyrinths
are just the most practical

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:90%
problem-solving tool.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And the way it works
is you come in,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter if
it's your carburetor--

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I want to know how
to fix my carburetor

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:84%
or why is my son
have this issue,

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
or why is my job not
producing the money I need,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But you walk in
with the problem,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and you walk in
with the intention

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
of kind of thinking
about the problem

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:90%
as you probably normally do.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk in,
you're physically

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:90%
forced to turn to the left.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
You walk a few more
feet, you're physically

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
forced to turn a
U-turn to the right,

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.849 align:middle line:84%
and this goes on
for a mile or so.

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But it does not-- because
it's in a little circle

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
back and forth, it

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
doesn't seem like
it's that long.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
You focus and you're
thinking about the problem,

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and all of a
sudden, what happens

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
is you get a new idea, a new
resolution, and why is that?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And the way she explained
it was quite simply,

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
you're used to solving
problems with one

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
half of your brain, the logical
end or the creative end.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
We lean more towards
one or the other.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, when
you do that U-turn,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:84%
you get physically forced
into the opposite hemisphere

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm over here on the
left-hand side, real logical--

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Making a
right-hand hand turn.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: So yeah.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, as you're
going through the labyrinth,

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
you're like, oh, I
could do it this way.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.345 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I could do it that way.

00:07:28.345 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Huh, never thought
of that before.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.505 align:middle line:90%
But it's so natural.

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're getting
whole brain activation,

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting that synaptic
activity between hemispheres,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:90%
so boom, it's all lit up.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.459 align:middle line:84%
It would be very interesting
to see an MRI of that, right?

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, it sure would.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:90%
See what's lighting up and--

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.205 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So as
a practical tool,

00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:84%
you can utilize labyrinth
to solve problems.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:90%
They're free.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the world.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Labyrinthlocator.com is free.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:84%
5,500 labyrinths across the
world, 90 countries, and you

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
could just walk into
pretty much any one of them

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.433 align:middle line:90%
and just start using them.

00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:10.727 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Labyrinthlocator.com.

00:08:10.727 --> 00:08:11.527 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:08:11.527 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, awesome.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.195 align:middle line:84%
When people walk a labyrinth,
the other interesting thing

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
is that they find
this kind of peace.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that they find
the piece is because they're

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
usually in stress,
and then, as they

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
walk the labyrinth,
one half of the time,

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.180 align:middle line:84%
they're over in the right-hand,
that right hemisphere

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.980 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:84%
The stress is over on the
left half of the brain.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So voila, it's
pretty simple, right?

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first
experience with,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:84%
you know what, my body
can impact my mind

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.356 align:middle line:90%
and help me process something.

00:08:49.356 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
By the way, if you ever
walk one of the labyrinths,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I recommend getting a sheet
of paper or maybe your phone

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and make a note, because
the thoughts come so fast,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.920 align:middle line:90%
and you forget.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:84%
They're so fleeting,
and you can--

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:90%
you want to make a note.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You probably have your
iPhone in your pocket and you

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:90%
just--

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Make a note.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, make a note of it.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Memo.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what I had to do.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:90%
So that was my first--

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:90%
my first experience with this.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
The other-- I had a
series of things, right?

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So I got exposed to this light
therapy, which I know you do.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:10%
And for certain
people, right, they

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:10%
get exposed to a light,
color, and this color

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:10%
ends up affecting their
chakras, in these energy

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:10%
centers in your
body, and they'll

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.600 align:middle line:10%
end up actually feeling it,
which I thought was amazing.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The other real interesting thing
that I ran into, and this was

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
in-- because I've studied
kind of multiple different

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:90%
modalities of processing stuff--

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.810 align:middle line:90%
PSYCH-K, what they'll do is--

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:84%
eyes up to, say, high left
or high right and they

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:90%
go cross-body.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:90%
They go tapping cross-body.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:84%
He has great success,
practitioners all over,

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Rob Williams.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, my gosh, yeah,
yeah, really successful.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
But this cross-body
movement is--

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and I learned about
it from multiple--

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%
it's not the only one, right?

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
There's Brain Gym, which
is super successful,

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.410 align:middle line:90%
where they do cross-body stuff.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
things about cross-body,

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.002 align:middle line:84%
basically it was
crawling, right?

00:10:33.002 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Crawling.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
crawl as a child,

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
you go from just sitting
to standing and walking,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:84%
you miss a development
stage and that causes--

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:90%
a sign of emotional problems.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.346 align:middle line:90%
There was a--

00:10:48.346 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think there's
a crawling therapy.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, there is.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's the one.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.180 align:middle line:90%
There's crawling therapy.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you google
"crawling therapy."

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But one of my
favorite stories is

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.380 align:middle line:84%
there's this law
firm in San Diego,

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and all the lawyers were kind
of out of sorts emotionally,

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and somehow, one of the
head guys, thought of,

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put my
whole entire office

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
through this crawling
therapy, and he did.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing
that I just thought

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
was so funny is one of the
lawyers was in court, in trial.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been going through
the crawling therapy,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.021 align:middle line:84%
and then all of
sudden, he's, mm-hmm.

00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
He just started
sucking his thumb.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I was like--
[LAUGHS] Another one

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
wet his bed, because they had
to go through the processing

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, our body
actually affects our mind.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So one day I got the idea,
and I was like, I had-- oh,

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
super huge important thing
that's super effective

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:84%
is Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprograming, EMDR.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I got exposed to this
several years back,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and I had worked with
probably over 1,000 people,

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:90%
helping him through.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you what,
basically another huge epiphany

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:84%
that our body can force the
programming of what our mind

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:90%
cannot.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
the person focuses

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:84%
on a problem and a trauma and
then they move their eyes left,

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And they've had phenomenal
success, so much success

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that it's been adopted
by the World Health

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Organization, United States
Department of Defense,

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the Veterans Administration
for post-traumatic stress

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:90%
disorders.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about,
they've done studies

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
on this between, whatever
study you look at, 84% to 100%,

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:90%
three sessions, PTSD, boom.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very
effective, yes.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And we so
badly needed this,

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.416 align:middle line:84%
and this is like an
amazing, amazing therapy.

00:12:56.416 --> 00:12:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But again, you're
getting the same thing going,

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:90%
right, left, right, left.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it has right-left.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So kind of one day, I
just thought to myself,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.475 align:middle line:84%
I wonder, I wonder if- I had
also, studying the brain,

00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at one
of these diagrams,

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed the right
hemisphere of the brain notices

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
three-dimensional objects and
where they're at in time/space.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And the left
hemisphere of our brain

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.558 align:middle line:90%
notices colors and symbols.

00:13:35.558 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I was like, mm,
mm, I wonder if--

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:90%
So I was like in the color--

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:84%
from the color
therapy, I noticed

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:84%
that had an effect
on the chakras.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:10%
So I said, ah, there's
something here.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:10%
Put them together.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:10%
And I did.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
When I said, OK, I'm going
to design a ball, three

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
dimensional object, colors of
the chakras and the symbols,

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to throw
it left and right.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:90%
So I did it.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
It's a brilliant idea.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Well, I didn't know--

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
first of all, when I
did it, what I did--

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:84%
it was literally-- literally,
I was like, I called a friend,

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:84%
a personal friend, because
I was like, you know,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this is going
to work or not, and I can't--

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
so I call my friend, and I
say, hey, man, can you help me?

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.231 align:middle line:84%
I just need you to
focus on an issue.

00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
I've got something new to try.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it'll
work or not, OK?

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So this particular friend had
a problem with a family member

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:84%
that had been
going on for years,

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and on a scale of one
to 10 it was an eight.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:49.970 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I want you to--

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.692 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw
you the ball, and I'm

00:14:56.692 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:84%
going to throw it
left, right, and I just

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
want you to see the
color and say the color.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.522 align:middle line:84%
And just stay focused on this
family member, and that's it.

00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do nothing.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:90%
Just focus on them.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:90%
They're wrong.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
You're right, and they're a
bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to remind you
that they're a bah, bah, bah,

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:90%
bah.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
OK boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, seven minutes

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Seven minutes, and he is like,
my belly button is heating up.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It literally, this
would be for those--

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:84%
it's a chakra, right, but
it's a belly button to him.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And it heated up and
then he started sweating.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.567 align:middle line:84%
Another four minutes,
keep doing it, right?

00:15:40.567 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Another four minutes,
all of a sudden,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:84%
he's like, I've got pain
in my chest, my heart area.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.035 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going.

00:15:48.035 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, and it's

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.416 align:middle line:90%
like, he starts coughing.

00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
[COUGHING] It's like up in
his throat, and then it like,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:90%
whoosh, boom, gone.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, so
how do you feel?

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I don't
feel anything.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like EMDR, I
don't feel anything,

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.460 align:middle line:84%
but it also had an
effect through his body.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.672 align:middle line:84%
And knowing-- I
had known obviously

00:16:14.672 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
about the chakras
and those things,

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
but to him it was
his body, right?

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.749 align:middle line:84%
But there was an
experience of it.

00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first
time, and I was like,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.480 align:middle line:90%
oh, man, I'm onto something.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've got this
great kind of flow.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Every Saturday, I dedicate my
time for free, for years now,

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:90%
and I help people.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I sit in a room in this
retreat center and people come,

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and I just pull out my
toolbox and what do you got?

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:90%
So I've got a flow, right?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
You name it, problems,
and I'd help people.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm doing traumas and
different things of whatever,

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's working.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're all having
this experience,

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
either it will light up,
and they'll have pain, heat,

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:90%
and then a release.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Or some people won't even
notice the pain or heat,

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
they'll just experience
this release feeling.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:90%
Everybody uses the same words.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like I have
a weight lifted.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
It's like this
feels open and ease.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
There's an easiness to their gut
or to their chest or wherever.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.010 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, pretty cool.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.290 align:middle line:90%
That was kind of neat.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, things-- this really
started really spooling up

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
into the area of I can't even
believe this actually happened.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:37.122 align:middle line:84%
But the first one, I had the
board of directors come out

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and see me and somebody
wanted me to do a talk.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.996 align:middle line:84%
And three of the board
of directors-- and this

00:17:40.996 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:90%
is a bunch of doctors, right?

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.841 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge
conference of doctors.

00:17:43.841 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:90%
They want me to talk.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so three of the
board directors come out,

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and OK, we're going
to talk about,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
present on what we filmed in
our first interview last time.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yours and
my first interview.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Exactly.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Because they had seen it.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: They saw it on Gaia.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: The
doctors had seen it.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Exactly.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
The doctors saw it on Gaia, and
they said, this is valuable.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:90%
So I say, hey, no problem.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Do that.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Hey, by the way, you guys,
I got this other thing.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
know about this,

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:90%
and so I did it with them.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Two of the doctors said, yeah,
I got this thing, whatever

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:90%
emotional thing.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, same thing happened.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And they felt it, right?

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
They felt it, and
boom, it's gone.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The last one-- this
is where it gets

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:84%
weird- the last one's there, and
he's like, yeah, I ain't got--

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't have
any emotional thing.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But he says, my tooth, you
know my tooth, my tooth,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
it like hurts really bad,
and my face is kind of

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:90%
swelled up because of it.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
He had lost his enamel and the
dentist was in there doing--

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ow.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Ow.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, ow, exactly.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And the dentist did
something and it was going on

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:90%
for weeks and weeks.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
He asked me the first
time, and I said, no.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
This is not going
to work for you.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is for emotions.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
this is for emotions.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm sorry.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Asks me again.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't think so.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Third time, I said, well,
it don't cost nothing.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's-- I'll do it.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think it would work.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.375 align:middle line:84%
It went from a seven down
to one half of one point.

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:90%
A seven.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:90%
I was like, really?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, I'm not joking,
that actually happened.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like OK.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, on my Saturday
deals, a woman comes in.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:90%
She's got a cane.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
She's 85.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:90%
She looks like heck.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:90%
She's in a lot of pain.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Hey, let's do this.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.081 align:middle line:90%
I said--

00:19:49.081 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You did the
ball thing with her?

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:90%
She was OK?

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.531 align:middle line:90%
She was able to catch it?

00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: She was able
to catch it, right?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But her leg was in
like an eight of pain,

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:90%
and she obviously had issues.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
She walked out carrying her
cane, and this was physical.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.799 align:middle line:84%
So that was really
kind of amazing for me.

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow, there's
something going on here.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you're feeling
encouraged, confident.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Now I'm feeling--

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.350 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I'm feeling kind of
encouraged and confident.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And then along with
the weird coincidences,

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.276 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a business meeting,
this venture capital deal,

00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and a woman sits
down next to me.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, so what do you do?

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm-- my normal business,
cybersecurity, blah, blah,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:90%
blah.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm a neurocellular brain
scientist at Stanford.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.950 align:middle line:84%
I was like, mm,
that's interesting.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So I said, hey,
is there something

00:20:54.730 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:84%
going on in the brain if I,
for example, catch a ball,

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about the
brain sending the message

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:84%
to catch the ball, but when
you catch the ball right over

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
here or here, whatever, is
there something that gets

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:90%
activated in the brain?

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:90%
She says, yes, there is.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And she says, it's
called a place cell.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:84%
These place cells are part
of a complex system, right,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and it gives us our spatial kind
of orientation and different

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just one little
cell firing, it's a complex.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, oh, wow.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So we've got both ends
of the brain getting

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:84%
fired left and right,
and then these place

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:84%
calls, because I'm
throwing the ball randomly,

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:84%
right, and all over, these
things are getting fired.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, while the person is
focused on that one thing,

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and I know when somebody
focuses on one thing

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.737 align:middle line:84%
that it lights up that
part of the brain.

00:21:57.737 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So now, you've got both
halves of the brain,

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
place cells are getting
lit up, and most

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
of all, the intensity
of that one thing

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:90%
lit up literally in the brain.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:90%
So there's something going on.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:90%
And then I don't know why--

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.677 align:middle line:84%
well, there's a
connection, right?

00:22:16.677 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts and feelings, and
feelings and thoughts--

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:84%
great work of Joe Dispenza,
thoughts and feelings

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.995 align:middle line:90%
and the storage of these things.

00:22:23.995 --> 00:22:25.661 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's popular
with our viewers.

00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: He's
popular with me, too.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:90%
I love his work.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Next thing that happens is I'm
walking through the grocery

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.510 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm with my cart
through the grocery store,

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and you pass the
magazine aisle, right?

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:90%
And they've got all the lady--

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
"Shape" magazine,
"Cosmo," all the--

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:90%
"Pow" all those things.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.810 align:middle line:84%
On all the magazines,
they have lose weight

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
now on this great diet,
get these slim pants.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
January, December and January

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.069 align:middle line:90%
in particular, yeah.

00:23:03.069 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
this was summertime.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Get your summertime body.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.966 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's true.

00:23:06.966 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, get your bikini body back.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: All these
magazines, all the same thing

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.300 align:middle line:90%
on the front cover.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, this is kind
of interesting, because there's

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:90%
such a focus on weight.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about
it, you know how

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
my mind wanders about things
and starts chewing on it.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I was like, this
is a real problem.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And all these people, right,
are so focused on weight,

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:90%
and they're fighting.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:90%
They're all fighting the diet.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Whoever went on a diet
and was, like, oh, great,

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I get to eat some
lettuce today, or I'm

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:84%
going to eat melon today, or
something, whatever it is?

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is doing
two things, is

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
they're fighting their craving,
what they really want, right?

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they're also,
they're stuffing themselves.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:84%
In my thoughts,
underlying everything

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
was this feeling of
being unfulfilled.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And eating something,
you're sitting

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.330 align:middle line:84%
there feeling
unfulfilled, and you're

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.447 align:middle line:90%
trying to fill up, right?

00:24:19.447 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:90%
You're eating stuff.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, those thoughts
kind of ran through my brain.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:90%
I knew this was a major problem.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
the way in is the way out.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Friend of mine, I love to tell,
use his term, is in race cars,

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to say, the throttle, it's
your way into problems.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.436 align:middle line:90%
It's also your way out.

00:24:43.436 --> 00:24:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.285 align:middle line:84%
So that weekend,
I go back, I say,

00:24:48.285 --> 00:24:53.850 align:middle line:84%
hey, anybody who has a
craving, right, anything,

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and you want that
craving to go away,

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
like for candy or fried
foods or whatever.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what it is.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, one-by-one,
they obviously come

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:90%
in, and they're like--

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
the first one I did,
I think it was candy.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want
you to enjoy candy.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think
about all the enjoyment.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you are eating
your absolute favorite.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:90%
I want you to taste it.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:90%
I want you to smell it.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:90%
I want you to be in it, right?

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.640 align:middle line:90%
No holding back.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:90%
Just think it's good.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Eat it.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.462 align:middle line:90%
So OK, throw the ball.

00:25:35.462 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I put the intensity--
it was a 10

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.350 align:middle line:84%
for her, on a
scale of one to 10.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, 15 minutes, and again,

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.990 align:middle line:84%
a minor kind of heating
up in her lower abdomen.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And after 15
minutes, the feeling

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:90%
went to zero of the craving.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
that's interesting.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if it will work?

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Because who knows if it's going
to last until she walks out

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
the door, or if it's going to
last for the rest of her life.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:10%
But I ended up doing a
bunch of them over time.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:10%
One was Coca-Cola, ice cold
Coke, mm, good, you know?

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So I did all these different
ones-- chips, you name it,

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:90%
whatever their thing was.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.584 align:middle line:84%
And I had them do
the same process,

00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
and the same thing happened.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of them didn't
feel it in their body,

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:84%
but still, the
thing went to zero.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Followed up over the
course of weeks and months,

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle line:84%
because I was so curious
the next few days.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:41.295 align:middle line:84%
I followed up, and
what they all said is,

00:26:41.295 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I went back and ate it,
but it just lost its luster.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.250 align:middle line:84%
It was like it didn't
taste that good.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were satisfied.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It didn't
taste that good.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.308 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because they
were already filled up, right?

00:26:53.308 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I don't--
yeah, I don't know.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.631 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, when they're
doing that, you must have been

00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
reinforcing this
feeling of satisfaction,

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.400 align:middle line:84%
this completeness
or fullness, right?

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:84%
If they're imagining, oh, my
god, the feel on the tongue

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and the sweet and the salty
and the textures and everything

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:84%
while they're throwing
the ball, wouldn't that

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.950 align:middle line:84%
have reinforced the feeling
of full satisfaction?

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You know, I
don't know the truth.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.359 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just-- that's kind
of what I'm seeing in my head

00:27:26.359 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
is they fulfilled themselves
with the experience,

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and that you reinforced
this with the ball.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.597 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Somehow, there
was something stuck.

00:27:37.597 --> 00:27:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something
that locked it in.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: There was
something stuck somewhere,

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.480 align:middle line:84%
because the chakra got-- the
heat of that particular chakra,

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and then some of them were
just straight up release.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.040 align:middle line:90%
They felt this release.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
that gets released.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I don't-- there's things
I know and things I don't.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I can kind of, like,
speak to the results.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Following up though,
some people--

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:84%
all of them were very
high because this

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:90%
is their thing, right?

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.399 align:middle line:84%
On a scale of one to 10,
it's eight, nine, 10.

00:28:09.399 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially
with women and sweets.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the weeks after,
it would kind of creep up,

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
but it would only get to
maybe a three or four,

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:25.676 align:middle line:84%
something like that,
where it was manageable.

00:28:25.676 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they would do it
again, and it would go to zero.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But all of them had a vast
diminishment in what it was.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.900 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly enough, it
was contrary to everything

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:84%
we've been taught, which
is fight that darn thing

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.335 align:middle line:90%
through your will, right?

00:28:43.335 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it makes
sense, because there's

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:84%
a certain kind of
love and grace in it,

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.950 align:middle line:84%
where you're, like
you say, you're

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:52.080 align:middle line:84%
not going into conflict
with your own psyche

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:90%
and your own body.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
You're giving it the benefit
of the pleasure, right?

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You
know, some of these

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:84%
are, you know, going
to be just relief,

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.090 align:middle line:90%
but it's a non-drug relief.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it might
require a little effort,

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:84%
like 15 minutes a week
of pain management

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:84%
via tossing the ball
back and forth, right?

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a small price to pay.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Some of those drugs are tough.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, maybe.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's
not a recommendation.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm just thinking imaginatively,
it would be fun to play with.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I have no idea
what else you can apply it to.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I've just kind of applied
it where I've sought,

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:90%
just what's come to me.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just playing around,
and those are my results,

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.590 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:41.697 align:middle line:84%
Couple questions-- first of
all, I can think of one more,

00:29:41.697 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:84%
because you and I
talked on the phone.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:84%
You said, it was so weird, my
little six-year-old daughter--

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:84%
so that's another-- that's
a really interesting one.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.830 align:middle line:90%
So share that story.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So my daughter,
she's six, and she's just great.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:30:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So one day, this is not long
ago, we were just talking,

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:90%
and she says--

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:11.180 align:middle line:84%
we were kind of doing
exercises, and she says,

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.800 align:middle line:90%
I can't do push-ups.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.400 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure you can.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Go do a push-up.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, she tries to
get up and boom, falls down.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Come on, try again.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.560 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.730 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:22.855 align:middle line:90%
Tries, boom, down.

00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:23.655 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, well,
let's try something.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.777 align:middle line:90%
And she's seen me do this.

00:30:29.777 --> 00:30:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Playing with the ball.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.026 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, playing
with the ball before.

00:30:33.026 --> 00:30:33.897 align:middle line:90%
Let's play catch.

00:30:33.897 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:90%
We're just playing catch, right?

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:90%
She's six years old.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:90%
We're just going to play catch.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you have
her verbalize the color?

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.550 align:middle line:90%
I say, say the color.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I did.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Throw, catch, left, right.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, left, right, play catch.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Did it for about one
minute, just playing catch.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Just say the color.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK,
give me the ball.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.690 align:middle line:90%
All right, now do a push-up.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Ba-boom, like strong,
just like a pro.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I was like, hm, wow.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this would be
very interesting to people

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:10.500 align:middle line:84%
who are getting back in
some kind of fitness program

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, to start
thinking about how to make

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:84%
their brain cooperate with the
process of building strength,

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the implication.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.180 align:middle line:90%
That could be the case, right?

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, you're
unlocking something

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It unlocks something,
and gosh, I

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:84%
would love to get my hands
on Olympic, pro athletes

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.940 align:middle line:84%
or whatever and give
it a go with them.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Not that I
even watch that stuff.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.283 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, you must know
people who work out, and maybe

00:31:38.283 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:84%
just do like sets,
befores and afters,

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920 align:middle line:90%
what they're capable of.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.719 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:31:42.719 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's another--

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
something like that.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.450 align:middle line:90%
And so let me see this ball.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I love the size
of it, but I think

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:50.740 align:middle line:84%
you said this is your
prototype, right?

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.698 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
ultimately, this ball

00:31:52.698 --> 00:31:54.380 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a
little bit larger?

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.182 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, well, producing
beach balls and soccer balls

00:31:58.182 --> 00:31:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.564 align:middle line:84%
I think, I'll make different
sizes, travel sizes

00:32:02.564 --> 00:32:03.480 align:middle line:90%
or that sort of thing.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they
going to be made out

00:32:05.105 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:84%
of a plastic or a fabric
like this or what?

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The ones I have being
made right now are plastic.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's like this.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.380 align:middle line:84%
They have the panels, which
has a symbol and then it has--

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:90%
that correlates to the chakra.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about the first,

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.410 align:middle line:84%
second, third, fourth and
so forth, as the chakras go.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:90%
And so I have another question.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So when people are tossing
the ball back and forth,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.950 align:middle line:84%
do you ever find
that with some people

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.640 align:middle line:90%
the same color keeps coming up?

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.215 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Wow.

00:32:37.215 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Here's the weird thing,
right, is not only

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:46.730 align:middle line:84%
do I find that that happens
and it will happen repeatedly.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.050 align:middle line:90%
But here's the weird thing.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:84%
They'll be going along,
doing this, especially

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.267 align:middle line:84%
with people with a trauma,
they'll hit a color,

00:32:54.267 --> 00:32:55.350 align:middle line:90%
and it will make them cry.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:90%


00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:90%
But I won't let them up.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Keep crying, because
that stimulates

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.630 align:middle line:84%
that part of the brain
that the thing is stuck in.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I want them to stay in it.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:84%
It's actually better if they
can stay in that feeling of that

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:84%
so it lights up that
part of the brain.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so that's one thing.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I also find-- here's
the interesting thing,

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a correlation
in between where this ball like

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.200 align:middle line:90%
lands and the problem.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So what I'll find is that
they're fine left-right,

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.807 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll
throw it maybe low,

00:33:37.807 --> 00:33:39.390 align:middle line:84%
it didn't matter
where it is, but they

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:90%
will fumble in that place.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:46.470 align:middle line:84%
There's some stuckness
in between the physical

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and the mental and the whole
system, but it's in that place.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, I'll
start attacking that place.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.470 align:middle line:84%
If they fumble it
there, boom, boom, boom,

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I'll throw it there
repeatedly, and then

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll notice, all of a sudden,
they can catch it there then.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.137 align:middle line:84%
So there's multiple
things going on.

00:34:05.137 --> 00:34:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it would be
interesting to start noting,

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:10.679 align:middle line:84%
for example, if it's
say an emotional issue,

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:84%
and they're kind of coming up
with a preponderance of one

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:18.730 align:middle line:84%
particular color, to take
note of the emotion it is,

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and then look at it in terms
of classical color therapy.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Years ago, I was--

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:90%
this is past life stuff--

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I was obsessed
with color therapy.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:31.020 align:middle line:84%
This is probably, I'm
guessing, about probably close

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.010 align:middle line:90%
to 30 years ago now.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I read every
book there was.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.139 align:middle line:84%
I started giving
little seminars.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I even would speak to
the downtown Rotary Club

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:84%
with 600 men talking to them
about color and the impressions

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.909 align:middle line:84%
they're making in their work
life and for the widowers,

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:49.860 align:middle line:84%
if you wear a pink
shirt, you're going

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to have more luck with the
ladies and that kind of thing.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I noticed
that was really interesting,

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.080 align:middle line:84%
because we have this
visual component

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:90%
with the color that we--

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.090 align:middle line:84%
we're magnetized through
the visual perception is

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I would have people
in my classes

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and some of my workshops put
a bandana over their eyes

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.190 align:middle line:84%
so they couldn't see, and
then I used color lights

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:18.270 align:middle line:84%
with theater gels,
right, very pure colors.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And I would flash that
color on the group.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:25.460 align:middle line:84%
I would change colors
randomly on the group.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I would have them, as
soon as I switched color,

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.840 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, tell me what you feel.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And quickly, tell
me what you feel.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you feel.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And usually, 80% to
90% of the people

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.190 align:middle line:84%
would be on the same page,
which is I feel agitated.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:90%
I feel warm.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.847 align:middle line:84%
I feel this, which was
the color red, of course.

00:35:43.847 --> 00:35:44.930 align:middle line:90%
And then you'd go through.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have
to even see it,

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and they were
already experiencing

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.379 align:middle line:90%
the vibrational effects of it.

00:35:51.379 --> 00:35:52.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I was asking you.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:56.270 align:middle line:84%
If you're having one
color subconsciously

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.450 align:middle line:84%
being tossed repeatedly,
or you're subconsciously

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.150 align:middle line:84%
engaged with them,
tossing the same color

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and they're perceiving
it again and again,

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.910 align:middle line:84%
how deep that actually
goes on a vibrational level

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:12.440 align:middle line:84%
to associate this problem,
this action, with that color?

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.827 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: So interesting.

00:36:14.827 --> 00:36:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I do find that's the case.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'll spin that thing.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.795 align:middle line:84%
I'll spin it and throw
it, and it still comes up.

00:36:19.795 --> 00:36:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:22.919 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got some
kind of subconscious.

00:36:22.919 --> 00:36:26.390 align:middle line:84%
You guys are working
together on another level.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's fascinating.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I even did it--

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.200 align:middle line:84%
obviously, I do everything
to myself, right.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And I bounce it
off a wall, right?

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I bounce it.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I basically bounce
it off a wall, boom.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Do it to myself back and forth.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
and I find the same thing

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:44.459 align:middle line:84%
even happens with me,
and I'm conscious of it.

00:36:44.459 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm spinning the
heck out of it, right?

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.469 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
interesting-- again,

00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:50.510 align:middle line:90%
the pieces of the puzzle.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:51.759 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are coming together.

00:36:51.759 --> 00:36:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Have you tried this
yet, for example,

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.370 align:middle line:90%
in a corporate environment?

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: No.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:57.850 align:middle line:90%
I have not.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.391 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wouldn't
that be something?

00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Where you have kind of some
anxieties, misunderstanding,

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:84%
corporate stuff going
on, because of--

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and the whole team building
thing, unconscious thing.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:90%
It's noninvasive.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.742 align:middle line:90%
It's not woo-woo.

00:37:10.742 --> 00:37:12.950 align:middle line:84%
That would be really
interesting on a corporate level

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.372 align:middle line:90%
to get a few people in the room.

00:37:14.372 --> 00:37:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You know
what, it would.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:84%
You know what I
think it would do?

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.550 align:middle line:10%
Is help people to
start getting along

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:27.140 align:middle line:10%
and to start seeing
other points of view,

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:10%
because they're utilizing
more of their brain.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.050 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the push-up,
but it's emotional, right?

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.670 align:middle line:84%
My daughter could
now do a push-up

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.530 align:middle line:90%
and see things differently.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:37.602 align:middle line:90%
You could be broader.

00:37:37.602 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
why wouldn't it be?

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.476 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in the room with
someone you have an opposing

00:37:41.476 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:84%
viewpoint with and say, you're
just totally in resistance

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.191 align:middle line:90%
to this person.

00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Look what would
happen there, right?

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:84%
The resistance should
theoretically go from an eight

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.360 align:middle line:84%
or a 10 down to a
one or a zero, right?

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.875 align:middle line:84%
And then what-- then can
you hear each other, right?

00:37:55.875 --> 00:37:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Thank you.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's exactly it.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:02.090 align:middle line:84%
When you're in resistance,
you cannot even hear the other

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:90%
person, right?

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the other
interesting epiphanies

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.480 align:middle line:84%
that I had is that
in corporate life,

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:17.910 align:middle line:84%
is that our inability to
not hear the other person

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:23.970 align:middle line:84%
comes across as disrespect,
but underlying this is I

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:90%
don't see the good in you.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I can start
seeing the good in you,

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.060 align:middle line:90%
I'll start to listen.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's not you, your
idea, what you represent.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.400 align:middle line:90%
So can you work--

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.950 align:middle line:84%
say couples, for example,
or family members,

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:46.350 align:middle line:84%
can they work with this
together, where each of you

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:50.190 align:middle line:84%
has an issue with the other,
and you're cross tossing

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.530 align:middle line:90%
to each other at the same time?

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I so love that idea.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Haven't done it.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.280 align:middle line:90%
I love that idea.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wouldn't that be
something if you could engage

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.408 align:middle line:84%
with each other where you're
both focused on the thing that

00:39:01.408 --> 00:39:04.097 align:middle line:90%
you're upset about and you're--

00:39:04.097 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: And working together.

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Together.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Together
instead of just--

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.120 align:middle line:84%
because everybody I work
with is just one person.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.090 align:middle line:84%
They've got the bad feeling,
and I'm just helping them.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
the facilitator.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, I'm
helping them over it.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.741 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wouldn't it
be fun to find people

00:39:18.741 --> 00:39:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that have some kind of
beef going with each other

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and let them play with
it and see what happens?

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:23.918 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: They'd be willing.

00:39:23.918 --> 00:39:26.546 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Be willing to
show up with each other.

00:39:26.546 --> 00:39:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
that would work.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.102 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think you have
many more wonderful experiments

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:32.410 align:middle line:90%
ahead.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You gave me a
bunch of new experiments.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.617 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want to hear
from you after you do them.

00:39:38.617 --> 00:39:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yeah.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And when your--

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:84%
when are these balls
going to be in production

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.895 align:middle line:90%
and available to people?

00:39:44.895 --> 00:39:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: By the time
this airs, the website

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.837 align:middle line:84%
will be up and
going and available.

00:39:49.837 --> 00:39:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try and set it
up so that they can get them

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.540 align:middle line:90%
on Amazon or whatever.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.960 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, the
website of how the heck do I

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.580 align:middle line:90%
do this?

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And the main issue,
right, is going

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:11.580 align:middle line:84%
to be focus, because what
I find is people lose focus

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.780 align:middle line:90%
on the issue.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I literally have to remind
them every 30 seconds,

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:84%
go back to the problem,
because they want to avoid it.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
subconscious or whatever,

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:25.140 align:middle line:84%
but their mind will
drift, and they'll

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:29.310 align:middle line:84%
start focusing on the ball or
something and not on the issue.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And the power is to focus
on-- keep that brain lit

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:34.800 align:middle line:90%
up and focused on the issue.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the videos
do to keep you online

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and some other tips.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you have pain, just
like if you have pleasure

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:84%
with this food, you
want to roll in it.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you have pain,
same thing applies?

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.420 align:middle line:90%
You have to think of the pain?

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Get into it.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:53.576 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get into the pain.

00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Not avoid it.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- it hurts, and I
can't stand it, and ow, ow, ow,

00:40:58.350 --> 00:40:59.150 align:middle line:90%
ow.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think before we-- we
have a couple other discoveries

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.010 align:middle line:84%
you made, but before we get
off the topic of the ball,

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.510 align:middle line:84%
why don't you give
us a little demo.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.430 align:middle line:90%
You can use me as your person.

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: OK.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just keep
your head static, right?

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And then just like that, and
you look down with your eyes.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
down with your eyes,

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that helps you to connect
you with the emotion.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So your eyes down
actually allow you

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.860 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the
emotion of the problem.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And I just say to
people connect with it

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and then put it on a
scale of one to 10.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And be in it.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.140 align:middle line:90%
It's happening now.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:38.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.620 align:middle line:90%
And then I just throw the ball.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, and notice we're
going to go cross.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going cross-body
with both hands.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's causing her
to go cross-body.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.500 align:middle line:84%
But I need her to identify
the color and say the color.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:42:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Orange, orange,
blue, green, blue,

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Focus on the issue.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.459 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yellow, blue.

00:42:05.459 --> 00:42:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Stay in the problem.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:11.406 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Blue, green, orange.

00:42:11.406 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You go
different positions, right?

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
to tell you, it's

00:42:14.696 --> 00:42:17.370 align:middle line:84%
really hard to focus on the
problem when you're thinking,

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:90%
I have to catch it.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, your responding
I have to catch it,

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and I have to
identify the color.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.241 align:middle line:84%
There are two colors I'm
seeing at the same time.

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:26.034 align:middle line:84%
Do I say green,
or do I say blue?

00:42:26.034 --> 00:42:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh, yeah,
what was the problem again?

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:90%
What am I thinking of?

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.300 align:middle line:90%
So I can see the facilitator.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.100 align:middle line:90%
You have to--

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The facilitator has
to-- you need a facilitator

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:39.550 align:middle line:90%
to keep you on course.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe that's why,
say, two people working it out

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.270 align:middle line:84%
would be a little
difficult if you're both

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.580 align:middle line:84%
having a beef with each
other, because there's no one

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.266 align:middle line:90%
to tell the other one focus.

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Focus on that thing.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, or
you'll get better.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Here's the weird thing,
is as time goes on,

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.600 align:middle line:84%
the first five
minutes, seven minutes,

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:90%
it's, like, hard to focus.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And it gets easier to focus as
time goes on, and you speed up.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a desire to
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.270 align:middle line:90%
faster and faster as you go.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I just notice this
as a phenomenon.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But you experienced--
the beginnings of it

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.660 align:middle line:84%
are kind of hard to
concentrate, and that's

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:26.980 align:middle line:84%
why I kind of put together the
videos to, OK, focus on it.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Be in it now.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:90%
That type of thing.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.930 align:middle line:84%
No, I see that, and
I noticed in my case,

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:35.260 align:middle line:84%
the patterns were popping up
predominantly blue and orange.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.240 align:middle line:84%
There was a little
bit of green in there,

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and I think once yellow but
mostly blue and orange, blue

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:41.735 align:middle line:84%
and orange, which are the
complement of each other.

00:43:41.735 --> 00:43:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So they take you into that
frequency pretty deeply,

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and that has a whole
other component to it,

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:48.790 align:middle line:90%
which is really interesting.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Neat.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for sharing
the new ball discovery,

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.520 align:middle line:84%
but you have other, a couple
other discoveries you've made.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I do.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll start this
one with I actually

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:84%
kind of got tipped off on
this one by Rupert Sheldrake?

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.290 align:middle line:10%
You know Rupert Sheldrake,
the morphic field?

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:07.930 align:middle line:10%
What a wonderful guy.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: He's wonderful.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.260 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: So he referenced
this other guy, Dias, Dias,

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.090 align:middle line:10%
from Emory University.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And one of the experiments--

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I looked it up--
and the experiment

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:22.420 align:middle line:84%
was that they had
mice, and these mice

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:84%
were in a-- they had them in a
box with an electrical bottom.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And the experimenter, Dias, Dr.
Dias, and is a neuroscientist,

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:37.720 align:middle line:84%
he had this kind of
floral fruit scent.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And he took the floral,
chemical fruit scent,

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and he put it in the box,
just had the mice smell it.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.450 align:middle line:90%
And then he shocked them.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And then he continued,
every time he

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.120 align:middle line:84%
would hit them with the
scent, bam, they get shocked.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So these are
traumatized mice, right?

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So after he did it, and then
he would do the chemical.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:90%
And the mice would be like, ah!

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, freaked out,
right, as they should be.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So the neat thing was, is that
the descendants of the mice--

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.506 align:middle line:84%
not the mice in the box,
but the descendants--

00:45:22.506 --> 00:45:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Subsequent
generations, yeah.

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And descendants'
descendants ended up--

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.422 align:middle line:84%
you would take the
smell, and he'd

00:45:31.422 --> 00:45:33.130 align:middle line:84%
put it in the box with
these descendants.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.610 align:middle line:10%
These descendants
are not-- these

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:38.170 align:middle line:10%
are separated from
the original group.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.770 align:middle line:90%
And the mice are freaking out.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:45.310 align:middle line:90%
So we hold--

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Generational
patterns of trauma.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Exactly, exactly.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.780 align:middle line:84%
We think it's just
us, and it's not.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:56.566 align:middle line:84%
We're actually now
scientifically proving

00:45:56.566 --> 00:46:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to it, and
we have our ancestors' junk.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So the epiphany, right,
was I had obviously

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:14.590 align:middle line:84%
had some wonderful teachers,
just that are incredible.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the recurring themes
from these different masters

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:22.580 align:middle line:84%
was they would talk
about your eighth chakra,

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.680 align:middle line:90%
it's very powerful.

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.990 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It's powerful, and
that sort of thing.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I was like,
well, what's in it for me?

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.535 align:middle line:10%
I know it's powerful,
but so what?

00:46:37.535 --> 00:46:41.600 align:middle line:10%
If I can't use it what good
does that do me, right?

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:48.260 align:middle line:10%
So I had the idea one day, if
it's that powerful, it probably

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:52.220 align:middle line:10%
could erase out my
negativity or other's

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.520 align:middle line:10%
negativity out of my space.

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And William Buhlman, have
you ever heard of him?

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I don't know him.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.000 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: Buhlman he wrote
a lot of stuff related

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.200 align:middle line:10%
to out-of-body experiences.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.750 align:middle line:10%
And I think he's--

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:11.810 align:middle line:10%
the books are called
"Adventures Out of the Body."

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:14.510 align:middle line:10%
Wonderful, wonderful work.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from him was
that he's extremely commanding.

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:23.480 align:middle line:84%
When he goes out of
body, he commands.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.400 align:middle line:90%
This is what's going down.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm going here.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:27.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm going there.

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.390 align:middle line:90%
And he's really doing it.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So he's been at this for,
I don't now, 30, 40 years.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like, well,
you need to be commanding.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And I commanded
the eighth chakra

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to erase all of my negativity
and everyone else's

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.700 align:middle line:90%
out of my physical body.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So I did the command, and I
really felt it, and it worked.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:57.980 align:middle line:10%
So all you do is you
hold your attention

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:01.820 align:middle line:10%
over your head about 12 inches,
that's your eighth chakra,

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:06.710 align:middle line:10%
and you command it to erase
all of your negativity

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.500 align:middle line:10%
and everyone else is
out of your space.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.900 align:middle line:84%
You can do it for,
well, let's just

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:84%
say other dimensional
beings that

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:19.370 align:middle line:84%
might be in your space that are
kind of interfering and feeding

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:21.680 align:middle line:90%
on your problems.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.260 align:middle line:90%
So you hold that, and it works.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
thing was it

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:33.320 align:middle line:84%
wasn't until maybe a year
later, I had studied obviously,

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.760 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't connect the dots.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:42.200 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic teachings-- as
above, so below and so about.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been using my eighth
chakra to clear my space,

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.430 align:middle line:90%
and then it hit me.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.810 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, hm there's
below my feet, Earth,

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:56.890 align:middle line:90%
the Earth chakras.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And after things happened to me,
I wrote about that in my book,

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.510 align:middle line:84%
the whole opening of the crown
and the kind of being up here,

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of the attachment
to the divine realms

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and those sorts of things
and not very interested

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:20.350 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth and
all those things,

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:23.600 align:middle line:90%
because this is so overwhelming.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So what ended up
happening is I was like,

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:33.010 align:middle line:84%
huh, well, if it's so below,
then that would make sense

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.620 align:middle line:90%
that it's actually attached.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Those chakras are all
about your physical body.

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So I was like I commanded
the chakras below the feet,

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.960 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
center of the Earth,

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.520 align:middle line:84%
which are in control of
different things to erase

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:57.070 align:middle line:84%
everything from what I thought
was my ancestors' or my past

00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:00.690 align:middle line:90%
lives out of my physical body.

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it worked, and
I've taken a lot of people

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.050 align:middle line:90%
through this.

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:07.390 align:middle line:10%
And they just hold
the command for those

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:12.310 align:middle line:10%
to erase all of those
traumatic experiences

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:16.780 align:middle line:10%
and fears of my ancestors
out of my space.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And when people do this,
it's an amazing thing.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I even took some people
here through the process

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.170 align:middle line:90%
before the show.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Is you end up experiencing it
not only throughout your body,

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.920 align:middle line:84%
but then you'll notice that
this feeling up your legs

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and up and through your body,
it starts to connect you.

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:40.460 align:middle line:90%


00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.420 align:middle line:84%
What's so important, I
think some of your guests

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:47.410 align:middle line:84%
talk about this is the body
is like a battery, right?

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, this being,
say, the positive,

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.750 align:middle line:84%
if you have this huge
positive, you also

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:56.070 align:middle line:84%
need to have equally
a negative charge

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:59.380 align:middle line:84%
as well, which is the Earth
and the Earth chakras.

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So you can really
boost your growth

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.050 align:middle line:84%
through clearing
your space, and it's

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:11.080 align:middle line:84%
helping you and all
of your ancestors

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.360 align:middle line:90%
at the same time in releasing.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And this is fast.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:18.850 align:middle line:84%
You hold the command
for, let's say, a minute,

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:20.590 align:middle line:90%
and you'll feel it.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the word
"command" is really interesting,

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's critical to
what you're talking about.

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And I remember years ago, I
was chatting with my beings

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that I'm associated with, my
uber guides, and they said,

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:40.390 align:middle line:84%
don't come to us or any
other guides as a beggar.

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:44.495 align:middle line:84%
They said you need to
command what you want.

00:51:44.495 --> 00:51:45.670 align:middle line:90%
There is power.

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:49.610 align:middle line:84%
There's electricity in
that energy of the command.

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you need help from beings
beyond, guides and so forth,

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.240 align:middle line:84%
they will do it if it's within
their own structure of ethics

00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.270 align:middle line:90%
and ability.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:02.110 align:middle line:84%
They'll help you,
but command it.

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Humans act like
beggars, because we

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:08.800 align:middle line:84%
have this horrible inferiority
complex as a species

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that we tend to come with
our little begging bowls.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Give us a little scrap.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Would you please
help me with this?

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm so defeated, and all this.

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:18.010 align:middle line:90%
And they said no.

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Come out and command
what you wish,

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and if it's in alignment with
everything, you will be helped.

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I just wanted to toss
that in, because we often,

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:35.140 align:middle line:84%
especially women in
particular, don't generally

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:36.870 align:middle line:90%
command anything.

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right right.

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's a
different feeling in the body.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:43.570 align:middle line:84%
It's very intense to
command something,

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.300 align:middle line:90%
and I think that's really--

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.297 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you brought
that up to begin with,

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:49.630 align:middle line:84%
because I think that's key
to the success of what you're

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:50.590 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:51.940 align:middle line:90%
That's my guess.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely,
because it's just

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.260 align:middle line:84%
sitting there doing
nothing, and now you're

00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:00.040 align:middle line:84%
just going to hold the
command of what is to happen.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:07.230 align:middle line:84%
You have one more, that is
the one about estrangement.

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: This one--
one of the things

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I just love about this program
is being able to get this out

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:15.190 align:middle line:84%
to people and really change
everybody's relationships

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:16.700 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.100 align:middle line:90%
So I have many, many stories.

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'll be able
to tell them with the time.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:26.304 align:middle line:84%
This sounds kind of really like,
how could that work or basic,

00:53:26.304 --> 00:53:27.220 align:middle line:90%
but I got to tell you.

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I have so many stories of
people I've taught this to that

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:32.680 align:middle line:90%
have had--

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:36.370 align:middle line:84%
they were friends forever,
and then something happened.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:39.155 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea what,
but the person is gone,

00:53:39.155 --> 00:53:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and they won't talk
to you anymore.

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, family members, I've had
them come to me, and I say,

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:49.840 align:middle line:84%
just do this one thing
and just keep doing it.

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.680 align:middle line:84%
48 hours later, all of a
sudden, the phone rings.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like, hey, what's up?

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.650 align:middle line:84%
The girls are like, hey, you see
"The Bachelorette" last night?

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.340 align:middle line:90%
What a blah, blah, blah.

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Nothing--

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.473 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like nothing happened.

00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Like
nothing happened.

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And even stranger
than that, relationships that

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:13.810 align:middle line:84%
went five years,
and they literally

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:18.730 align:middle line:84%
hadn't seen each other, and
maybe four or five days later,

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:24.970 align:middle line:84%
it's like forced situation,
and the person is like, hey.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:25.780 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.010 align:middle line:90%
We need to go to lunch?

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Can you go tomorrow to lunch?

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.300 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:30.680 align:middle line:10%
I'd love to see you.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.450 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, it's
extraordinarily simple.

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:39.340 align:middle line:84%
All you do is just
imagine a tube

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.980 align:middle line:84%
of white divine
light coming down

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.200 align:middle line:84%
through the top of your
head, down through your neck,

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to your heart, and then
out like a fire hose,

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.160 align:middle line:84%
flowing right at
that person's chest.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And you just let it go,
and ascend the attention

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.780 align:middle line:84%
that it's just to keep flowing
and starting to empower.

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With
that, I thank you.

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I love that you brought
your magical bag of tricks

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:05.290 align:middle line:90%
to us once again.

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:07.150 align:middle line:84%
You're always coming
up with new ones

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:11.150 align:middle line:90%
in your little magic factory.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.574 align:middle line:84%
So when you come up with
the next batch of ideas,

00:55:13.574 --> 00:55:14.990 align:middle line:84%
we'll come back
and do this again.

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: All
right Sounds great.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.620 align:middle line:84%
