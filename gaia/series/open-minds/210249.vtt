>>RODERICK MARTIN:
It just so happened,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I looked up and I saw this
little disk thing moving like--

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and it was followed
by 2 military jets.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But it was a secret
because in my community,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.440 align:middle line:84%
that's not something that
you go and talk about.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials weren't
inducting us, why not?

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.157 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, we done
been on ships in the past.

00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting on another
ship without a destination.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:84%
The younger people
are now being,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.480 align:middle line:84%
what I consider, emotionally
and religiously bankrupt.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.850 align:middle line:84%
You start thinking,
wait a minute,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:90%
free energy, no billions.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Free energy, no billions.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Lock the door.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Tell everyone, your
eyes are useless when

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.230 align:middle line:90%
your mind is blind.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
We got to get past the
point where we see things

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:84%
but our mind won't
let us interpret it.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
People ask all the
time, Roderick,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.295 align:middle line:90%
what do the ETs look like?

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, I don't
know if you want my answer.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.712 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad you just asked me.

00:01:01.712 --> 00:01:05.063 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
One community that we

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:84%
hear very little from regarding
the fascination with UFOs

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:90%
is African Americans.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Yet some of the better-known
tribes of Africa,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
such as the Dogons, believe
they're from the stars.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:84%
That ETs are their star
brothers and sisters.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So why the lack
of interest here?

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Roderick Martin
is here to fill us

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.040 align:middle line:84%
in on the background
of African Americans

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.635 align:middle line:84%
and your history
with UFOs in America.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, that's good.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk about it.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's good to
have you here, Roderick.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.905 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm glad
to be here with you.

00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's,
first of all,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:84%
start up with you because
it's not part of the culture.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But as a little
kid, you had interest.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about personally,
where your interest in UFOs

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
came from to set
the stage for this.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, Regina,
I think, for me,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
it started when I
was 12 years old.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, I lived in Dallas,
near the Dallas Zoo.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:10%
So outside of hearing all
those animals and gorillas

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:10%
and lions in the middle
of the night, one night

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:10%
I was coming in.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And my mom had this thing about
flashing the porch light when

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:90%
it's time to come in the house.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And so at that point,
you know, she's flashing.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:90%
So I'm taking the stroll of--

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.760 align:middle line:84%
well, at that point--
shame because I'm

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:90%
the only kid coming in early.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else,
nya, nya, nya.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:10%
So it was right when the
night stars began to come out.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:10%
So it's right at darkness.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And just so
happened, I looked up

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and I saw this little white
little disk thing moving like--

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and it was followed
by two military jets.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it came back
and, actually, it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:90%
was following them.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment, I did
not realize the significance

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:90%
of that moment.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But I did know I was looking at
something that wasn't normal.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.035 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, of course I've
watched TV, so I figure like,

00:02:46.035 --> 00:02:46.835 align:middle line:90%
hmm.

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And it just had my curiosity,
just my Scooby-Doo thing.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:90%
I went, ruh?

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But as the years
and months passed by

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and then I start
watching a TV shows,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
you talking Close Encounters
of the Third Kind, just all

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
of these shows, that's when
you knew this was what it was.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:90%
But it was a secret.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Because in my community,
that's not something

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:90%
that you go and talk about.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Even the neighborhood
bully wasn't

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.405 align:middle line:84%
going to be sitting
on the corner like,

00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:90%
you know I saw a UFO last night.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, then
street credit gone.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.622 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: He's not taking
my lunch money no more.

00:03:20.622 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So-- I wasn't the
neighborhood bully either.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
But the whole point
was it's just something

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that was unspoken,
and, of course,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
it carried with
me until an adult.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.322 align:middle line:84%
Until I start realizing there
is a place to talk about that.

00:03:32.322 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But did you talk to
your mom or anybody about it?

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Did you tell--

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:90%
So you just kept it to yourself.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.237 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, you
kept it to yourself.

00:03:39.237 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I became a
high school athlete.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:84%
You became well known
and so it's still,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:84%
how did I know at a
young age that this

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:90%
could hurt my reputation?

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.317 align:middle line:84%
Especially the street
credit, period,

00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:90%
that was a lot those days.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So growing up in
high school, so I'm like,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
no, I'm not going
to talk about it.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And I might have whispered
it every now and then

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:90%
if someone else said something.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:90%
But outside of that, no.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it turns
out, since then, I mean,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:84%
I think we've all
learned, Texas is

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
kind of a hotbed
for a lot of UFO

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:90%
and military activity, right.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I tell people I live
in the jumbo state, where--

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Where those
UFOs come out to play.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.339 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they do.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny--

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's
the Texas State.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's--

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico gets
all the attention.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is there's
a lot of activity

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:84%
that is both UFO and military,
combined, the presence of both,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:90%
a lot in the state of Texas.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever figured
out why that is?

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I think because
we have this big area of land

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
in Texas that just probably,
I can't say totally explored,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.262 align:middle line:84%
just now the people
don't live there.

00:04:42.262 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
so it's very open.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.598 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, so
it's a great place,

00:04:45.598 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:84%
even with higher
intelligence to know

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.182 align:middle line:84%
if they want to travel
somewhere and not be seen.

00:04:49.182 --> 00:04:50.722 align:middle line:90%
They'll probably do that.

00:04:50.722 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there's
probably a lot

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
of hidden military installations
that they are observing just

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:90%
probably in those places.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's got a lot of
undercurrent things happening

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.950 align:middle line:90%
in Texas.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it does.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of cases
come out of there.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So when did you become
aware that there

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
were people talking about
it, but they're all white.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There actually was
a whole field dedicated--

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: More than
that, a whole world.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.212 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -- a whole
world dedicated to it.

00:05:15.212 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:84%
But being African-American, you
weren't aware of that world.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I wasn't--
let's say, I saw it,

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I knew what I wasn't seeing.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have an
answer at that time to why.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't dawn until now
until I've done more research

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and understand culture
and lenses when

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:90%
it comes down to these things.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But back then, yeah, so all
you saw was white people.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you did think
that that was it.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.095 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials weren't
abducting us, why?

00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:45.112 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I had my
old running joke.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.275 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, we done
been on ships in the past,

00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
we're not getting
on another ship

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:90%
without a destination, period.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:90%
So you're not getting me on one.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:90%
So maybe they knew that.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was
just kind of weird.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:90%
It stuck there.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
You just left it to the side,
then it became a reality.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.633 align:middle line:90%
Then that's when I knew.

00:06:04.633 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it turns
out, maybe they were.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I think,
yes, and I will believe that.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's those
untold stories that's

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
talk about at this time

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.115 align:middle line:84%
the community, you
had credibility

00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:90%
that you were working with.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:84%
You have the entire white
world working against you

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make you
less credible, right--

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --as a group.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And so you're doing
everything you

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
can to just build credibility to
function in the United States.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Get educations, do your
jobs, and so forth.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
You don't need this
kind of embarrassment

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to come around in your
community and in your background

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and talk about it, right.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So if
you're referring back

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:90%
to someone reporting a UFO.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go back into
think even white people,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.688 align:middle line:84%
then, was being
ridiculed for that.

00:06:56.688 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they were.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, so both
sides would be ridiculed.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.210 align:middle line:84%
But then when it comes down to
an African-American community,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
where they're seen a
little less credible, then

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:84%
therefore it's just not going
to fan out with all of that.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So now when you think about
that as far as a Black person

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and saying, OK, I'm going
to not only go and report

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:90%
this UFO sighting.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And you already
seem less credible

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:90%
on any other situations.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.215 align:middle line:90%
And so just--

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why bother?

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Why bother?

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
that other factor.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So think about back
then, if we're going back

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
into the '50s and '60s, there
was a lot of insult to injury.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
other stuff to worry

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.670 align:middle line:84%
about that was bigger
in that trench wall

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.795 align:middle line:90%
to report something like that.

00:07:47.795 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So you could have been hung,
you could have been lynched.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
There's just a lot of other
variables, nevertheless--

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As an insane person.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: As an insane person.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So you'll probably have a
guaranteed don't pass go,

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:90%
don't get out of jail free card.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're going
to go, you know,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
be seen crazy, period.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.962 align:middle line:84%
And that would just
been an added bonus.

00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was like
what the whites at that time

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
were doing but on steroids, in
terms of its potential effect.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Yet interestingly, now just
let's set the stage a bit.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So in the 1950s
and early '60s, you

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of these visitations
in bell-shaped craft.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful people from Venus,
you have George Adamski,

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:84%
you have Howard
Menger, Frank Stranges

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
writing about "Stranger
at the Pentagon,"

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and the beautiful Val Thorens,
the people he came with.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:84%
These are just all white, all
beautiful, well suited out,

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:84%
and they came to
deliver messages.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Val Thor, you read it.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:84%
It said that he
lived in a chamber

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.270 align:middle line:84%
in a room at the Pentagon
for a couple of years.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he had
regular conversations

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:90%
with President Eisenhower.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Byrd's nephew worked
there, high clearance,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and said, this is true.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
He was there and
this did happen.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they came
with these messages

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:84%
like you need to stop
warring with each other,

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.188 align:middle line:84%
stop polluting the
place, and eat better

00:09:09.188 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
live a long time.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Simple messages.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Probably the
message I didn't get.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.817 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, maybe
you didn't get that one.

00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The eat better message
did not get filtered down.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the result of new
disclosure from Balfour.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:90%
No, go ahead.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.758 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:09:24.758 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm going to
push that narrative.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these were kind
of cautionary tales done

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:90%
in a polite way.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Now this is where a
Black man did come in.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:90%
You have Betty and Barney Hill.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's one of
the most famous abductions

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.532 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably because it
was the first one that was

00:09:44.532 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:90%
talked about as such, right?

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here you
have them abducted.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Now the story
changes, you're not

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:84%
talking about gentlemanly
and womanly, gentle womanly

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Venusians coming here to
deliver an important message.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Now you're talking
about hostile activity.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Seemingly
hostile activity.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
and how that did or didn't

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.837 align:middle line:90%
change anything for Blacks.

00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I don't think
it changed anything.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:84%
It didn't move
the needle at all.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Because any time you
still have, let's just

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
say, the interracial
couple thing.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That still doesn't
validate that whole situation

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.565 align:middle line:84%
just because it was
just a little bit--

00:10:20.565 --> 00:10:22.773 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's true, so
many people were prejudiced

00:10:22.773 --> 00:10:24.232 align:middle line:90%
just at the relationship.

00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: There you go.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going
to really take that

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
into consideration of being
something positive for sure.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
Betty's background,

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I think she had enough clout
in the community to at least

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to validate Barney
being with her

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:90%
in that particular abduction.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So until they were interviewed,
where people start saying,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, the evidence is
lining up that this actually

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:90%
could have happened.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
But still in the
African-American community,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
it's not something
that was plastered

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.720 align:middle line:84%
over Black newspapers in
those Black communities,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:84%
where we would have read
that or studied that.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Or Black scientists
or people would

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.303 align:middle line:84%
have been involved in that
same scientific study.

00:11:09.303 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
just kind of hushed.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:90%
You just-- did you--

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
did people didn't even
know about it really?

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.633 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, I mean, if
you think about it for me

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
personally, I read the
story later on in my career

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.990 align:middle line:90%
and it still just stuck out.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:84%
But it did hang out
there a little bit.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
But like, OK, this is
an African-American guy.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But then when I
started digging deeper,

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that's when I noticed there
was a whole lot of things that

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
could have been left out which
started my personal plight

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:90%
to uncover these things.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's go
into the community itself.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So you have the heavily
religious aspect

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:84%
of the African-American
community.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Now we can even line this up
with the heavily religious part

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:90%
of the Caucasian community.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.057 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:11:54.057 --> 00:11:56.450 align:middle line:84%
happens when there's religion,
deep religious beliefs,

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
involved, especially
for African Americans

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's quite
different than for whites.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, so you have
to start with how we got here

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of the story
of us being brought here,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.830 align:middle line:84%
stripped from the history of
whatever our beliefs were,

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.400 align:middle line:84%
now you have this belief
that we're being taught.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
At this point,
Christianity for me.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
hearing, here's the book.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Here's how this works.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now that's already
kind of disconnected anyway.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So you still have
this curiosity of what

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:90%
we're currently dealing with.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, now
you have this new element.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:90%
This new outer space element.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
This new potential the
world is big thing.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Or there's people from other
places and who are their gods,

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:90%
or what do they believe in.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Or are they transplanted here,
or are they brought here?

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Just all of these things
begin to stir the pot.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But when you start thinking
about community side now.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, OK, we
have a report of a UFO.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And I take it into my own
personal account, my own story,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll share with you.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.415 align:middle line:84%
But when you start
hearing about it

00:13:14.415 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
in African-American
community, that's taboo.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:90%
No, it can't be.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing else besides--

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our new God.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.855 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing else.

00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is absolute.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:90%
The word is the word.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
that's how it's taught.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.495 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's
how it's taught.

00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:90%
And even from being a young kid.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Now for me, I had already
had the different experience

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:84%
that there's something else
there, from my experience.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone has had
that experience, so they say.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, I was
already kind of curious.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And especially, my
mom was always, hey,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:90%
you're sticking to this word.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:90%
The word is absolute.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And then one day I came across
a scripture, Genesis chapter 1

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:90%
verse 26.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:84%
"Let's make man in our image,
and the likeness of ourselves."

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Now I've been to school.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:90%
I understand "our" is plural.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:90%
"Ourselves" mean more than one.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, unless we've
got a delusional God now.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.218 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
Genesis 1 and 2

00:14:09.218 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
are quite interesting
to rub together.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.438 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And so I'm going, so
I go to my mom and I'm like,

00:14:13.438 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:90%
hey, what is this?

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's the
Trinity, it's all of this stuff.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.230 align:middle line:90%
But it just doesn't make sense.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.780 align:middle line:90%
So you just shelve it.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But then when I got
in a full grown adult,

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.132 align:middle line:84%
I can talk for myself, I'm
not going to get in trouble.

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:84%
No punishment's behind me
voicing my thoughts now,

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And I pay my own bills.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And so for this point, I
go, mom, that is not that.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: And so--

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
threatening to her.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I mean, I
have-- this past Thanksgiving,

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:90%
I was at my mom's--

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
or last year-- and
I had a UFO book.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And literally, I had a sit-in
front of the microwave.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:90%
She walks into the kitchen.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.195 align:middle line:90%
She says, move that.

00:14:51.195 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Now we're probably closer than
you and are standing here.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm not touching it.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.418 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And I'm like, just
give it to me, I'll put it up.

00:14:57.418 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not thinking what
she's truly saying.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Move it.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
just hand it to me.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't touch it.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:84%
It was a big book
that said, "UFOs."

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably
about a year--

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:90%
the last one.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
said, wait a minute.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
It's time for you to go deeper
into the cultural lens of this.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And I had already just got
out of a marriage, a divorce.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
In my marriage,
although our issues

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:84%
had issues, one in particular
was, I could not talk about--

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --UFO
things in the house.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.977 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And then
when I told her

00:15:31.977 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to pursue it
as a career of interest,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:90%
she just was not in agreement.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But as of today,
man, I have studied,

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
I've done 400 interviews,
and seen this thing

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:90%
from a cultural lens.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't her fault,
not even close.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: She just could not
bear with that from the culture

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:90%
lens.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me
ask you about that.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Because as you're talking,
I'm thinking, wait a minute.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So people being taken from
their home, brought over here,

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
treated very, very
poorly, to say the least.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To this
day, still not being

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
able to just walk
down the street

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and be viewed equally with
another person beside them.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Which is just unfair and
heinous on every level.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you think you introduce
religion, and especially

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
the New Testament and
the fact that Jesus

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
is going to save you,
Jesus is here to save you.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of
faith and hope that

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
would have to go into that
belief for African Americans

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:84%
compared to whites is a whole
other order of magnitude,

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I would think.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, believing it
with all your heart

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.073 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to
be better one day.

00:16:42.073 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
better on the other side,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:84%
because this side's not
looking easy or too good

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:90%
a lot of times.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm just feeling that to
rock that on any level

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
could be very challenging
because the need

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.880 align:middle line:84%
for the belief that it's all
going to be OK in the end

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:90%
is so powerful.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, Regina, I think
you're making a valid point

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:90%
when it comes down to that.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:84%
But what is changing
in all of this,

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:12.220 align:middle line:84%
let's divide the community
in religious things

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.258 align:middle line:84%
into young people
and older people.

00:17:15.258 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, changing.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So now we have
the younger people who are

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
probably-- and I'm not
speaking for everybody,

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:90%
just what most that I know--

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:84%
are now being, what I consider,
emotionally and religiously

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:90%
bankrupt.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So it does leave the door
open for the possibility

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.132 align:middle line:90%
and curiosity of this--

00:17:36.132 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Other things.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.423 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --this new phenomenon.

00:17:38.423 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness and fourth
density, all these other--

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:84%
there's just something
else bigger here.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But the other section, people
are my age and above know

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:90%
is, this is not going to happen.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you're still
needing and wanting

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:90%
the faith and all that to work.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So now you embed this
new, there's possible aliens,

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.713 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's
possibility that they

00:18:05.713 --> 00:18:06.880 align:middle line:90%
the one who brought us here.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Oh, people ask all
the time, Roderick,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:90%
what do the ETs look like?

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, I don't
know if you want my answer.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad you just asked me.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.983 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, what
if we look like them?

00:18:18.983 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And it usually just
shocks them, period.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.480 align:middle line:90%
They're like-- you know.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm real
careful with that.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But my job is to
provide information

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
that people can read,
that they can see,

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that they could think about
to awaken their curiosity.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Just to the possibility
that we're not alone

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:90%
in this universe.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Because although I
believe we are not alone,

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.540 align:middle line:84%
but you just don't
press that up on anyone.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Especially if they're still
trying to figure out--

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --the religious life.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.363 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Am I doing this right?

00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Is this thing even
working for me?

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Am I going to
heaven when it's all done?

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And OK, so now you take
the next thing, once people

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
are considering
themself being "woke,"

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
now the thought of
reincarnation comes in.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:90%
And all of that, all that--

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How's that play
in the Black community?

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.128 align:middle line:90%
Reincarnation--

00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's another taboo.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Because
we are mostly told,

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and mostly everyone in
religion are told that,

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.025 align:middle line:84%
hey you're going to go and
get that mansion in heaven.

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is the
split in the community now

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:90%
between religious and sectarian?

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:90%
We know youth is a factor.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:90%
So what is that split?

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And is it starting to
seep in through the youth

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and through the
youth that are maybe

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:84%
looking at other ways of
viewing other religions

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of the world, Eastern
philosophies and so forth?

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, I
don't think it's--

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I think religion itself is being
pushed in a younger generation

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:90%
to a side, period.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, so it's--

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.408 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not being replaced
with other philosophies and--

00:19:51.408 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: People are
now trying to rely off

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:84%
of meditation, consciousness,
or spirit-being,

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
or being communicated by some
higher force within themselves.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:90%
And so I think--

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and that's something easier to
deal with because of the fact

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that it's something
they could feel.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it leaves you
open to question a lot of things

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
that you can't question
from the other perspective.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.572 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, and that leads
us into the paranormal, right.

00:20:18.572 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I wanted
to ask you about that.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, so that
leads us into ghosts,

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.860 align:middle line:90%
paranormal, versus ETs, aliens.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been doing
some research trying

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.310 align:middle line:84%
to figure out, OK, or could
they be one of the same.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
How do we know the
difference between a ghost

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:84%
can walk through the
walls, and now we knowing

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:90%
ETs can walk through walls?

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:90%
All these other density things.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I grew
up in a community,

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:84%
at one point of time, a ghost
is deemed bad because it's--

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A demon.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --nya, nya, nya.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.498 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
thinking about that,

00:20:52.498 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and then you go, where
does this come from?

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Why are we thinking this way?

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:84%
However, our ancestors
were taught meditating,

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
feel the spirits, and when
someone dies in our family,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:84%
oh, I can feel them,
they was here yesterday.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle line:90%
All of these things.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So that it gives us,
at least, not a lot

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:90%
of fear in the paranormal.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Except for where this
ghost thing comes.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's say
I got a ghost in my house.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't but let's say I do.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
I don't want one.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:90%
But they come over.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.600 align:middle line:84%
The ghostbusters
come to the house.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Roderick, you
got this ghost upstairs.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, get rid of
this ghost because this is--

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:90%
I can't handle it, it's bad.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
But what if they come back and
say that's your grandmother?

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
The spirit upstairs
is your grandmother.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is something that

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
was brought from Africa, was
the understanding of ancestors

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.218 align:middle line:84%
and that they
continue after death,

00:21:47.218 --> 00:21:48.510 align:middle line:90%
and they're there to guide you.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.182 align:middle line:84%
Which the Christian, white
communities don't have.

00:21:51.182 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: There you go.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And so now I had to make a
decision of, OK, wait a minute.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So the thing upstairs
that was bothering me,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
making these noises,
and I'm afraid of.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I brought you in
here and now you're

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:84%
saying it's my grandmother
who gave me milk and cookies.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.655 align:middle line:84%
And I'm supposed to say, oh,
just let her stay up there.

00:22:08.655 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no, granny
gots to go because I don't

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:90%
want no ghost in my house.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:90%
So now we take in the ET side.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:90%
So how do we believe in that?

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:10%
And I think it comes just down
to the simplicity of people

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:10%
have not seen an ET.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:10%
Not everyone has seen a UFO.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And those who have experienced
abductions or contact,

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:84%
or night sleep paralysis,
all those things,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:90%
are not talking about it.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it takes us
from that experience to why

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.020 align:middle line:84%
is the African-American
community, in most cases,

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.280 align:middle line:84%
are not educated on the
phenomena in that way.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.033 align:middle line:84%
Because you only get
educated through experience.

00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and the community

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:middle line:84%
does have, like you say,
the natural phenomena

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.137 align:middle line:84%
of understanding
granny's still around.

00:22:58.137 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Just because her body died,
doesn't mean she's not here.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
practices in the South

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:90%
that were brought from Africa.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Witchcraft and voodoo and things
that are practiced, and these

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:84%
are phenomena and
they actually work.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're phenomena
that are actually effective.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:90%
And so when you look at why--

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:16.848 align:middle line:90%
well, you can't.

00:23:16.848 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are
thousands of reasons

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.267 align:middle line:84%
why that was brought
over with everybody,

00:23:20.267 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:90%
it was just part of the culture.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
But to accept these
things fairly naturally.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And to have healthy
bunny ears up,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.520 align:middle line:84%
healthy suspicions
about what's going on

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:84%
around you, and instincts
about that, for sure survival.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to
have your bunny ears

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:90%
up probably more than I do.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: My bunny ears stay
up with an extra set of ears,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle line:84%
some antennas, radar scopes, you
name it, all of those things.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Because even me as an
investigator in my community,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:90%
I still have a challenge.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I still can
approach-- and I

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.150 align:middle line:90%
do investigate both sides.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'll get people that
are white and say, hey--

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:90%
or all races--

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:90%
can you look at this.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
But then you still have
to say, OK, it still

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:08.730 align:middle line:84%
has got a credibility thing
because I'm Black telling them

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:84%
about, yeah, what you saw is
this, or maybe it's not that.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Especially if I'm the one that
gives them the bad news of what

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:90%
they thought they saw was not--

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not that.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --that.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:22.367 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, it is like--

00:24:22.367 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you how many times.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.677 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And suddenly
race comes in.

00:24:25.677 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: You just get it.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like, well, who are you?

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to
do with the training

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and different things I
received working with MUFON

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of those
different organizations.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:40.333 align:middle line:84%
It's now back to who was telling
me this and how do you know.

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're now
challenging their experience.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.583 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You're
challenging more than that.

00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Because people tend
to want to believe.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Especially when it gets
down to these experiences.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:57.242 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned now to truly
establish this new way when

00:24:57.242 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking and
communicating with people

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:90%
with these experiences.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing
most people want is,

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Regina, is for you
to believe them.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: In most cases,
no one else would.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So I've now developed this thing
called, I believe, you believe.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually writing
a book about it.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's more or less saying,
OK, Regina you come to me

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and say, Roderick,
there is a leprechaun

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:90%
over there behind the dumpster.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm looking at the
dumpster and you're saying,

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:90%
do you see the rainbows?

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.760 align:middle line:90%
There's gold in a leprechaun.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I have two choices.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I can turn around and we
have a relationship or not.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:90%
I can say, well, I don't see it.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at me and
you want the honest truth,

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.710 align:middle line:90%
do you believe me?

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
whole different thing.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But my new technique,
which is still from the heart--

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --it says, Regina,
I believe you believe

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:90%
that there is something there.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.842 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason, I'm going
to go on a journey with you.

00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that's very
important to validate people.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you talk to
Tanis Halliwell,

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
she lives with leprechauns, and
she'll tell you all about them.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: There you go.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.728 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They mess with her.

00:26:00.728 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: So there you go.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You just have to say, hey,
I believe you believe it.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think if any of
the family members,

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
people who help people that
say they've being abducted,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
or they come across that,
is to begin to indicate them

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:90%
through it honestly.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't see this, but I
trust you as an individual.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Not what you say you saw
or the things, and plus

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
I can't validate your
experience anyway.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.583 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But because
the love and the trust

00:26:26.583 --> 00:26:30.463 align:middle line:84%
that I have for you, I believe
you believe it happened to you.

00:26:30.463 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore I'm going to
go on this journey with you.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to investigate this.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.537 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We're going
to investigate it.

00:26:35.537 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I brought that
up because the whole notion

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.850 align:middle line:84%
of the bunny ears is,
you have to be alert.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to have eyes in
the back of your head just

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:90%
to go through life safely.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:84%
That also pumps up a
person's intuition.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is part of
the intuitive faculty.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So I would think
that on one level,

00:26:56.050 --> 00:27:00.190 align:middle line:84%
reaching in and communicating
with a group of people that

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:04.540 align:middle line:84%
has this sensitivity
elevated, it must be happening

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and just people aren't
talking about it.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.192 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well-- or you're
meaning for in our community

00:27:09.192 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:90%
about what's happening.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I think that,
for example, there

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
was one person I
was talking with,

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to do this
survey on the street, that's

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:90%
what I called it.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And a lady came
back and she says

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother, who was a kid,
saw a UFO out in the cotton

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.440 align:middle line:90%
fields that flew to them.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, really?

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, did you
believe your grandmother?

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, my mother
didn't believe her but I did.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And so at that
point, I was trying

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.630 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what was the
disconnect between the mother

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't believe her mother,
but the granddaughter

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:90%
believed the grandmother.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at the age
gap between-- so the time

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.890 align:middle line:84%
that this younger person
is involved with this,

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
in religion, is a
little bankrupt.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not working out the way
most people think it would

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.580 align:middle line:84%
for them, and not
saying that it doesn't.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:84%
This opened up the
curiosity of something else

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.125 align:middle line:84%
that the grandmother
probably saw.

00:28:12.125 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it allowed her
mind to be a little loosened.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.167 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And this
is why, if you ever--

00:28:16.167 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:84%
anyone watching some of
my podcasts or things.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So you'd always end
it and I'll say,

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
your eyes are useless
when your mind is blind.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.240 align:middle line:90%
It's time to think why.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
begin to get curious

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and asked in the why
questions, then the narrative

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:90%
stays the same.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So what narrative has
been passed down anyway?

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, even through
the White community itself,

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.287 align:middle line:90%
this thing is a joke.

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
laughed at, you're

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:84%
going to end-- so
now let's say you

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:84%
stand, an African-American
person right

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.380 align:middle line:90%
next to a white person.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And the White person,
they both say us.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.913 align:middle line:90%
OK. we both saw a UFO.

00:28:54.913 --> 00:28:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's go in this
room, we're going

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:90%
to tell everybody about it.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.850 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to go first.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.725 align:middle line:84%
The white person says,
I'm going to go first.

00:29:00.725 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:84%
They go through that
door and all you hear

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.490 align:middle line:90%
is ha, boo, laughing.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And come back out,
the white person

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:90%
looks at the Black, your turn.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:90%
No, hell no.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going in there.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm not
going in there.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: You know.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.847 align:middle line:84%
Regardless, look
what they did to you.

00:29:14.847 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I watched.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I'll watch them.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.220 align:middle line:84%
A matter of fact, I
ain't telling nobody.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.600 align:middle line:90%
This is my secret.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So those are the same
things that are happening.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But then there's
something flipside to that now.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Now the stories are
becoming OK to talk about.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.370 align:middle line:84%
The stories are being
told, books, documentaries,

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.473 align:middle line:84%
but our history in
this is left out.

00:29:39.473 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and let's
talk about-- first of all,

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.057 align:middle line:84%
I want to add one
thing and then I

00:29:43.057 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:84%
want to go into the
deeper history of it.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Billy Carson.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: His aunt and
mother were abducted.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And a lot of--

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Billy feels that
a lot of what he

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.260 align:middle line:84%
was born with and a lot of his
abilities at a very young age

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:84%
were as a result of
whatever happened

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.010 align:middle line:90%
to his mom and his aunt.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, they're
Black, I'm just saying.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:84%
At least we know of a
couple of people who

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.130 align:middle line:90%
were abducted that we can name.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: There you go.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:90%
That's two.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's two.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And there's
plenty more out there.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.763 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There are plenty more.

00:30:11.763 --> 00:30:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into
the deeper history.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: OK, so
let's think about--

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:84%
first of all, I think most
people don't even know.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:84%
You ever heard the song,
(SINGING) Sweet low.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.920 align:middle line:90%
My dad used to--

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why he used to
sing me those spirituals.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But he did.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It is known
as a spiritual song.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Now I'm not validating
this totally completely,

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.780 align:middle line:84%
but I've got enough research to
validate what I'm about to say.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coming forward
to carry me home.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That was
an old slave song

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:84%
when it was in shackles
back in the day.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But just think of the context
of the word, "swing low."

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sweet chariot.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.445 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So swing low would
be identified as something

00:30:50.445 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
up above, and you want it to
swing down here and pick me up.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Then the
second phase goes in,

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
as I was watching
over the Jordan,

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.790 align:middle line:84%
these angels that
comes across the water.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:03.740 align:middle line:90%
So we know today--

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coming
to carry me home.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.297 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Coming
to carry me home.

00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, there's
probably been some abductions.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.960 align:middle line:84%
But that song is
probably originated

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:84%
from slaves seeing
extraterrestrial ships

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:90%
or something back into the day.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm still checking
deeper into it.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But most of all of our
songs are from history

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:84%
like that, is based from
some experience in reality

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:27.900 align:middle line:90%
of something.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But for the use of
context, chariot,

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and we know even back in
some of the Emerald tablets,

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:84%
all of those things
the word chariot

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.562 align:middle line:90%
was used for a spacecraft.

00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you Have
Erich von Daniken.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:38.810 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:39.768 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: There you go.

00:31:39.768 --> 00:31:41.970 align:middle line:90%
So swing low sweet chariot.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:42.770 align:middle line:90%
So please--

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Coming to get me.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Come get me, please.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Come and get
me out of this stuff.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.428 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get me out of here.

00:31:47.428 --> 00:31:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, and so
those are songs in history

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.990 align:middle line:84%
but we don't really
talk about that much.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We can go back
into the Tuskegee Airmen.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes, do.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: World War II.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The Red Tails
were these fighters

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that were well known
protecting, or the bombers.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And they became one
of those organizations

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that was actually requested due
to the fact of their record.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.910 align:middle line:84%
But in that was a
story within the story.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:22.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the Red Tails, who went
on and had a 28 year career,

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.560 align:middle line:90%
is named Robert Friend.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So he became a captain in
the US Air Force and went on.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.693 align:middle line:84%
But he actually became
the head of Blue Book.

00:32:32.693 --> 00:32:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Project Blue Book.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: From 1958 to 1963.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.605 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Now I have
watched many documents.

00:32:39.605 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And he was Black.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: And he was Black.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched many
of these stories.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I never see him in it.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You probably hear
about it one maybe time,

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.382 align:middle line:84%
but not in a full blown
story of Project Blue Book.

00:32:52.382 --> 00:32:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you know
they had that series around.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You didn't--
they didn't mention--

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I never saw him.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: One time.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:57.588 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not one time.

00:32:57.588 --> 00:33:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Now here is the
other caveat to this, Regina.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.380 align:middle line:84%
When you start
thinking about, OK it

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.370 align:middle line:84%
was a laughing matter
in 1958, it was a joke.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:84%
No one wanted to tag
their career connected

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.530 align:middle line:90%
to a UFO project.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Who or what.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And if they still needed
it, investigate it.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.865 align:middle line:90%
This is just my--

00:33:16.865 --> 00:33:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see
where you're going.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:18.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: If we're going
to ruin somebody's career--

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:21.763 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ruin someone, yeah.

00:33:21.763 --> 00:33:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's ruin his career.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Let's ruin his career.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: And we
can probably get

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.205 align:middle line:10%
him to go along with
whatever we're trying to get.

00:33:28.205 --> 00:33:29.330 align:middle line:90%
We can threaten his career.

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:84%
We can-- there's a whole
lot of possibilities.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
Hynek comes along and--

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.045 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Then
Hynek comes along.

00:33:35.045 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, after him was another
minority, Quintanilla.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't hear
about him either.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.015 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Didn't hear
about him either.

00:33:40.015 --> 00:33:42.680 align:middle line:90%
So now Hynek comes along.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And now today, because
now if the history of it

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.733 align:middle line:84%
is becoming a great thing,
that story is totally left out.

00:33:50.733 --> 00:33:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's totally left.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Now my belief
is that there was probably

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.990 align:middle line:84%
African Americans on the
same ships, the same bases,

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:84%
when all these orbs
and militaries go on,

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:90%
the abduction stories.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.920 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
were probably, again,

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:84%
left out due to the season of
the atmosphere that we were in.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And so now my job today
is trying to uncover that.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Now some people could
say, well, Roderick,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:90%
what difference does it make?

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.028 align:middle line:84%
It makes a lot of
difference because it's

00:34:18.028 --> 00:34:20.380 align:middle line:84%
going to validate
even more experiences.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Even our counterparts
and other people

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:84%
are having because now,
as Bob Salas would say,

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and he's the US captain,
one of the Minutemen

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.219 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed him and
talked to him on the phone.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:84%
He says, Roderick, he says, it's
time to trust the witnesses.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.067 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:34:37.067 --> 00:34:38.983 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: He says time
to trust the witnesses.

00:34:38.983 --> 00:34:40.150 align:middle line:90%
And if we can do that--

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including him.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Including him,
now we can get a better--

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.199 align:middle line:84%
so I think that all of these
things that's happening,

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:49.380 align:middle line:84%
all of this new disclosure,
these Amendment acts,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.889 align:middle line:84%
is now going to
validate old stories.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And let's go back and
get those stories,

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:90%
especially in the community.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I think by
having other these stories

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:84%
to surface, and then as myself
being a pioneer in this thing.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Trying to go
through the ridicule

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.480 align:middle line:84%
that I go through in most
cases, but get to be trusted.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Where more African Americans
are coming forward.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Now the stories of
history is coming.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.265 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even some
military secrets come out.

00:35:20.265 --> 00:35:22.737 align:middle line:84%
We could have the Bob
Lazars in our community

00:35:22.737 --> 00:35:23.820 align:middle line:90%
because we had scientists.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.460 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of people
that was close-minded.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And we maybe can get
more information.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:90%
And I do believe it's there.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I have been getting
phone calls now.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting emails.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I would like to get out
there bigger with it

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.840 align:middle line:84%
so that we can bring that
in, and I think it's there.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I think it's
a very valid endeavor.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:44.040 align:middle line:90%
A worthy endeavor.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, again, this
whole lack of inclusivity,

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:55.805 align:middle line:84%
even down to something like
UFO sightings and abductions,

00:35:55.805 --> 00:35:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is now getting to the point
where it's just stupid.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.560 align:middle line:84%
In this day and age, with
a production like that,

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Paul Hynek, who--

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.390 align:middle line:90%
we've had him here before too.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, for
people that aren't

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:09.248 align:middle line:84%
aware of what we're talking
about, then go to my interviews

00:36:09.248 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:84%
with Paola Harris, and talking
about Project Blue Book

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and Allen Hynek, and the
whole back story to it.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So during that series that
the History Channel aired,

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the most
watched show they ever aired.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Wow.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
they canceled it.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they canceled it.

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
just happened here?

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it actually was
getting a little truth out

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.780 align:middle line:84%
amidst all of the hyperbole
and the drama and such.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But you're right, absolutely
nothing about Robert Friend,

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.560 align:middle line:90%
or anyone else involved in that.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:84%
It was all white
military involved.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.612 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And now only
because it's popular.

00:36:46.612 --> 00:36:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
because it's popular.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: And its history.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And we
don't want to tarnish

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:54.710 align:middle line:90%
something that's important.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I deal with today

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.190 align:middle line:84%
because I try to bring a little
more humor in this, right.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So I laugh all the
time people say,

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.175 align:middle line:90%
well I had to have this report.

00:37:03.175 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, maybe women are
saying that they're being

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.880 align:middle line:90%
pregnant by extraterrestrials.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So I sit and go-OK,
well, who's going to pay

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.800 align:middle line:90%
child support for these babies?

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.570 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
They'll take me to
court in a heartbeat.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they
usually, apparently,

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.040 align:middle line:84%
take the babies from
them, so I guess they are.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But the ones
that are left here.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So imagine some woman going
and filling out some assistance

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and saying, hey, you
know daddy is an alien.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.427 align:middle line:90%
Well, it used to be, probably.

00:37:28.427 --> 00:37:30.760 align:middle line:84%
They make a phone call, we
got another one these idiots.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, we got another one.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.487 align:middle line:90%
We got another one.

00:37:33.487 --> 00:37:34.570 align:middle line:90%
What's happening out here?

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:35.300 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.650 align:middle line:90%
So we need to check into this.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And so my thing is, it's
going to be the norm.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:43.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this is
going to be the norm.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And you spoke earlier
about Valiant Thor

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and how he came
to rescue society.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And sometime on my podcast,
I'll do this audience thing.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'll ask them.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I say, OK, all of you now
are brand new on Exxon.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.540 align:middle line:84%
You haven't made
your billions yet,

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.730 align:middle line:84%
but you are just now
got on the board.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:03.625 align:middle line:84%
You're about to make
your billion dollars.

00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Another ET walks into the
board of Exxon and says,

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:84%
hey, I know you guys are
controlling oil production,

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:90%
and it's polluting the planet.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to give you this
free recipe for free energy.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.372 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, we're
clapping, congratulating.

00:38:17.372 --> 00:38:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That didn't happen.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.955 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Until
the whisper says,

00:38:19.955 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:84%
you know we're not
going to make our money.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And you start thinking,
wait a minute, free energy

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:90%
no billions.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Free energy, no billions.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Lock the door.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, free
energy, no billions.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And he's not going to get
out of the room alive.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's exactly--

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that's what happened,
is in the end,

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower said it would
bankrupt our economy.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And what other
ET in another planet

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.870 align:middle line:84%
would be told, hey,
you're going to go

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:47.967 align:middle line:90%
over there and free Earth.

00:38:47.967 --> 00:38:49.300 align:middle line:90%
He'd go, no, I'm not doing that.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.070 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the last
person that we sent there?

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.230 align:middle line:90%
He didn't come back.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, but
it's happening.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is what
I find interesting.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And this, I think, will
go across the board.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter who you are
in the world, what race you are.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.960 align:middle line:84%
We didn't listen to
any of those messages.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
there's a lot of-- there

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.660 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of different
civilizations out there

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.450 align:middle line:84%
actually pulling for
us to get through this

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:90%
and to make the right decision.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.920 align:middle line:84%
To evolve because we're, at the
core, an incredibly creative

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.720 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.708 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Absolutely.

00:39:23.708 --> 00:39:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Humans are really
beautiful and unique,

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.810 align:middle line:84%
if we can get out of our own
way on some of this dumb stuff.

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening now,
and I'm interviewing also

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:35.680 align:middle line:84%
a woman named, have interviewed,
named Dr. Linda Backman,

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.100 align:middle line:84%
psychologist, who
backed into this.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It happened kind
of accidentally.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Like most of us.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She started
hearing the stories.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
know, half the people--

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.270 align:middle line:84%
almost 60% of the clients
coming now-- she said,

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.250 align:middle line:84%
when I take them
into a regression--

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Michael Newton, you
know, "Destiny of Souls,"

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.850 align:middle line:90%
that was her mentor.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Actually, they taught together.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Wow.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 60% of these
people are saying, yeah,

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm somewhere else.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:05.365 align:middle line:84%
It looks like I
didn't start here.

00:40:05.365 --> 00:40:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're going and
remembering their lives

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.040 align:middle line:90%
on other planets.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Now my hypothesis is
because we didn't listen,

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.290 align:middle line:84%
more and more of these
entities-- anybody

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.070 align:middle line:84%
can incarnate in a
human vehicle, body.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.953 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're starting
to incarnate as humans.

00:40:18.953 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And they're very different.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.910 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be--
the next generations

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.590 align:middle line:84%
are going to be totally
different mentally,

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:25.480 align:middle line:90%
emotionally.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.990 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
learn differently.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Some will appear very
autistic and socially inept.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've
got tons of them

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:84%
incarnating all across the globe
into all of our communities.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.305 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Either
that or either--

00:40:38.305 --> 00:40:40.240 align:middle line:84%
you know how they
say that we need

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.300 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and have a little
more open in conscious?

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.885 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're turning on the tap
a little more so we remember--

00:40:46.885 --> 00:40:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think that too.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --it
more, as well, too.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only way
that they can get us to say,

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.360 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is what we do know.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is what, now, you
can remember the past, yeah.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.187 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
I'm just thinking,

00:40:59.187 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:84%
if you have more of them
incarnate-- because we're

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.740 align:middle line:90%
all from somewhere else.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, you know, so what.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.340 align:middle line:84%
If you have more of
them coming right now,

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and little saturation,
we've got to get them

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.710 align:middle line:90%
over this little bump.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.570 align:middle line:84%
We're in a little
critical phase of chaos.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's get them over
the bump and then

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:15.700 align:middle line:84%
we'll go back to where we came
from and others will incarnate.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.902 align:middle line:84%
But just enough to seed
really important concepts.

00:41:19.902 --> 00:41:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But I think religion
will double down on that too

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:22.660 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.993 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I think they will.

00:41:23.993 --> 00:41:25.327 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: They will double down.

00:41:25.327 --> 00:41:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
already losing ground.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:84%
It is losing ground
because it's pedantic

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and not allowing
for any other story.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And that for the
better and the worse,

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.360 align:middle line:84%
the world's moving on
to other stories too.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But I have a
question for you though.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Have you thought about--

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I meet a lot of people
that are Starseeds.

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I'm talking about.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:48.325 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah,
and they discover

00:41:48.325 --> 00:41:49.650 align:middle line:90%
that they're Starseeds.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But then in the beginning,
they was confused.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.920 align:middle line:84%
They were feeling, like you
said before, out of place.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.660 align:middle line:84%
They didn't belong
here and all of this.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of times
they'll have weird birth defects

00:42:00.035 --> 00:42:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and disorders physically.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So my question is
why would the extraterrestrial

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.390 align:middle line:84%
allow that to happen
to the Starseeds

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:14.170 align:middle line:84%
if they are that meeting in
between where we're going?

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Why would they give
them so much confusion?

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.935 align:middle line:84%
Why would they allow
this to the chosen of--

00:42:20.935 --> 00:42:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hear you.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think if you're
going to incarnate as human--

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you're coming in
with the same lack of memory

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.060 align:middle line:90%
as everyone else.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.185 align:middle line:90%
You all get the same thing.

00:42:28.185 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:90%
You don't remember a thing.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to figure
it out once you get here.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And the ones who are,
perhaps, a little closer

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of higher mind
can remember more quickly.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.938 align:middle line:84%
Others are just
confused till something.

00:42:39.938 --> 00:42:42.480 align:middle line:84%
They get in a car wreck at 30,
and then they see their people

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.410 align:middle line:90%
and remember why they're here.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean what a mess.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not an efficient way
to do things, I don't think.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's not.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's like that's
the confusion of it.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if you're a soul
though who doesn't know war,

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.750 align:middle line:90%
and who doesn't division.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:58.380 align:middle line:10%
If you're a soul who only
understands collaboration

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.020 align:middle line:10%
and love and
helping one another,

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.190 align:middle line:10%
and you're incarnating
into physical body,

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.190 align:middle line:10%
you're not going to bring
any of those imprints,

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:07.107 align:middle line:10%
you're not going to
resonate with any of that.

00:43:07.107 --> 00:43:08.940 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
a society that's more

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.950 align:middle line:90%
collaborative and peaceful.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think more of those
beings are being born also

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:18.120 align:middle line:84%
with high technology that
is going to be needed here.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Free energy, we
already know it's here.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.327 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we know that
they could have had it ages ago

00:43:23.327 --> 00:43:25.662 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't to disrupt our
economic structures at work.

00:43:25.662 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It will
probably-- you're

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.470 align:middle line:84%
talking free energy will break
the world down as we know it.

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You're talking global,
I mean jobs and secure--

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.870 align:middle line:90%
everything will just--

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:40.712 align:middle line:84%
And there was just a big
event a couple of months

00:43:40.712 --> 00:43:46.020 align:middle line:84%
ago in Silicon Valley where
they showed a cold fusion

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:90%
operational little device.

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
a few days later,

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I think JPL or something
came out with their own.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.160 align:middle line:90%
We've got ours.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Going into competition already.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.540 align:middle line:90%
The point is, it's already here.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.340 align:middle line:90%
So anyway--

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We can use
the term that says,

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.242 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
ever see the light.

00:44:03.242 --> 00:44:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well,
let's hope it does.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think some
of the new people,

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of those new
people being born are us,

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.280 align:middle line:84%
we're just recycling
ourselves too.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And people
like yourself.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, allowing
other people to come.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Sharing your platform.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Allowing the message
to be reached.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:23.125 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the stir of,
not a revolt, but just change.

00:44:23.125 --> 00:44:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Transformation.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I think
this world needs it.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of humans.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So you are
doing an awesome job.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why, thank you.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:29.710 align:middle line:90%
And so are you, my friend.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.030 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.843 align:middle line:84%
Any final thought
before we sign off here?

00:44:32.843 --> 00:44:35.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Well, other than
that, just tell everyone,

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:38.370 align:middle line:10%
your eyes are useless
when your mind is blind.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.600 align:middle line:90%
You have to think, why.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get past the
point where we see things

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.820 align:middle line:84%
but our mind won't
let us interpret it.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can
work there, then we

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.030 align:middle line:84%
can understand we can see better
through these narratives as

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:52.790 align:middle line:84%
well as the future
that we need to go.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't mean we
have to give up our faith.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the beautiful
and amazing forces

00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.730 align:middle line:90%
that are here to help us.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the creator.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to give
up faith in any of that.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In order to be more
inclusive of the vastness

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.820 align:middle line:90%
of what is.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And openly, it won't
be a Black and white thing.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.910 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: It will be an
extraterrestrial, new life,

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.170 align:middle line:10%
new horizon.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And both sides can say, you know
what, this is for all of us.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And these
ETs will probably

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.607 align:middle line:90%
say, you all are one people.

00:45:23.607 --> 00:45:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's right, because
that's the message in the end.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That would be
the message in the end.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.492 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Roderick, thank
you so much for taking time

00:45:29.492 --> 00:45:29.680 align:middle line:90%
to be here.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Thank
you for having me.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're so welcome.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: All right.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For more
of Roderick's work,

00:45:33.443 --> 00:45:36.300 align:middle line:84%
you can go to his YouTube
channel, Why the Big Secret.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
