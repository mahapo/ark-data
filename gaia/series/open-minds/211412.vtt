[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
Has the human race

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.140 align:middle line:84%
been hijacked by
an alien species?

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is a really
legitimate question.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:84%
It was always the intention
of our spiritual forbearers

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:84%
that we would develop ourselves
organically and evolve

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:90%
into a human, angelic hybrid.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:84%
These reports, that
Department of Commerce

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:84%
report, a NASA report,
make it absolutely clear

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
planned transformation

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.398 align:middle line:90%
of the human species.

00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:35.815 align:middle line:84%
Five years ago, I wouldn't
have been talking about demons.

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Oh,
they'll admit they're there,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and they are affecting
us and influencing us.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Without a doubt.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.437 align:middle line:84%
That's the predicament
all of us are in.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:84%
We have an awakening experience,
be it some a health issue,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:90%
career issue, family whatever.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly now,
we're in it, and we

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
need to know what is possible
and what we can ultimately

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:90%
achieve.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
We're being told to sit down and
shut up that we're the problem.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're not the problem,
we're part of the solution.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.707 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: According
to William Henry,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:10%
we're at a choice point as to
what kind of ascension humanity

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:10%
will be making pink or gray.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by this
is that humankind

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
can evolve organically as we
have throughout millennia,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.710 align:middle line:84%
or we can have the
heavy hand of AI

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
evolve us into something
entirely different.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:90%
We need to know what's at stake.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:90%
William, welcome back.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:90%
It's so good--

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Thank you.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --to see you again.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: So good
to see you, Regina.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You never change,
and you're always just--

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:84%
you're just a wonderful
sparkle in the studio.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Thank you.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
time, we're going

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.198 align:middle line:84%
to talk about a little
bit of heavy stuff

00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
along with ascension because
we have something that

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
could certainly thwart
that for a good percentage

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And with some people's
views on it, all of humanity

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.200 align:middle line:90%
ultimately is going to make it.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
including yourself.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.035 align:middle line:90%
That's the spoiler alert.

00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:49.835 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: However it can be
easier or much more difficult

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.095 align:middle line:84%
and much longer,
depending on the path.

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:84%
What's a great movie without
a great villain, right.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a great
villain on the planet

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:84%
with us right now
living in our homes,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:84%
taking our children
away from us,

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
taking our humanity away from
us, and people are like going,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
oh but oh, it does
everything for me.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a convenience,
it's an addiction.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.655 align:middle line:84%
It has changed the way our
youth's brains are developing.

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:22.455 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:02:22.455 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know I talked
to Sheila Gillette and the Theo

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:90%
group about this and--

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:84%
because I was talking
to them in this way.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
well, you just have

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:84%
to understand kind of
looking at the meta-view

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
from wherever they
are, yeah, it's bad.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:84%
However, this is what happens
where the pendulum has

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to hit it and knock it one
way before it can go back

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
the other, it's how
far-- how much further

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:90%
can the pendulum go?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.868 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so-- and that's
what you're looking into.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's first talk about
what the potential is.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the potential
of an ascended consciousness

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
for all of humanity to keep
step with Mother Earth.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, exactly.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:10%
This was always the intention
of our spiritual forbearers

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:10%
that we would develop ourselves
organically and evolve

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.385 align:middle line:10%
into a human, angelic hybrid.

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:10.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:10.185 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That was the goal.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
A perfected humanity
they referred to.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:10%
And perfect means to be
more whole, more holy, more

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:10%
complete, and more
compassionate.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.405 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened in the
middle of the 20th century

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
is that the technology people
got ahold of this and said,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
oh no, a perfect
human is one who's

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.378 align:middle line:90%
packed full of nanotechnology--

00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And never dies.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --and never dies and
is linked up to everybody else

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:90%
and has no free will and has--

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Superhuman strength.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --superhuman
strength, all of that.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this is
Satan taking Jesus up

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the pinnacle
of Solomon's temple

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and saying all
this can be yours.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.265 align:middle line:90%
Just give us your soul.

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say
no, I don't think so.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And this
isn't hyperbole--

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.668 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not.

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --because we recognize
through the statements

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
of the developers of
artificial intelligence

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and all of this technology
that they themselves

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
refer to it as demonic,
as alien, as non-human.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:90%
And it is, in fact, anti-human.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It's anti-human, it's
anti-God, it's anti-Christ.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
It's-- and this is what we're
seeing in our society now is

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
this sort of lawlessness taking
over where humans do not matter

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:90%
any more in this context.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, and we're
up to such a breakdown

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
in all spiritual paths
that mental illness

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:90%
that has taken over.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.335 align:middle line:84%
Some by design,
some organically.

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're seeing what a
mass shooting almost every day

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.455 align:middle line:84%
Which we predicted
a few years ago--

00:04:36.455 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Sure.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.347 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --it was
going to go that way.

00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:39.585 align:middle line:90%
And it's not stopping.

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:40.385 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right now,
it's not stopping.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: But all of us
are participants too.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not bystanders
or bystanders in this.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.635 align:middle line:84%
We're actively participating
with every click, every time

00:04:50.635 --> 00:04:52.385 align:middle line:84%
we use the phone, every
time we're using--

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --the
computer we're building

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
this intelligence that is
ultimately not for our benefit.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And so that puts the power back
into the hand of the users who

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:84%
are able to say, well, maybe
I can limit what I'm doing,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
or I can press these
companies to be regulated.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:84%
This is before Congress today
where one of these shills

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:84%
for AI is before
Congress saying, oh yeah,

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
my product is dangerous,
and it's unpredictable,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what it's
all-- it's harmful but--

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, a lot of
the developers have come out

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and said that.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: They have.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, they have.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
They're like rats
fleeing a ship.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They've
grown a conscience.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.073 align:middle line:84%
They're all now watching
Netflix sitting at home in the--

00:05:28.073 --> 00:05:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "The
Social Dilemma" was

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:84%
a good documentary indicating
how they use our algorithms

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.535 align:middle line:84%
and the way they suck
people in unnaturally.

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is--
if you had told us

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.528 align:middle line:84%
that there was going to be a
predator coming on the planet,

00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't have picked
a better predator.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.612 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we've got here.

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And humanity has not had a
predator for, say, 10,000 years

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:84%
or more apart from
ourselves, but now we do.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have to recognize that
and treat it as a predator.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I'm going
to read this here.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
A report from US National
Science Foundation Commerce

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Department.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Science Foundation/Commerce
Department.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So when I read that, first
of all, it's like, what?

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.430 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially saying
that what's happening

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:90%
is they're merging bits right?

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Computers, atoms,
nanotechnology, neurons,

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:84%
neuroscience, and
genes DNA into one

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
seamless tech spoken of as
a utopian new golden era.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So expand
on this for us

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and what's really going down
in the field of science.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.042 align:middle line:84%
Which obviously is for
commercial development.

00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:34.875 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's all
for gain by a handful.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:90%
And that report was from 2002.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
That was the US Department
of Commerce gathering

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
all the big tech
players together

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that were in existence then
saying we want all of you

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to merge your technologies
into one technology aimed

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
at the human body to introduce
a new species of machine

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
intelligence to create
wealth beyond imagination

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:90%
and a new golden age.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:90%
That's their terminology.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, wait.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Wealth for whom?

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, wealth
for whom exactly.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:84%
This is not going
to be for everybody.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
The majority of people
will lose their job.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And this will happen
in the next few years.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And you will then be given
your minimal sustenance

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:90%
from the government.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.032 align:middle line:90%
They'll take your cash away.

00:07:16.032 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we already
know that's coming.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going
to just say you deserve,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
based on our social credit
system we're implementing,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
you deserve this standard
of living, and that's it.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And there will be no more of
what we know of as capitalism,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be pure
communism planet wide.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, so give
us some ideas now.

00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think all of us can
probably draw a few examples

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:84%
to mind of how those
technologies they spoke about

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
in 2002 are actually playing
out in the world of science

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:90%
and human enhancement.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Right, the idea
is that they don't even

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
have to put implants
in us anymore,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:90%
they can do it from a distance.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
These algorithms are
controlling us already.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:84%
They know us better
than we know ourselves.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's an invisible
form of manipulation

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:84%
as well as the overt
form of manipulation.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.522 align:middle line:84%
And what concerns me
most is that these

00:08:04.522 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
reports that
Department of Commerce

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:84%
report, a NASA report that
was two years older than that

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:90%
said exactly the same thing.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Make it absolutely
clear that this

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:84%
is a planned transformation
of the human species driven

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:90%
by the US military.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, well, why
is the military driving this?

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And who are they
actually answering to?

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.205 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who are they serving?

00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, I mean,
has the human race been

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:90%
hijacked by an alien species?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a really
legitimate question.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And something
people often ask me

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
was if you had a chance to meet
an extraterrestrial, an alien,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
what question would
you ask them first.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And one would be are you AI?

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And if not, how did
you transcend AI?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone
from Stephen Hawking

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:84%
on down has been
telling us this is

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:84%
the foremost existential
threat to humanity.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And it might not
even be Earthly.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.582 align:middle line:84%
So we all have to recognize
this side of it that this is--

00:08:56.582 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is not sci-fi.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.138 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: This is not sci-fi.

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:90%
This is the Book of Revelation.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I believe.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Without a doubt,
this is the dragon,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.310 align:middle line:84%
this is the mark
of the beast, this

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
is the image of the
beast technology.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the time
of Revelation, to reveal.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.883 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
the beauty of it.

00:09:11.883 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:84%
It is the time to reveal, and
we have the very mechanisms

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that can ensnare us into
that world are the ones that

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:84%
can also distribute
information like we're doing

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:90%
right now that humanity needs.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:84%
You obviously have a
double-edged sword there.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, we do.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
takes discernment.

00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It truly does.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.682 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And discipline.

00:09:30.682 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And a recognition that
we have a spiritual ability

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:90%
within us to combat this.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
That we can raise our
ascension intelligence,

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:84%
become more like the
angels, and transcend

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
challenge right now.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is the promise of
the Book of Revelation is that

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:45.077 align:middle line:90%
there's--

00:09:45.077 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --a small
number of people,

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:84%
they're referred
to as the 144,000,

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
who don't take the
mark of the beast

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.305 align:middle line:84%
and don't worship the
image of the beast that

00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:90%
defeat that beast.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On behalf of all.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: On behalf of all.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it doesn't
mean the rest of us

00:09:59.443 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
need to go to sleep
or not do our part.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We all have to fuel that
field of consciousness that

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:90%
is organic and has--

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
when you glimpse

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
into it and in my
hermetic studies

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.980 align:middle line:84%
the fourth realm or the Elysian
Fields, when you look at that,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:84%
it is the perfected
template of Earth

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
where we appear to be
like human-hybrid-angels.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.185 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where the emotions
have been soothed and calmed

00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:90%
and are used in a proper way--

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --instead of
manipulated like they are now.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.153 align:middle line:84%
And just one-- first answer
that or comment to that

00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing about
how emotions are running

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and
manipulated, then

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go into
another little piece.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
We're just going
to go for it here.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.215 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:10:40.215 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's so much.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, I mean, that's
what the news is, right.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just emotional
manipulation.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not a
presentation of facts.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply
manipulating people

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.853 align:middle line:84%
based on beliefs and
their social bubble

00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:84%
that we talked
about a moment ago.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.307 align:middle line:84%
And that's very juicy and
addictive for people--

00:10:57.307 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, it is.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to reinforce
these neural networks

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and literally create a stronger
and stronger impression where

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:90%
we're less flexible, less open.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:90%
We become more siloed and rigid.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:84%
The more we repeat reinforcing
these same messages

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves or listen
to others reinforce it,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think most
people really understand

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
the danger of listening
to the same talk

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
show hosts spouting
the same garbage,

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what side
you're on, over and over.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens when we
become inflexible and brittle?

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, precisely.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it's up to the individual
then, as you said a moment ago,

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:84%
discernment, education,
understanding

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:84%
the power of this
moment, stepping into it,

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:90%
and stepping up.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, so when
you're talking about some

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:84%
of-- the technology
is very sexy.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, it is.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
when someone can say,

00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:84%
hey, we can send
a nanobot in there

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.185 align:middle line:84%
and repair this damage to the
heart, who's going to say no?

00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, who's going to
say yes to you being

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.970 align:middle line:84%
able to do that it would be
my question because it's not

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:03.835 align:middle line:90%
a free lunch, OK.

00:12:03.835 --> 00:12:04.635 align:middle line:90%
None of this--

00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: --is a free lunch.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.570 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is give over your--

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.593 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: All you have to do
is give over your free will,

00:12:09.593 --> 00:12:12.540 align:middle line:84%
your ability to consciously
decide for yourself

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and participate in a
social credit system.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Something like Facebook is
designed and implemented

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.035 align:middle line:84%
for China is already
in place here

00:12:19.035 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:90%
and it's already happening.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So tell us about that.

00:12:21.493 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
How has that rolled out
in China and other places

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
where if you want these
privileged new technologies

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that will help you
preserve your lifespan

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and potentially the quality
of your life as well,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.813 align:middle line:90%
what do you have to buy into?

00:12:32.813 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Is it-- where has
it been enacted?

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, it's China.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and it's more
fundamental than things

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.890 align:middle line:84%
like amortality
and life extension

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and those sorts of things, it's
your basic fundamentals of life

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
that are challenged
by this system.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're stepping
into right now and recognizing

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, if you're not
with us, you're against us.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:90%
That's their position.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:90%
They're making it very clear.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here in the
USA, it hasn't really

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
taken effect seemingly
to the same extent

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:90%
it has in some other places.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.393 align:middle line:84%
You can still make
your own decision

00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
as to how you're
going to proceed,

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.352 align:middle line:84%
who you want to do
your banking with,

00:13:12.352 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:84%
whether you want to invest and
we'll get into that in a moment

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:84%
or not or whether you want
to put your money in a tin

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:84%
can in the backyard, we
still have all those options

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
here because money is
still being printed.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't have to
have chips in our arms yet.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Yet.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- the options
are not going like this,

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:90%
the options are going like this.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
what that looks like.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.817 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I mean, what
it looks like ultimately

00:13:33.817 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:84%
is the individual relinquishing
all their power just

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:90%
to stay alive.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- that's a
frightening prospect,

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and we don't-- that's not what
our government was created

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that means that
our government is really

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:90%
not our government.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It's serving something
or somebody else.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We'll go back to John
Warner's statement there--

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.625 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --what it's serving.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Which is very
interesting because I

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:84%
deal with a lot of
channelers on my show

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and I have my own beings.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's been fascinating
to me one common thread,

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter who they
are, including mine, when I

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.650 align:middle line:90%
say who is doing this and why?

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They're like almost like maybe
best you don't know quite yet.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And they won't talk about
the nature of the beings.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
No one's channels will talk
about the nature of the beings.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And partly, I've
come to understand

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
they don't want our attention
focused that way on them.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
They want it focused on what
we can do in our personal lives

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:84%
to claim our sovereignty
and organic nature.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want us
focusing on what they are.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've always thought,
why won't you just tell us?

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I can't
get any of them to.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because-- there's
no evil agenda with them

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:90%
that I can see.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.737 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, I mean,
I didn't used to really,

00:14:55.737 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
like five years ago, I wouldn't
have been talking about demons

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, they'll
admit they're there,

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and they are affecting
us and influencing us.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Without a doubt.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.202 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And I started
paying attention

00:15:05.202 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:84%
to it just listening, as we
said a moment ago to some

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:11.117 align:middle line:84%
of these AI technologists from
Elon Musk and Geordie Rose who

00:15:11.117 --> 00:15:13.450 align:middle line:84%
builds the quantum computers,
they're the ones that were

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
saying this is what this is.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.265 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, Elon Musk
has come out slamming it.

00:15:17.265 --> 00:15:19.765 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about the potential
dangers of what he created.

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:90%
They all are.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And so that means
we need a map to navigate

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.072 align:middle line:90%
through what is transpiring.

00:15:28.072 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
really looking more heavily

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
at the Book of Revelation
as the guidebook for what

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:90%
is going on here.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Because why is it--

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
a few years ago,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
there was a Chinese
economist who

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
was talking to a group
of Chinese people.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:84%
This was before the
election in 2020.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said oh,
we're not worried

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:84%
about the election
in 2020, we've

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.285 align:middle line:90%
got old friends in Washington.

00:15:49.285 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what do
you mean, old friends.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
You used to smoke pot
together in college,

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.713 align:middle line:84%
or do you mean
like old friends--

00:15:54.713 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Old friends.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --like cosmic
sort of friends.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And you all are--

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.340 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter if you're
Mark Zuckerberg growing up

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:84%
in wherever he
grew up in America,

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:84%
or you're some
Chinese Communist,

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
you all subscribe ultimately
to another entity.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And I started
to just see it that way,

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and it was kind of revolting
at first to think, well, wait

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.928 align:middle line:90%
a minute is this really true?

00:16:17.928 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And then it was quite ultimately
revelatory because it gave me

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:84%
a pathway through and a
recognition that in 2020 hey,

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.920 align:middle line:84%
we might want to
pay attention here.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.750 align:middle line:84%
There could be something
coming along the pike

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
here that might look like
the image of the beast

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:90%
or the mark of the beast.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And some people would
argue that was what we saw

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:90%
in 2020 as a march up to that.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: A preamble,
if not the real thing.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:90%
It started.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And so that means,
well, OK, if it started,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.482 align:middle line:84%
we really want to
pay attention here.

00:16:44.482 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so then you ultimately
have to decide, how am I

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:90%
going to navigate this.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the organic
ascension teachings come in

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
because they speak
of the 144,000

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Revelation
that activate what they

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:90%
refer to as the seal of God.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:84%
This is, I think, the
light body activation.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
This is awakening the organic
potential of the pineal gland.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:84%
The release of secretions
that transmute our body that

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
boost our immune
system that ultimately

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
put our spiritual
capacity within our hands

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to manipulate
what's going on out here.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.770 align:middle line:84%
This is like the perennial
kind of question for humanity.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Do we use technology,
or we don't?

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying we don't
use technology at all.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
using it right now.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.339 align:middle line:84%
That's why everybody's
watching us.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:28.889 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:17:28.889 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So and there's many
benefits to AI, of course.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Medical research, all
kinds of things like that.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But this is the ultimate--
this goes back Book of Genesis.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
You have Cain and Abel, first
two children of Adam and Eve

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:90%
in the story.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And then Cain, after
murdering Abel,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:84%
is sent off to the Land
of Nod, which we don't

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:90%
know where that is exactly.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's a, this nebulous kind
of a place, but what he does

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:90%
is he starts using technology.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:90%
He starts building cities.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:84%
He starts implementing
weights and measures,

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and his family becomes known
as Smiths and developers

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.320 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And I look at that
story, and I think, well,

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that is kind of the
perennial conflict,

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.450 align:middle line:84%
isn't it whether, to use
the technology or not.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And very clearly, in
the Book of Genesis,

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:84%
the commentary is saying
if you're using technology,

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:84%
there's a bifurcation
that's going to take place.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And you all can go
off to the Land of Nod

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and do this yourself.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So Elon and all those
guys go to Mars.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Turn it into an AI planet.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Turn yourselves and
your children into AI.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Leave ours alone.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: OK.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
all they're doing

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
is saying you
sacrifice your children

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:90%
on the altar of our technology.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
We're not letting our
kids anywhere near this.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.862 align:middle line:84%
So the hypocrisy
is just astounding.

00:18:39.862 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's true that
something is occurring

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:90%
to me when you say this.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is, since
human beings came

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:84%
to be the wonderful
weird hybrid species we

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:84%
are that's on a trajectory
of learning and experience,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.740 align:middle line:84%
we're still in school,
there's one thing

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:90%
that's been consistent.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:84%
We have always wanted
to push it further.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
wanted to gauge

00:19:00.925 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:90%
our-- engage our intellect.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Right and technology, even the
early technologies, weights

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and measures gained
form and structure

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.430 align:middle line:84%
for the development
of the intellect--

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: True.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and to navigate
the physical reality.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It's within humans to push
those barriers no matter what.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, right.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And just to put the
other shoe on that,

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I like the Mormon
belief about Enoch too.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the first city that
was built by the descendants

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:90%
of Cain was called Enoch.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
another line of Enoch.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Enoch
who ascended and used

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.940 align:middle line:84%
all his organic abilities
and worked with the angels

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and was supposed to have created
a whole city that ultimately

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:90%
ascended--

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As opposed to Enlil.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --and will
be coming back.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, as
opposed to Enlil.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
this idea that, OK,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start seeing
the appearance of those guys,

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:84%
the good guys that
previously ascended long ago,

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.590 align:middle line:90%
will be returning at this time.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe they have.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: They could well do.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are
speaking all the time.

00:20:03.748 --> 00:20:07.320 align:middle line:84%
That impulse that we're getting
where I don't know about people

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:84%
watching this or you, but
are you going through the day

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, and it's like
there's a blast of light,

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:84%
almost like a feeling, almost
like a utopian blissful

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
feeling out of nowhere that is
just this beautiful reality.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It just flashes in, and
it's like, oh my gosh,

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.697 align:middle line:90%
and then it goes away.

00:20:25.697 --> 00:20:26.497 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:20:26.497 --> 00:20:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just-- it's
like a bleed-through

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:84%
of this fourth realm
or other realm.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think too
about the rise of psilocybin,

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
for example, in our world as
a way of opening up the heart.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: And suddenly,
as being de-scheduled,

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.880 align:middle line:10%
it's being legalized in various
cities around the US right now

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:10%
and will be descheduled
by the federal government.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.645 align:middle line:84%
This could be one of these
wild card sort of things

00:20:52.645 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:90%
that's coming on the scene.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:54.687 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It could be.

00:20:54.687 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But you don't think it's on the
tail of the whole LSD movement

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
originally with the
intelligence communities?

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.825 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, here again.

00:21:00.825 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it, is it not?

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Psilocybin is natural.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:90%
It's organic.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.565 align:middle line:84%
And you can find
it in a mushroom

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
underneath a pine tree,
or you can manufacture it

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.135 align:middle line:90%
synthetically.

00:21:09.135 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm wondering, do you
think that, though, is truly

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:84%
a more organic movement
to allow people

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:84%
to start expressing the feelings
that have been suppressed

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:90%
by society at large?

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what it
does is it releases you

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.337 align:middle line:90%
from old brain patterns too.

00:21:24.337 --> 00:21:25.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what John Hopkins--

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I did
it a couple times

00:21:26.795 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and ended up frozen in space
because my knees wouldn't work,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
but I'm like, I'll
practically shouting

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:90%
I love you to every passerby.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And I mean that is
a hopeful scenario.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Millions of people will
begin using this or activating

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:84%
latent spiritual abilities
and will wash the planet

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:84%
with compassion, and
that will have an effect

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:90%
like we can't even comprehend.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
hopeful scenario.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's even made its way into
some of the braver television

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:84%
programming where
the main characters

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:90%
are microdosing to good effect.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is-- when
I saw that, I thought,

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.460 align:middle line:90%
who let that in?

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
How did that get
through the analysis

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.743 align:middle line:84%
and not have a line
through it, right?

00:22:10.743 --> 00:22:11.543 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:22:11.543 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, but
it's starting to be

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:84%
shown as acceptable among
professional, intelligent

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Totally, totally.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So-- and
you've tried it.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely astounding.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And I'm
looking for ways--

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I've had a feeling recently of
like a dolphin in an aquarium

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
at some sort of a
museum or whatever

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and bumping up against the glass
trying to get out, and expand

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.020 align:middle line:90%
and that's my motivation.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.413 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: As well as
to open the heart.

00:22:43.413 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And because that is the
order of the day right now.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:84%
That is within the
capacity of all

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
of us is to become more
compassionate, more

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:90%
loving, and accepting.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
world, and you

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:58.342 align:middle line:84%
say archons attach to
it whoever they may be,

00:22:58.342 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:84%
or whatever form they're
in, wherever they came from,

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.360 align:middle line:90%
whatever dimension.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And I want to talk about that.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
There from, have
every vested interest

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to see that we don't find
our way out of the aquarium.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's reflected
in everything being offered

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:90%
and served up to us.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Not everything but a lot
that's being served up

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.800 align:middle line:84%
in the media that appeals
to the lower nature.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting to me is
the dimensional aspect of this.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking about
the fourth realm,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:84%
the higher realm
in hermetic terms,

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
which is where we're
expanding into after the Earth

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.795 align:middle line:84%
experience for humans
where we move into.

00:23:34.795 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:84%
You have foregoers who
are prepping the way

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and coming back and
holding hands for others

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:90%
to pass over now.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These other
beings are at play here.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk
about how you see

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:90%
the dimensional fold of this?

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, I mean, from
the Gnostic perspective,

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:84%
they always-- you mentioned
the archons a moment ago.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:84%
They're always the
nemesis that are trying

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:90%
to take over our humanity.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
souls, they want ours.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the ultimate
playbook that's--

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not that different--

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: --not that different.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
the archons is to put

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:90%
on your full armor of God.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.560 align:middle line:84%
To your crown of
salvation, your breastplate

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.060 align:middle line:84%
of righteousness, your belt of
truth, your sandals of peace,

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and let your faith
be your shield.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Those can't be
exterior augmentations

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
because when Paul, the
apostle Paul for example,

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:84%
is stating that we're
in a cosmic battle

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:84%
against these archons
and that is the remedy,

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:84%
he's writing to the first
Christian community,

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.383 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't have
hiked it down to Nordstrom

00:24:32.383 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:84%
to get the latest Chanel
belt and Gucci shoes.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: These must be
symbols that he's speaking of.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
To activate our consciousness,
open our hearts,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:90%
speak truth, walk in peace.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And to raise our Kundalini,
ultimately the Holy Spirit

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:50.740 align:middle line:84%
So that is saying that we're
all capable of suiting up

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:84%
here and transcending and
defeating these lower entities.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, we become
higher beings ourselves.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rudolf
Steiner, same thing.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Ahriman and the other forces.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, right.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rudolf Steiner writes
volumes about this as well

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:90%
in his beautiful work.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So then this comes
into another question.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember once a few
decades ago, my guide said,

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, humans have not
gotten to the point where they

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:84%
learn the larger lessons
through pleasure,

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:84%
they learn through
pain and pressure.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, I don't think we
can argue with that.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we are.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.165 align:middle line:90%
They weren't being judgmental.

00:25:31.165 --> 00:25:31.965 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it begs the
question when you're talking

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:84%
about these other forces
just like Lucifer--

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --fallen angel, right.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:40.825 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:25:40.825 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think there's
some kind of larger agreement

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.710 align:middle line:84%
that someone plays that
role opposite the role--

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
the opposite role
of creation creator

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
so that all beings
within the universes

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
have the opportunity to be put
under some kind of pressure

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:90%
to see what we grow into?

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.158 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, I think that--

00:26:01.158 --> 00:26:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I really like that
idea a lot because we

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.060 align:middle line:84%
do need that challenger
and the oppressor.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:84%
These are terms the
advocate-- these are

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.910 align:middle line:90%
all terms for Lucifer or Satan.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.712 align:middle line:84%
That's the function
of that office.

00:26:14.712 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean--
advocate means lawyer.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:17.815 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:26:17.815 --> 00:26:18.648 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In French.

00:26:18.648 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah Yeah, exactly.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
curious that those

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.428 align:middle line:84%
are the titles or roles that
are played by this figure to--

00:26:25.428 --> 00:26:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't mean--
sorry any lawyers,

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean to insult you.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, right.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:90%
You're not all Satan.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
But to prompt humanity
to move and to shift,

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.480 align:middle line:84%
that is kind of the ultimate
benevolent aspect of what is--

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in a sense,
there's balance and order even

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:90%
in the ugliest--

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I think so.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that's
expressing itself here?

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.562 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
a natural order

00:26:46.562 --> 00:26:49.430 align:middle line:84%
in the lower realms trying to
reach in and feed, get what

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:90%
they can, learn what they can.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.433 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately maybe try
to leap up a rung.

00:26:53.433 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:90%
There's order in that.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:84%
There's order in the angelic
realms reaching into us

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:90%
and saying, here's a hand.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I want to help you out.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Dream of me, and I'll help you.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But we still have
to go through it.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we have
to go through it.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'm
seeing, and that's

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.835 align:middle line:84%
where I really am wondering
about this second realm

00:27:08.835 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:84%
intervention, archonic
intervention, whatever you,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
whichever, whatever, it
might all go together,

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:84%
is the amount of psychosis,
narcissism, meanness,

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and lack of care that
is expressing itself

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.003 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our grandmothers and
fathers would be horrified,

00:27:25.003 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
have an easy life.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of spousal
abuse and all that.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Sure.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the general way
in which we treated each other

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:90%
was more civilized.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, and
this is, I think,

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:84%
attributed to AI and
the dehumanization that

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.750 align:middle line:90%
you're just--

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
you're not really a
human being, you're

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:84%
just another part of
this AI machine now.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And as AI rises, so does this
narcissism and all of those

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:84%
attributes that
you just described.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.265 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a one-to-one
correlation in my mind

00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:84%
that you can just
witness for yourself.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.085 align:middle line:90%
It's this is happening.

00:27:56.085 --> 00:27:58.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's happening
in families everywhere.

00:27:58.085 --> 00:27:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, because all
your kids are doing is this.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're like, what
happened to my kid, you know.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:02.088 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:02.088 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you also wrote that
for transhumanists, the soul is

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:90%
nothing more than an algorithm.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And transhumanists, generally
speaking, are sectarian.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:84%
They do not have
spiritual practice,

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:84%
they're terrified of dying
because once the body

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:90%
disintegrates, you end.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.192 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is no-- for
them, in their own beliefs,

00:28:20.192 --> 00:28:22.609 align:middle line:84%
there's no soul, so now they've
put it out as a philosophy

00:28:22.609 --> 00:28:24.359 align:middle line:84%
that we're nothing
more than an algorithm.

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's it.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.730 align:middle line:84%
They had to redefine the
definition of the word soul

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.190 align:middle line:90%
and to just information data.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.180 align:middle line:90%
You're just matter.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:90%
And darling, you don't.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the fact of the matter
from their perspective.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:90%
You're just information.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
you're in this container

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:84%
or if you-- we put you
in a container like this,

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:90%
it's still you.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you your soul
just all those photos,

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
all those phone
calls we've recorded,

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.792 align:middle line:90%
all those cameras that we--

00:28:49.792 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:90%
all the video we take of you.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We can recreate you.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.812 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We can recreate
you, and it's still you.

00:28:53.812 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:90%
That is your soul.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:90%
That information is your soul.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.707 align:middle line:90%
That's their argument.

00:28:57.707 --> 00:28:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And they had to make
that argument because--

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of course,
they have to because they

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:90%
don't believe in a soul.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Precisely.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When you look--

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Don't believe in God.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you
go-- yeah, you go back

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.170 align:middle line:84%
into the transhumanist movement
and look at the players,

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:90%
these are not religious people.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:07.895 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: They are not.

00:29:07.895 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
not spiritual people.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.823 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Not at all.

00:29:09.823 --> 00:29:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here we are
now we're with this big mess

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.290 align:middle line:84%
that our kids and our
grandkids and ourselves

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:90%
are having to contend with.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at now
the reverse of that.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
The various things that
we can do for-- we've

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:84%
already talked about reclaiming
yourself and using technology

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.890 align:middle line:90%
in a very discerning way.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:28.708 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:29:28.708 --> 00:29:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're
going to choose a show,

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:90%
choose a show with heart.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going
to use your computer,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:84%
make sure you're using
it for specific purposes,

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.825 align:middle line:84%
not just wandering around
aimlessly and sucking up time.

00:29:41.825 --> 00:29:43.825 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are all
things within our control.

00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we have another
problem, and that is the kids.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And parents have
become increasingly

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.530 align:middle line:84%
fearful of their own
children in terms

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
of exerting any kind of, I
don't even want to use the word

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:90%
discipline, guidance.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Just saying, hey, no.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't do that all day.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And then the
other side of that,

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
too, is the argument
I hear is that, oh,

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:84%
these kids are different,
and they've come in for this.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they're better
equipped to handle it.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to wait around and
see what happens in 20 years

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:12.650 align:middle line:90%
once these kids grow up.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No we
still-- we have--

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.445 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I mean, it
has to be done now.

00:30:15.445 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is the time where
the intervention if there's

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.680 align:middle line:84%
going to be one, has to happen
within the next one to three

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:90%
years maximum.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even less than that.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
I've been reading says,

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:30.560 align:middle line:84%
2030 is their ultimate target
date for this transformation.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And that puts us in
this window right now

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.410 align:middle line:84%
where we have an
opportunity to intervene.

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
that-- these numbers the years

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.968 align:middle line:84%
that I've heard
from all the people

00:30:40.968 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I interview, right, they're
all getting their downloads.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 2026, 2027, and
2030 things are changing.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is
essentially changing.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can only
like bite your fingernails

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and hope that that message meant
we turn the corner together.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And because, again, when
you listen to the technology

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.950 align:middle line:84%
people, they don't talk
in terms of casualties,

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:03.750 align:middle line:90%
but there will be.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.810 align:middle line:84%
This is really the grave
concern, no pun intended.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:09.897 align:middle line:84%
Seriously it's like, OK, this
is deadly serious stuff here.

00:31:09.897 --> 00:31:11.730 align:middle line:84%
We're not just talking
about, oh, maybe this

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:12.630 align:middle line:90%
might not be good.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:90%
This is a war, OK.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.037 align:middle line:84%
This is a war that we're
all involved in here.

00:31:17.037 --> 00:31:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we start to
look at that look at it

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.870 align:middle line:84%
from that perspective,
we gain a lot of clarity.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.787 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go into your
light so you don't need

00:31:22.787 --> 00:31:24.360 align:middle line:90%
to focus on whatever that is.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.100 align:middle line:84%
You need to focus
on what you are.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You use the
example of an acorn.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:29.762 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us that?

00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: This is such
a beautiful analogy

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that the acorn, the tiny seed
that has within its coding

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
a massive oak tree that's
capable of then dropping more

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:84%
acorns, and this process of
cyclical change and growth

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:90%
just perpetuates itself.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we are essentially

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.640 align:middle line:84%
are these acorns that have
been dropped into this world.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Yet we-- yeah, we might be
considered fallen beings,

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
but we fell into this
soil here in order

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:90%
to manifest the oak tree.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And then that oak then becomes
our vehicle of ascension

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.040 align:middle line:90%
into the higher realms.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So if we start to think
about ourselves in that way,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.280 align:middle line:90%
there's--

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As little acorns,
we just need a little sunshine

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.473 align:middle line:84%
Exact-- and a vision
of what is possible.

00:32:12.473 --> 00:32:13.306 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And water.

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Hydrate.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.565 align:middle line:90%
And water.

00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:16.345 align:middle line:84%
And a vision for what
is possible for us.

00:32:16.345 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And that's
what I've always

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:84%
tried to provide for
people in my work.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:84%
The art of living ascension
looking at artwork

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:90%
of these ascended beings.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.983 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to bring that up.

00:32:23.983 --> 00:32:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
things that you really

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.530 align:middle line:84%
prize that raise our
frequencies into more light.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.788 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, apart from what
you think and apart from what

00:32:33.788 --> 00:32:36.272 align:middle line:84%
you put in your mouth, there
are things that you're-- where

00:32:36.272 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:84%
you're directing your
focus and your attention.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.740 align:middle line:84%
That is your ultimate
ultimate tool

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.690 align:middle line:84%
is where are you
putting your intention,

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.340 align:middle line:84%
where are you putting
your attention,

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:90%
what are you feeding?

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is within
control of all of us.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And what many of
us need is a sense

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:90%
of what is possible for me.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't
grow up being taught

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're these
transformational beings that we

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.590 align:middle line:84%
have encoded within our DNA
these wonderful abilities.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we start when we're
five, by the time we're 25,

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:84%
we can start to more
fully awaken them.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.077 align:middle line:84%
But just imagine if
we could do that.

00:33:10.077 --> 00:33:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the predicament
all of us are in.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:15.630 align:middle line:84%
We have an awakening experience,
be it some a health issue,

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:90%
career issue, family whatever.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly now,
we're in it, and we

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:84%
need to know what is possible
and what we can ultimately

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.380 align:middle line:90%
achieve.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we need to
start inculcating that

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.830 align:middle line:90%
into the younger generation--

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --by simple
little joyful practices

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.750 align:middle line:90%
that we can give them.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just even looking
for the most beautiful thing

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.550 align:middle line:90%
they can see in the room.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Or when you're on
a trip, tell us

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
when you see
something beautiful.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.760 align:middle line:90%
You know, shout it out.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But ordering
toward beauty which

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.730 align:middle line:90%
is higher frequency, right.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's music, for
example, if it's artwork.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a thought
or something someone

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:84%
said and starting to instill
in them a kind of a fascination

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.180 align:middle line:84%
with or desire for
these things of beauty,

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:90%
these elements of beauty.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, right.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Just your voice.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so simple.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Watch our voice
and use our voice kindly

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.469 align:middle line:90%
toward others.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Not in a shrill, ugly
shouting kind of way.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And finally, you're
really interested now.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And this just for a
moment, talk about Samson,

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about
you're interested now,

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to start
working with men to start

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:25.449 align:middle line:84%
dealing with any of the
remaining toxic patriarchal

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:27.669 align:middle line:90%
values and vibrations inside.

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, like last year,
I came upon the story of Samson.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd never really heard
it before that an angel,

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.000 align:middle line:84%
a being of light,
came to his mother

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and said you will give
birth to this child

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.498 align:middle line:84%
even though she's
barren and it's Samson.

00:34:39.498 --> 00:34:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Familiar story.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.207 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, leader
of the Israelites.

00:34:42.207 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:84%
He's a Nazarite, and his power
is supposed to be in his hair.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:45.687 align:middle line:90%
And he's a strong man.

00:34:45.687 --> 00:34:47.590 align:middle line:84%
He kills a lion
with his bare hands.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
finding numerous examples

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.949 align:middle line:84%
of that archetype
from Ashurbanipal

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to even Jesus is associated
with the lion, and why is that?

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.590 align:middle line:84%
What is that connection
with lion people.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm giving a talk here
at Gaia on the lion people.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
there's this kind

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:84%
of suppressed, not divine
masculine, but enlightened

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.390 align:middle line:90%
masculine.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:14.437 align:middle line:84%
I mean a white
American male talking--

00:35:14.437 --> 00:35:17.020 align:middle line:84%
people want to talk-- they don't
want to hear from me anymore.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm toxic, right.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But within me is still this
enlightened part of myself,

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:24.127 align:middle line:84%
and it's like I want to
draw that out of myself,

00:35:24.127 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and I want to help other
men to draw it out,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.210 align:middle line:84%
too, because we're being
told to sit down and shut up.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:29.290 align:middle line:90%
That we're the problem.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:90%
And we're not the problem.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.900 align:middle line:90%
We're part of the solution.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have to rise ourselves
in our own frequency

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and tap into these
higher archetypes,

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:84%
be it the Christ
consciousness or Samson.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Some of these-- like
Hercules, Vajrapāṇi,

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.580 align:middle line:84%
the companion of the Buddha
is one of these figures.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole just
treasure trove there waiting

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:84%
to be tapped into
that will, I think,

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.440 align:middle line:84%
really awaken a different
kind of masculinity.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.977 align:middle line:84%
But as always,
there's the pendulum.

00:35:59.977 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And the oppressed usually have
to have their say in their day.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: For sure.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so here we are.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.340 align:middle line:84%
The white men have been ruling
the joint for a long time.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Globally.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now the others,
all of the rest of us women,

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.490 align:middle line:84%
all the people with
lower serotonin rates,

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:16.640 align:middle line:90%
let's just say that--

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --oftentimes
can overreact.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.225 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, that's
natural in the pendulum swing.

00:36:22.225 --> 00:36:23.025 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Totally.

00:36:23.025 --> 00:36:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we've got to
give ourselves patience

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.020 align:middle line:90%
and compassion and grace.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let people
have their say,

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:90%
let it go further the other way.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if you're one of
the people who can stay sane

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:84%
during all of this and have
true grace and compassion,

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
then we can look at the beauty
that's in these white males

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.020 align:middle line:90%
still--

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.940 align:middle line:84%
that still have
something to contribute,

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're not all
condemned to go to hell.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, right, right.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think it's
very important to acknowledge

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.255 align:middle line:84%
the-- acknowledge that journey
that women and people of color

00:36:57.255 --> 00:36:58.055 align:middle line:90%
have had to take--

00:36:58.055 --> 00:36:59.097 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Without a doubt.

00:36:59.097 --> 00:37:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --alongside
not just trashing

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.540 align:middle line:84%
all the men of the planet
because they don't all

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:90%
deserve it.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:03.913 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:37:03.913 --> 00:37:06.590 align:middle line:10%
And a corollary
for me to that is

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.390 align:middle line:10%
the rise of the interest
in Mary Magdalene.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: A resurgence of that.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.460 align:middle line:10%
I was writing about
Mary Magdalene

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.455 align:middle line:10%
20 years ago with Sir Laurence
Gardner, and looking at it now,

00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:18.080 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden, it's
come back around,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.190 align:middle line:10%
and it's so exciting because
I see her, Magdalene,

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.590 align:middle line:10%
as a true like beacon.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:27.335 align:middle line:90%
As a true awakening force.

00:37:27.335 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
Templars were devoted

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to her, many were
devoted to Mary Magdalene

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.810 align:middle line:90%
more so than Jesus Christ.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Well yeah, and I've
always thought of Jesus

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.090 align:middle line:90%
as her daredevil test pilot.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: So--

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.623 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of-- yeah
they were well matched.

00:37:40.623 --> 00:37:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well matched.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's interesting,
and maybe some other time,

00:37:45.013 --> 00:37:48.290 align:middle line:84%
we'll also talk about some
of what you and Sir Laurence

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:49.805 align:middle line:90%
Gardner were up to in the day.

00:37:49.805 --> 00:37:51.180 align:middle line:90%
He was such a wonderful man.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, he was.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I only, I had
dinner with him once.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful man.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I really miss him.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So we'll find out what
that was all about

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.370 align:middle line:84%
because I think he had access
to documents and vaults

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: He definitely did.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Houses.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Manor houses in England
that are stuffed with stuff.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll have another
conversation another day.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.330 align:middle line:84%
William, it's always an absolute
pleasure talking with you.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Thank you so much.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So wonderful,
so inspiring,

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.912 align:middle line:84%
fun, scary, all
at the same time.

00:38:12.912 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, right, right.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Thanks for holding
our hand through all this.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
The title of the
book is "Ascension:

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Divine Stories of Awakening the
Whole and Holy Being Within."
