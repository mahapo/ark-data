00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Dr. Edward
Group is with us once again,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:10%
always pushing the envelope to
support the most optimal health

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:10%
we can possibly achieve.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:10%
Today we're going to
be talking about what

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:10%
all the fasting trends
are about and how

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:10%
to engage in a way
that is safe for us

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:10%
individually because
we're all different.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.998 align:middle line:84%
Plus he's created a new form
of a raw herbal extract,

00:00:52.998 --> 00:00:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
be among the first

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
to hear about this because this
is a whole new thing out there.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
first of all, welcome.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen you
in a few years.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:84%
I think last time I interviewed
you, was it in Austin

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.760 align:middle line:90%
or was it here?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD GROUP: I
think it was here here.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.313 align:middle line:84%
And then at a conference
I see you here and there,

00:01:09.313 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
but you were-- when I talked
to you years ago you were just

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:84%
starting to work on this
amazing tincture that--

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:84%
you were just starting to
get your mind around it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
in the research and
how to craft it.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to talk about that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:90%
toward the end of the show.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Turn people on to something new.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Sounds good.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But first,
let's talk about fasting.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
ketogenics and kind

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
of kick starting
the immune system.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
do you do ketogenics

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
when you're a vegan, and
all these different topics.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.532 align:middle line:84%
And start getting
into it because I

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:84%
think we're seeing kind
of an overall breakdown

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
in immune systems
across the board.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of chronic illness in
all ages now, and that's--

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
that's your specialty
is how to reverse that.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:10%
>>GROUP: Yeah, it's--

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:10%
I try to do everything in
simplicity as you know,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.820 align:middle line:10%
and it all starts with looking
at the current situation

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.620 align:middle line:10%
that we're in.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we have more
disease than ever before,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:10%
we have people suffering
from mental disorders,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:10%
we have people suffering
from diabetes, heart disease,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:10%
self-esteem problems,
depression, anxiety--

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:10%
the list goes on, and
on, and on, and on.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You almost never meet
just a happy, healthy person

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: It's very rare.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:90%
It's very rare.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And astonishingly, I was
just traveling through Europe

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and it used to be
you go to Europe

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and you see people that
are very fit over there.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And now the same thing is
happening in all countries

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, are you noticing
that in the obesity trends

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:90%
in Europe?

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, I first started
noticing it in England

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.007 align:middle line:84%
where when I first started
traveling to England

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:90%
you didn't see much.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:84%
People walked a lot and
took public transit.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But whatever is going
on now with the diet

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and-- and the drugs,
I mean, I don't mean--

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean prescription drugs,
anti-depressants and so forth.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Massive obesity rates
in England now just

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
like the United States,
just like Australia,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.045 align:middle line:90%
and what are you seeing?

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:84%
What did you see in
the rest of Europe?

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:10%
>>GROUP: I'm seeing
the same thing,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:10%
and they're reporting the same
things that have been happening

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:10%
here and in different parts
of the world for a long period

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:10%
of time, but the
difference between what

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:10%
I do and the research
that we all do here

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:10%
is we look at what is the
root cause of these health

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:10%
problems instead of
looking at the symptoms

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:10%
and treating the symptoms like
the medical community will do.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.880 align:middle line:84%
The good news is more and more
doctors are getting on board,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and the good news
is more individuals

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
are getting educated by
watching shows like this,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
by going online and actually
seeing and experiencing

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
their parents dying or
their parents being ill.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So this next generation
is a little bit more

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
educated as far as
natural health goes.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
But how I got into
fasting was I'm

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:84%
always looking for the
simplicity in healing the body,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
because I believe we all
have a self-healing mechanism

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
within us that God has given
us that we have the ability

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
to heal any disease or any
condition that we have.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what we
determined in our research

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago when
our research team was

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
hired to come and find different
types of natural medicine.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:84%
When the big cancer hospitals
were putting in the CAM

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
programs-- the complementary
alternative medicine programs--

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:84%
they contracted us to go out,
and talk to all the cancer

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
doctors, and find out
what they were doing,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and find out what works
that they could bring in.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
What we found by
talking to everybody

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:84%
is that there's no need
for people to suffer

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:90%
from any type of illness.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.140 align:middle line:84%
The most successful
doctors out there believe

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
that we all have a
self-healing mechanism,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to address
the root cause of the illness.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we address the
root cause of the illness,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
the body will then
activate and heal itself.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And the mind and the soul
will merge together as one.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
That's why I got into
detoxification and cleansing

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's an easier way
to reactivate the body's

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
self-healing mechanism by
starting with cleansing

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and healing the gut, which
is the number one organ

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.928 align:middle line:90%
system that causes disease.

00:05:11.928 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Because all of the
chemicals, all the

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.215 align:middle line:84%
toxins that we consume enter
through the gut lining.

00:05:17.215 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: A majority, anyway.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, years
and years ago, I

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
was-- when I first started
doing alternative medicine

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:84%
coverage in media I thought, OK,
I'm going to take a cameraman,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
go to Europe and do
this thing on my own,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll present
it to someone.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:90%
It actually got pretty far.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And what it was was
looking at energy

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
medicine of all kinds, color
therapy and such in Europe.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And I put this great little
series together of reports

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and I remember this one
doctor, Dr. Wolfgang Ludwig,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
who is just this amazing
wild physicist who

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:84%
understood the nature of
health on an atomic level.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you
don't understand,

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:90%
it is all in the guts.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.132 align:middle line:84%
Everything, all illness,
it's all in the guts.

00:05:59.132 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
time I'd heard that.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.010 align:middle line:90%
This was in the '80s, right?

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
People weren't
talking about it then.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:90%
You were a little kid.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I-- it stuck with me,
and I start thinking that

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:90%
through the years.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And about time I
met you and others

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
it's like, oh my God,
it's all in the guts

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and what we throw in there.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, what
separated the doctors--

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
the doctors that we analyzed and
that we looked at their studies

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that they have done and looked
at their patient success rates,

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
they were all doing
similar things.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:84%
What they were doing was
they were spending time

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:90%
with the patient, number one--

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
asking the patient
questions, spending

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.962 align:middle line:84%
more than seven minutes with
the patient, which now doctors

00:06:40.962 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
are spending seven
or eight minutes

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and writing a
prescription medication.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
going to their house,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:90%
evaluating their environment.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times that's what
we did when we had our cancer

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.940 align:middle line:84%
clinic before it
got shut down is

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
we would-- you have to
understand the individual

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and understand what's
creating that toxicity

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:90%
with the individual.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is not only
what's inside the individual--

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
environment, yeah.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.012 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: But what's
outside the individual.

00:07:10.012 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we went
into homes with that

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.090 align:middle line:84%
had black mold all
over the ceilings,

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:84%
we went into homes that
were just completely toxic

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
with toxic cleaning
products, toxic food.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of the different
things that contribute

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:90%
to somebody's toxic load.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
want to say what's

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
the root cause of all
disease and illness,

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
it's nothing more
than a toxic load.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
If your body can only
process and eliminate

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
a million chemicals and
toxins on a daily basis

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:84%
but you're bringing in three,
or four, or five million

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis, then all
of those chemicals and toxins

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:84%
start congesting the liver,
start ruining the gut,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
start leaking through,
and then that's

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
how the whole disease
process ends up starting.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we know now that
there is a simple system

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:90%
that you can use.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Cleanse and heal the gut,
cleanse and heal the liver,

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
eliminate all the harmful
organisms from the body

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:84%
because what we're
seeing now is just

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
everybody has an accumulation of
fungus, mold, bacteria, virus,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:84%
worms because of these
chemicals, and these toxins,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and these bad foods that
are creating an imbalance

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:90%
of the body's natural pH.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
That we're inviting all of
these organisms into our system

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:90%
and they're living inside of us.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So cleansing all of those
out and then cleansing

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:84%
all the chemicals and toxic
metals out is the last stage.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And many doctors have found
this secret over the years

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
to utilize this one system of
detoxification and cleansing.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And when they do that, the
body's self-healing mechanism

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.805 align:middle line:84%
can then become reactivated
and the body can heal itself.

00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well, OK.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.662 align:middle line:84%
And so some of that takes some
real dedication and people

00:08:54.662 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:84%
have a difficult time
sometimes, so we're

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.607 align:middle line:90%
going to break it down.

00:08:57.607 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go through the
different kinds of fasting

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and first of all, let's
start with the whole notion

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:90%
of ketogenics.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And now a lot of people do--

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
their ketogenic diet really
consists of just super low

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:90%
to no carbs, right?

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Right.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I guess
starving off lactic acid

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:84%
in the cancer cells,
and that is one approach

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.990 align:middle line:90%
that seems to be working.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But again, then you have
people with different dietary

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.720 align:middle line:84%
With ketogenic a lot of times
it's fats, it's animal protein,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's lots of
vegetables, as well.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, how would, for example,
a vegan use a ketogenic diet

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.230 align:middle line:90%
or structure a ketogenic diet?

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, going back to
how the ketogenic diet was even

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
before under the history,
it really dates back--

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and this was the research
that I had spent myself

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and a research scientist
for the last two years

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
trying to dig back and find
the history behind what's

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:90%
really going on.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And that leads us to
fasting, and fasting--

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:90%
water-only fasting.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I call it hardcore fasting
because there is nothing

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that I've found in
the last 25 years that

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
will heal the body faster
than water-only fasting.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Do I think everybody
needs to do it?

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't think
everybody needs to do it,

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
but tracing the history
of water-only fasting

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
it goes back thousands
and thousands of years.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this the beginning
of the ketogenic story?

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: This is the beginning
of the ketogenic story

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.985 align:middle line:84%
because that's how you
get in a ketogenic state.

00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:90%
There's two different ways.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.760 align:middle line:84%
You can do it through fasting or
you can do it through dietary.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But the original
form of ketogenic

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:90%
is through water-only fasting.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
did that originate?

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Where did that--

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well that,
you know, we--

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.902 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would think the
indigenous species knew it.

00:10:39.902 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: In the religious
texts like in the Bible

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:90%
they talk about 40 day fast.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:84%
In the Quran they talk about
fasting, they still do that.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.810 align:middle line:84%
If you look back at
the ancient Vedic--

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic technology,
they talk about fasting.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
a lot of medicine,

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't-- they only had
what God gave them or what they

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:90%
had in nature to heal the body.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
healing process was

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.110 align:middle line:90%
going into a ketogenic state.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And how that happens
is they would just

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:84%
have water, sunlight, and
rest the majority of times.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Just like the ancient
physicians noticed

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
that when an animal
became injured,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:84%
the animal would lay
there and do what's called

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:84%
a dry fast where that's
no water or food.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And the body-- the animal's body
would heal itself very rapidly.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.147 align:middle line:84%
And the animal's body would
go into a ketogenic state.

00:11:33.147 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
what's happening in a minute.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.022 align:middle line:84%
Finish this part,
and what's actually

00:11:37.022 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:90%
happening in a ketogenic state.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Right,
so what happens is

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
if you're talking about
water-only fasting.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the fastest way to
get into a ketogenic state,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's the fastest
repair mechanism.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like, we can talk
about the fastest and the most

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
effective form of healing
on the body ketogenic,

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and then we can move
into the difference

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:84%
between this rapid
type of healing

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.670 align:middle line:84%
which induces stem cell
production and autophagy where

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:84%
the body actually starts
attacking any abnormal or dead

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:90%
tissues in the system.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:84%
None of that is going
to actually happen

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:90%
in a feeding ketogenic state.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually
different phases

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:84%
of being in ketogenic depending
on what you want to use it for.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
You have the superb
healing ability

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:84%
of water-only fasting
ketogenic state,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
then you have the
dietary ketogenic state,

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
the variations of all

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:90%
the different ketogenic states.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But in general,
ketogenic state means

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
you've burned up
all of your glucose

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:84%
because you've gotten
rid of all of the sugars

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that you're ingesting or all
the carbohydrates that you're

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:90%
ingesting.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And you've gone
onto a diet which

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:84%
consists of mostly
fats or mostly high

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
proteins that are
not going to give you

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:90%
high amounts of glucose.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So the liver, when the
liver runs out of glucose

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
through gluconeogenesis, it then
shifts into a state of ketosis.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
When you shift into
a state of ketosis,

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
your body starts relying
on ketones for fuel.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
your body also

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:84%
starts burning fat for fuel
instead of sugars for fuel.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:90%
So that can be very effective.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:84%
What's happened, in my
opinion, over the last--

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:84%
probably just the
last five years

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is that everybody
wants to come out

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
with some sort of
a ketogenic diet,

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and I always look
back at nature.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Why was this used,
how should it be used,

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and what is going to be the most
effective use of somebody that

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.077 align:middle line:84%
wants to go into
a ketogenic diet?

00:13:45.077 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Should they do it for
a long period of time?

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Should they not do it for
a long period of time,

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and what's the best
one for them to use?

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, one thing I've
seen repeatedly is the people

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
that take it on seriously--

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
they're not looking for
ways to kind of cheat,

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, just straight up
fats, proteins, and greens--

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:90%
green vegetables.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I do see what happens with
them, and it is pretty stunning

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:90%
even when they're eating food.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And I can't imagine
how much more stunning

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
the results are when
you go with just water.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just that people
have such an attachment

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to the notion of
food, and also there

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
is-- you do pay a little
price along the way.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into a
ketogenic state even with food--

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:90%
because I've gone on some of--

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:84%
an all green diet for a
little while just to cleanse,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and there is a period of time
where your mind is just edgy

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and things don't
feel right at all.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
those various stages

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:84%
of what you have to pass through
in order to get into that.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I noticed, they
all lost a lot of weight.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.753 align:middle line:84%
Their pains and aches
and their bodies

00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
went away, so must be
the necrotic tissue

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:84%
was by this time excreted
or whatnot, right?

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And their immune systems
seemed to be pretty intact.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, water-only
fasting and then ketogenics

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
were not used on a continuous
basis ever in the past before.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And now we don't really know
what the long term results are

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:84%
going to be because
this is a trendy fad

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many different
diets that are out there.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I really like
intermittent fasting,

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
using intermittent fasting
with a ketogenic diet.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But then if you're
looking at-- there's

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
just not enough
research out on it.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Most people that are
using ketogenic diets

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:90%
are using it for weight loss.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.035 align:middle line:84%
Because the body switches
to burn fat for fuel.

00:15:32.035 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
still you're having

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.010 align:middle line:84%
high amounts of fat and
high amounts of protein.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, we
don't know how the body

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.558 align:middle line:90%
handles that long term.

00:15:40.558 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well again,
you know, you're

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:84%
taking out some of
the nutrients that

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:84%
can be extremely beneficial
for people like fruits.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And fruits are going
to contain fiber, oxygen,

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:84%
minerals, lots of
fresh water in fruits.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the jury
is still out on what's

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:90%
the best ketogenic diet.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you look at
a vegan ketogenic diet,

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:90%
let's say, what are you eating?

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:84%
You're eating olives,
you're eating avocado,

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:84%
you're eating different
types of oils,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
you're eating very low
carbohydrate vegetables,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:90%
lettuces, stuff like that.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
You're eating nuts, and
seeds, and basically water.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
You you're still,
I think, missing

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
some really good
nutrients, and we

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.990 align:middle line:90%
don't know how all of those--

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:84%
specifically on a
vegan ketogenic diet

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:39.520 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how all of those
results are going to turn out

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and how the body's
going to sustain

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.707 align:middle line:90%
that over a period of time.

00:16:42.707 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, I guess
the reality is if you're, say,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:84%
on a vegan ketogenic diet and
you choose to do it on a longer

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
term you can certainly add
in things like what is it--

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Juice Plus all the kind of
enzymes and some of the things

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that you're fully aware of to
add that some of the nutrients

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and the enzyme from fruits back
into the diet via supplements.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same, it's
not exactly the same,

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
but you can add some
of it back in, right?

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.043 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Yeah, I think the
best from all the people

00:17:12.043 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that I've talked to and
the research I've done

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.165 align:middle line:84%
is that never to really
be on something too long,

00:17:18.165 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Because even
seasonally in nature,

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
let's say if a family
is still living

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:84%
on a farm they're
going to be growing

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:90%
their vegetables in the spring.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.147 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be grilling
a different set of vegetables

00:17:30.147 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:90%
in the fall or whatever.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be cycling
through different types

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:90%
of foods.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I wish there was
some answer to where

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.510 align:middle line:84%
there's one diet or there's
one special thing that

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
worked for everybody,
but I mean,

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:84%
you really have
to know your body.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
You really have to understand
what works with your body.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I do think, however, that
fasting can be incorporated in

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:56.803 align:middle line:84%
and intermittent
fast is really--

00:17:56.803 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In any diet, yeah.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.428 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --is really
something that

00:17:59.428 --> 00:18:03.970 align:middle line:84%
can be utilized for
any diet that you have.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And the research
is actually showing

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.515 align:middle line:84%
how beneficial
intermittent fasting is.

00:18:07.515 --> 00:18:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we're going to
go to intermittent in a moment.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's get back to water.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how long that
lasts, and the type of water,

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and the phases people can expect
to go through because it's not

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:90%
always comfortable.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, the
first thing when

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:84%
you talk about water-only
fasting probably

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.840 align:middle line:84%
the number one benefit
from water-only fasting

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.380 align:middle line:84%
is you shut down the
digestive system.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And this doesn't happen.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Water-only fasting is
abstinence from food completely.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:84%
That means not even
a grain of salt,

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:84%
not even a grain
of pepper, nothing

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.230 align:middle line:90%
but pure distilled water.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
If you can get spring water
pure that's not contaminated,

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
the groundwater source,
then you can use that.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:90%
But pure distilled water.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing that
happens with water-only fasting

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is around 72 hours or
around the fourth day

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
your body goes into what's
called an autophagy phase.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And the autophagy phase kicks
in because your digestive system

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:90%
stops.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
This is very amazing
what happens in the body

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
because researchers have found
that just one meal a day--

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is another reason why
intermittent fasting works so

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:84%
good-- they found
that one meal a day

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:29.080 align:middle line:84%
can utilize up to 75% to
80% of your energy stores

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:90%
that you have every single day.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:90%
So think about that.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:84%
You have people that are
eating one, two, three,

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
four meals a day,
snacking, but they only

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
have enough energy in their body
to break down one meal a day.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.925 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
people are eating

00:19:43.925 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
the wrong types of foods,
they're eating processed foods,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:84%
they're not able to chew their
food long enough until it's

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:90%
a liquid.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Their enzymes are becoming
low in their pancreas.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Their food is sitting in
their system for 72 hours.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not digesting.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
The proteins are
turning putrefactic,

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:84%
the carbohydrates
are fermenting,

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.642 align:middle line:84%
the fats are turning
rancid in their system,

00:20:05.642 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and then they push another
meal right on top of that,

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and they just keep pushing
another meal on top of that.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So the fascinating thing that
happens with water-only fasting

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
around the fourth day mark
is when the digestive system

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.820 align:middle line:84%
completely stops
the body says, wait

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.070 align:middle line:90%
a second, what's going on here?

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Like all of my energy--

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:84%
the 100% of my energy
that I'm now being--

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that I've used for the past 20,
30, 40 years to break down--

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
because the digestive
tract is huge--

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and to digest all of this,
and to get the liver working,

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and to maximize the
absorption of everything,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and to bring these nutrients to
the proper organs is all gone.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So fasting is a rest period,
but it's a very intense healing

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:90%
process for the body.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Because then when that
shifts and the body

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
goes into autophagy,
the body starts focusing

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:90%
100% of its energy on healing.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And a study by USC about
a year ago came out

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and said that 72 hours
of water-only fasting

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
produced immune stem
cells and regenerated

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.710 align:middle line:90%
the entire immune system.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, you and I have been in
this field for a long time

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and I can honestly
say that I have never

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:84%
found anything that can
regenerate an immune system

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and create immune stem
cells in 72 hours.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
pretty phenomenal.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So people say,
well, what is autophagy?

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is
this autophagy thing

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that happens after
around the fourth day

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:90%
of water-only fasting?

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It's when the body
searches and destroys

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
any abnormal cells,
any abnormal tissue,

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:84%
anything that's not functioning
at 100% inside the body.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And the body knows
intuitively where to focus.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's say PCOS in
women, polycystic ovarian,

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:90%
fibrocystic, cancer.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They've even done studies
on Parkinson's disease

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and had women that go
through a 21 day water-only

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:84%
fast for Parkinson's disease
and completely eliminate

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:90%
all the tremors.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And within one year's time
the Parkinson's disease

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:90%
was completely gone.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes-- it doesn't
matter what it

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:90%
is that you're suffering from.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the simplicity
of everything, right?

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like are you really
saying that for $1.99 a day

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.220 align:middle line:84%
that you can-- the body can
eliminate any disease known

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:84%
to man except for genetic
diseases like Down syndrome,

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:90%
but any acquired condition?

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, yes, it
is possible to do that.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
That will not happen
on a juice fast,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.350 align:middle line:84%
that will not happen on any
type of ketogenic, that will not

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
happen on anything else because
the digestive system is still

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
one thing that's

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:84%
just striking me is
that oftentimes when

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the studies
that come out on health

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and nutrition, those
studies are often

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at who
sponsored the study because you

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
have to look at who
stands to benefit from it.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.840 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting about
this is if you're just talking

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.805 align:middle line:84%
distilled water,
it's interesting they

00:23:20.805 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:84%
took this study on
it all because there

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have been any really
big money behind it, right?

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Right.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:84%
University of Chicago has
been doing studies on fasting.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:90%
They did a study--

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:84%
they took a 40-year-old
unhealthy guy

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
who was stressed out, they
put him on a 14 day water-only

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:84%
When he was done
with the fast, they

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:84%
redid all of his
physiological testing, all

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of his biological testing,
and they found that in 14 days

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.840 align:middle line:84%
he had the physiological
body of a 20-year-old.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
He reversed his age by
20 years in 14 days.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
The world record for fasting was
382 days from a guy in Scotland

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:90%
that was medically supervised.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:84%
He was 480 something pounds
when he went into it.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, he did not do the full
382 days on water only.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:84%
He had some potassium
supplements, some--

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:84%
no food, by the way, just
water and a few supplements.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.530 align:middle line:84%
He had some yeast a few
times during that fast.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:90%
But he went from--

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
he had all different
kinds of conditions.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:84%
He went from 400
and something pounds

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
down to 180 pounds in 382
days, and maintained that

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.190 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So fasting was really
big in the 1900s.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.010 align:middle line:10%
There was a guy named Arnold
Ehret who was promoting fasting

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:10%
and saw over 40,000 patients
medically supervised fasting.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:84%
However, most of his
research was burned.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Most of the books were
taken up, most of the stuff

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.215 align:middle line:84%
is hard to find because
when the American Medical

00:25:00.215 --> 00:25:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Association came in and
the pharmaceuticals--

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The usual story.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --they closed
down all the spas.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.583 align:middle line:84%
I mean, remember all the mineral
springs that were everywhere?

00:25:07.583 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:84%
When people needed to get
healed, what did they do?

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:84%
They went to a mineral spring,
they drank water for 10 days,

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.845 align:middle line:84%
they fasted, they got
healed, they went home.

00:25:15.845 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
sat in the waters.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So healing doesn't
have to be expensive.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Healing doesn't have to be hard.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
We have everything that
we need to heal the body.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And nobody believed what he
was saying in his results

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:90%
back then--

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Arnold Ehret in the 1900s.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:10%
So he literally locked
himself in a glass chamber

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:10%
with a notary public
and two physicians

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:10%
watching him for 49 days--

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.890 align:middle line:10%
days and nights-- and
had nothing but water.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
To show people
that, again, we've

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
been conditioned to believe
that we have to eat.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hope he had
some good books to read.

00:25:56.975 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yeah, right?

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.465 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- but also fasting is a
spiritual progression, as well.

00:26:00.465 --> 00:26:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
right, and we'll

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:90%
talk about that in a moment.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So anyway,
just to prove to society

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and to prove to the
medical physicians

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
back then that fasting is not
dangerous, although there's

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:84%
been a huge campaigns
from the 1940s,

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
1950s on from the
big agriculture,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
from the big food industry,
from the pharmaceutical industry

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that all work together
that we need to eat more,

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:84%
we need to have breakfast,
we need to have snacks,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
we need to have wine, we need
to eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now we see the
evidence of what that brings,

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:32.970 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And his main quote
was we are eating way more

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:90%
than what the body can handle.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back to
the digestive system.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
the root cause of disease,

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.700 align:middle line:84%
it's really you talk a
lot about the energetics.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.770 align:middle line:84%
When you break everything
down, it's all into the energy.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:84%
It is the energy
of the food, it's

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:84%
how much energy your
body has to heal,

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:84%
it's how much energy that
we're absorbing from the sun

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.890 align:middle line:90%
or from the environment.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And now we have people
slathering sunscreen

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.310 align:middle line:84%
all over their skin and
staying away from the sun,

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:84%
the one thing that can heal
you with water, and rest,

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.893 align:middle line:90%
and being in nature.

00:27:06.893 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, to say nothing
of Harvard's new experiment

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:12.730 align:middle line:84%
to try to dim the sun
through weather modification.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Don't even-- yeah,
let's not go there.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:84%
In any event, so you've gone
through the physical part

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:84%
of it, and even as
little as 72 hours really

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.887 align:middle line:90%
kicks this process in.

00:27:22.887 --> 00:27:24.720 align:middle line:84%
You're creating new
stem cells and so forth,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and your body's eating
the necrotic tissue,

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and you should feel
like a million bucks.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, your mind might
feel a little kind of dim

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
along the way, but then
it starts clarifying.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yes.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So what happens the first
few days when you're--

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
especially when you're
water-only fasting,

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and the same thing
happens with ketogenic,

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:84%
is you might get dizzy a little
bit, you might feel weak,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.225 align:middle line:90%
you might have a headache.

00:27:46.225 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, those are just
some of the symptoms

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:84%
that you might have
some muscle aches.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Usually around the
72 hour mark is

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.180 align:middle line:84%
when your glucose
starts running down

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and your body is
making that switch.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.940 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the hardest
part for people to go through

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:84%
because they think
that something

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:90%
is going wrong in their body.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:84%
They think that-- they
feel it in their stomach.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.518 align:middle line:90%
They feel dizzy.

00:28:11.518 --> 00:28:13.310 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they
might have to pass out,

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of
a scary feeling.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:84%
They start feeling
a little anxiety,

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
they start feeling a
little bit of fear.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, that
feeling usually

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.940 align:middle line:90%
only lasts for about an hour.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.495 align:middle line:84%
You usually have a hour
window where you're really--

00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Making that
transition, yeah.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.662 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: One to two
hour window where

00:28:28.662 --> 00:28:30.470 align:middle line:84%
you're making that
transition, and that's

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.870 align:middle line:84%
where people get scared in
that one to two hour window

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and they end up
eating something.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
If you can just sit down and
relax or lay down and let

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.810 align:middle line:84%
it pass, usually at the
end of that two hours

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
whenever those ketones start
coming in to your blood then

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.860 align:middle line:84%
you'll actually start
feeling more energy.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:52.153 align:middle line:84%
So with water-only fasting,
with going into ketogenic,

00:28:52.153 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:84%
usually people will tell
you the first three or four

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.903 align:middle line:90%
days are always the hardest.

00:28:55.903 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, your
body gets used to it,

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and you start having more
energy, and more energy,

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.400 align:middle line:90%
and more energy.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:10%
When I did my 18 day water
only fast, from day four

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.030 align:middle line:10%
to probably like day
16 or so I didn't

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:10%
feel like I was hungry at all.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like
I needed food.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I should have
done is not been so active.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.227 align:middle line:90%
That I learned not to be active.

00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Because again, if
you're active you're

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.812 align:middle line:84%
utilizing your body's energy
and you're taking it away--

00:29:26.812 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From the
healing process, yeah.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --from it being
able to heal your body.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
spiritual component of it

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
because fasting has been
used for spiritual purposes

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.950 align:middle line:90%
historically, right?

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Through various
religions, and practices.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous cultures
use it as well.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when
the body is freed itself

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:50.060 align:middle line:84%
from all this toil of
digestion and elimination

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.410 align:middle line:90%
on more of a spiritual level?

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: You
start-- it's amazing

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:84%
what happens is when you
take food completely out

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.350 align:middle line:84%
of your life and
you're just living

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.890 align:middle line:84%
on water, first
thing you realize

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.400 align:middle line:84%
is how much of your
time and your life,

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:90%
it revolves around food.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of this
ah-ha moment that you

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
go through when you're not
thinking about what you're

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:84%
going to cook or eat for
breakfast, where you're going

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to go or what you're
going to eat for lunch,

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:84%
what you're going
to prepare if you

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.690 align:middle line:90%
need to go grocery shopping.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a massive amount
of time in our lives

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.800 align:middle line:90%
that revolve around food.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So how does that work into
the spiritual component of it?

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you don't have all
of these thoughts about work

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and food, and you're
focused on your body,

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and your body's in
a ketogenic state,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a
state of rest, it

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:84%
allows you the time to start
asking questions out of boredom

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:84%
maybe if you're
just sitting there

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of who am I. But
your body is going

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.060 align:middle line:84%
through this
transformational phase too,

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.040 align:middle line:90%
so it almost forces you.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:02.840 align:middle line:90%
You start--

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
this dizzying phase.

00:31:04.548 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: It forces you to--

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.120 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of hard
to explain, but it

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:84%
forces you to almost go within,
and start learning more,

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.045 align:middle line:84%
and start understanding about
your life more and what's

00:31:17.045 --> 00:31:18.670 align:middle line:84%
some of the things
that you were doing.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.920 align:middle line:84%
In like forgiveness
comes up and emotions.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
When the liver starts
to become cleansed

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.970 align:middle line:84%
when you're fasting, just like
traditional Chinese medicine,

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:90%
emotions start to evolve.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of these--
negativity this negativity

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:84%
or these negative
emotions that you store--

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:84%
the anger, the fear, the guilt,
the resentment, the jealousy,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:90%
and the lack of forgiveness.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.443 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say on
the fourth or fifth day

00:31:44.443 --> 00:31:46.860 align:middle line:84%
they'll just start crying and
all these emotions will just

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.510 align:middle line:90%
start pouring out.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So fasting is a
cleansing, and that's

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.170 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual component
that comes to it as well.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
fasting stories

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:02.370 align:middle line:84%
was by a guy named Dr. Corrales,
and this was in the 1970s.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:84%
On the 17th day
of his water-only

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
fast, it was about 2 o'clock
in the morning, and he woke up,

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and he had so much energy that
he felt like going for a run.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, he knew that
you're not really

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.810 align:middle line:84%
supposed to go do any
physical activity,

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and he tried to
go back to sleep.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.975 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't
go back to sleep,

00:32:21.975 --> 00:32:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't
go back to sleep.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And then he just had this
internal desire to just go run,

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.050 align:middle line:90%
to go run.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:84%
He just kind of kept trying to
suppress it and suppress it.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Finally it just came to him,
it was almost like a vision.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And he got up out of
bed and he went running.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And he ran for four
hours straight.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said that at
the end of his run

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:53.290 align:middle line:84%
he started seeing colors,
and he started becoming one

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
with nature, and
he started having

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.860 align:middle line:84%
this incredible spiritual
experience of love.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Like he could literally feel the
love resonating from the trees.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Like the trees were
talking to him.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:09.040 align:middle line:84%
He could feel the
particles in the air.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said by that time the
sun was starting to come up

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and he was walking
and walking after--

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and he was in such
a state of peace

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that he said he's never
experienced anything like it.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.520 align:middle line:90%
It was a sense of happiness.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And he described it as when your
soul, and your physical body,

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:90%
and your mind merge together.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said he
wishes that everybody

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.350 align:middle line:84%
would be able to experience that
experience that he experienced

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:90%
in his life.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a spiritual
transformation

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that happened to where
everything became one.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Like we were all connected.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And he could see and he
could feel the vibrations,

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:84%
he could see the colors,
he could see the auras.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:84%
He could feel-- he could hear
the sounds and the melodies

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that were-- that people can't
hear because we're so blocked,

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.465 align:middle line:84%
and our pineal gland is so
calcified because the fluoride,

00:34:02.465 --> 00:34:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and the chlorine,
and all the chemicals

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.070 align:middle line:84%
that we have inside
of our system.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.719 align:middle line:84%
So as those layers
start folding back

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and as we start cleansing the
body more, and more, and more--

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and water-only fasting would be
the most rapid way to do that,

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.110 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have
that balance between--

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:24.190 align:middle line:84%
or that perfect what
we're here for initially,

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.639 align:middle line:84%
that perfect balance between
the mind, body, and soul

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
is what he
experienced with that.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And everybody experiences
something different.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.639 align:middle line:84%
Usually anybody who fasts for,
let's say, eight days, nine

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:84%
days or longer usually has
some form of emotional cleanse

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:42.070 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:45.739 align:middle line:84%
They're using water-only
fasting now for depression,

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:50.860 align:middle line:84%
for anxiety, for mental
illness, which is usually

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.010 align:middle line:84%
brought on by the toxicity,
by the electromagnetic

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.620 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, by all the
chemicals, and the metals,

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and all the things that
are going into the brain

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.310 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, you know, addressing the
root cause of all those things

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.280 align:middle line:84%
is what people
should be focused on

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and what we're here
to teach people.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, here's the cause,
here's some of the things

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that you can do to
regenerate or to live

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that healthy, happy life that
is really all of our desire.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a very,
very powerful story--

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.268 align:middle line:84%
the story of water
fasting, and thank you

00:35:26.268 --> 00:35:27.740 align:middle line:90%
for sharing that with us.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And now let's look at
intermittent fasting

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:84%
because that's something people
bite off in tiny little chunks

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and start playing
with the notion

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.170 align:middle line:90%
of not eating every few hours.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yeah.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a great
transition because I

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.070 align:middle line:84%
am a big fan of
intermittent fasting,

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and it all goes back to the
story about the digestion.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you know that 70%
to 80% of your energy

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:84%
is going to be consumed
with three meals--

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:90%
with one meal a day--

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Digesting food, yeah.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --then we are
eating way, way too much.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.080 align:middle line:90%
People are eating way too much.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So this way you can still
eat and you can still

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.760 align:middle line:84%
eat a good plant-based
organic diet,

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.610 align:middle line:84%
avoid all the
chemicals and toxins.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And intermittent
fasting is something

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.540 align:middle line:90%
that you can transition into.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:84%
You can start by just
skipping one meal a day.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Just pick one meal a day
that you want to skip.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Skip breakfast.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And that means going to
bed at let's say 9 o'clock

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and then your next
meal is going to be--

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lunch.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: --at lunch.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And some people
transitioning into that

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:34.840 align:middle line:84%
might feel that, oh you know,
I really like eating breakfast,

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.145 align:middle line:90%
but I usually skip lunch anyway.

00:36:37.145 --> 00:36:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
skip my lunch meal

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:90%
and then go into my dinner meal.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.193 align:middle line:90%
You can work your way up.

00:36:44.193 --> 00:36:45.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can
work your way up

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:49.030 align:middle line:84%
till a general really
good intermittent fast

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:53.170 align:middle line:84%
would be 16 to 18 hours a
day where you're not eating.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
that I talk to

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:59.710 align:middle line:84%
will eat their first meal at
11:00 AM and their last meal

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.600 align:middle line:90%
at 6:00 PM.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.127 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll fast all
the way on water until--

00:37:04.127 --> 00:37:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
can be accomplished

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:08.110 align:middle line:84%
in the 16 to 18
hours in the body?

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Amazing things can
be accomplished in the body.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Just giving the body
16 hours of rest--

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:84%
now, that's not including
a whole other subject we

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.260 align:middle line:90%
can talk about which is stress.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Because stress will put
you in a sympathetic state.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
a sympathetic state,

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.135 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
secreting a lot of cortisol,

00:37:28.135 --> 00:37:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and your adrenals, and your body
is going to be out of balance,

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to be
damaging your own body

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.370 align:middle line:84%
with the chemicals
that you're producing.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And when you digest--

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and when you eat food
you should always

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.790 align:middle line:90%
be in a parasympathetic state.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And a parasympathetic
state means your digestion

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.120 align:middle line:90%
is actually working.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Most people that eat eat
in a sympathetic state.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're eating or
watching TV, if you're

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.790 align:middle line:84%
eating while you're driving,
if you're eating at the office,

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.040 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating
watching the news,

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating
doing anything that

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.690 align:middle line:84%
could cause you to be in
a stressful situation,

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're not sitting there,
and you're in a relaxed state,

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:84%
then you are shutting down
your digestive process again.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Which you know,
your energy levels

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.330 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
out of whack there.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend starting slowly
with intermittent fasting,

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and that is something that you
can work into your normal diet.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.797 align:middle line:84%
And you can stay on an
intermittent fasting program

00:38:24.797 --> 00:38:25.880 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we know now that we're
eating 80% more food than we

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.840 align:middle line:90%
should be eating.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
start transitioning--

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.040 align:middle line:84%
once you're on
intermittent fasting,

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:84%
then you can start
transitioning into eliminating

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.270 align:middle line:90%
more things from your diet.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Slowly eliminating
meat from your diet,

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.850 align:middle line:84%
eliminating sugar, and
then slowly starting

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:51.230 align:middle line:84%
going into a ketogenic or doing
ketogenic for a couple of weeks

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and then transitioning maybe
into some more fruit or some

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:58.670 align:middle line:84%
of the other good healthy
things, and then cycling in.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What I noticed when
I was talking about that kind

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.530 align:middle line:90%
of just a green-based diet--

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:84%
mostly leafy vegetables, low
carbohydrate vegetables--

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.350 align:middle line:84%
is that after that
period of time

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:11.960 align:middle line:84%
was the amount of
just stuff that

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.910 align:middle line:84%
is contained within your guts
that just eliminates, right?

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And your whole
body feels lighter

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.860 align:middle line:84%
in really a relatively
short period of time

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.350 align:middle line:84%
by just releasing whatever
is causing all-- oftentimes

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:28.550 align:middle line:84%
leaky gut, all the swelling
in the guts and so forth,

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:32.340 align:middle line:84%
retention of water, retention
of garbage, and so forth.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:38.390 align:middle line:84%
It does have a very rapid
effect on just allowing the body

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:41.325 align:middle line:90%
to feel svelte from the inside.

00:39:41.325 --> 00:39:42.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, regardless
of whatever weight

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:middle line:84%
you're losing by way
of fat on the outside,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:84%
you just feel better,
and lighter, and cleaner.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.990 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: You know, everything
is based on toxicity in food,

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and for thousands
of years people

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.360 align:middle line:84%
have gone through some form
of cleanse and detoxification.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And we've just lost
that philosophy.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.660 align:middle line:84%
If people were just to cleanse
their body on a regular basis,

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:84%
eat healthier, take some
time to focus on themselves

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.930 align:middle line:84%
through some
personal development,

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:16.680 align:middle line:84%
spiritual development,
meditation.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.680 align:middle line:84%
It's really not that
hard when you just

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.370 align:middle line:84%
incorporate a few things
into your daily routine--

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:28.350 align:middle line:84%
proper sleep, dealing with your
stress levels, eating healthy.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And being aware that all
of these things that I'm

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.830 align:middle line:84%
doing to myself are
damaging myself,

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and I just need to take some
time for myself every so often

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and cleanse my body.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.390 align:middle line:84%
People that go through
intestinal cleanses

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:44.940 align:middle line:84%
sometimes have 15,
20 pounds of stuff

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that they come out
of those systems.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.850 align:middle line:90%

>>GROUP: --forever,
forever, forever.

00:40:50.562 --> 00:40:54.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just like if you made three
meals a day in your kitchen

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and you never
cleaned the kitchen,

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.838 align:middle line:90%
what would happen after a week?

00:40:58.838 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you would have
like mold and things

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.040 align:middle line:90%
growing off of all your plates.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that whole kitchen
would be a toxic dump site.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you couldn't
even go in there

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.268 align:middle line:84%
because it would just
be disease ridden.

00:41:10.268 --> 00:41:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
happens inside the system, too.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just people are so
busy, and people are always--

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.450 align:middle line:84%
there's so many things to keep
people looking outside of where

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.760 align:middle line:84%
they need to be, and
their attention--

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.313 align:middle line:84%
bringing their attention
in so many other directions

00:41:27.313 --> 00:41:28.980 align:middle line:84%
that they're having
a hard time focusing

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.780 align:middle line:90%
their attention on themself.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And I-- this just
flashed to mind.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Years ago-- it was an
amazing experience--

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I went to visit a
man-- an old man,

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:41.490 align:middle line:84%
he was 82 years old--
in the Sierra foothills.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.833 align:middle line:84%
And I had read about
him and thought, gosh,

00:41:44.833 --> 00:41:46.750 align:middle line:84%
he's not that far away,
I'm going to find him.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:47.970 align:middle line:90%
So I hunted him down.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.168 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'd love to come
and hear your life story.

00:41:50.168 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Went to his place and
it turns out his name

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:90%
was Stanley Burroughs.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Stanley Burroughs is the one
that created the lemonade diet.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.900 align:middle line:84%
He had a little tiny book
called "The Lemonade Diet."

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one now
you find his formula

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.090 align:middle line:90%
in every health food store.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.033 align:middle line:84%
Lemonade, maple syrup, a
little bit of cayenne pepper.

00:42:09.033 --> 00:42:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: The Master Cleanse.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.408 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Master Cleanse.

00:42:11.408 --> 00:42:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It was just called the
lemonade diet originally.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And the way he had
come into prominence

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:84%
is that I believe it was
the governor of Oregon where

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.610 align:middle line:90%
he lived at the time.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:21.940 align:middle line:90%
He was in the circus as a kid--

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, as a young guy.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:27.210 align:middle line:84%
He was just this wild,
passionate, very fit young man.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But he stumbled upon this, and
so he put the governor of I

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.563 align:middle line:90%
believe Oregon--

00:42:33.563 --> 00:42:35.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the
governor-- on the lemonade diet

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:84%
because he had been
diagnosed with cancer

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:38.820 align:middle line:90%
and it was pretty progressed.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was on the lemonade
diet or the Master

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Cleanse for three weeks and the
cancer, of course, was clear.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So he was given the right to
practice his lemonade diet

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.640 align:middle line:90%
in Oregon.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Coming to California
and living there,

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:56.490 align:middle line:84%
people started
becoming litigious,

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of crazy things
started happening to him,

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:03.012 align:middle line:84%
and he started shutting down
his ability to work with--

00:43:03.012 --> 00:43:04.470 align:middle line:84%
he started shutting
it down himself

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:07.530 align:middle line:84%
because he had been taken
to court over this one

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:12.240 align:middle line:84%
really tough case where he put
a young man who has had cancer

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.400 align:middle line:84%
on a lemonade diet
and then his mother

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.550 align:middle line:84%
started insisting on
two coffee enemas a day

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:18.840 align:middle line:90%
when he was in the hospital.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
the kid died basically.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And they blame Stanley
for the lemonade diet, not

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:84%
all the coffee enemas
and the other things

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.110 align:middle line:90%
that were being done to him.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:33.030 align:middle line:84%
But the point is he's 82
when I met him and he was

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:34.600 align:middle line:90%
a fruitarian at the time.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's no lack of carbs,
he was living on banana--

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I saw they just brought in the
crates of bananas, oranges,

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and apples, and that's
all he lived on.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And he had these massive
arms, and strong hands,

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:90%
and he looked great.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Clear blue eyes,
handsome, youthful.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a sexual
thing, but he had just

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.980 align:middle line:84%
married some 24 or
25 year old girl

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.320 align:middle line:84%
to give her I think a
green card or something,

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and she was just there as his
assistant bringing him fruit.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But the point was he was
living a really vital life.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.260 align:middle line:90%
And the guy was a master healer.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that
people knew that about him.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And he could put his--

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and he did this on me--

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:84%
put his hands on
my throat, and did

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:84%
like what we'd consider a
miraculous thing at the time.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, I never forgot
that because when ketogenics

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.440 align:middle line:84%
came along and all these
other stories I thought,

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.260 align:middle line:84%
it was interesting, he
does it on all fruit

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.440 align:middle line:90%
versus all vegetables.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
ways to skin that cat,

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:38.670 align:middle line:84%
but by and large you want to get
rid of the extra carbohydrates,

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.920 align:middle line:84%
i.e. the glucose in
the body in order

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to get that particular
effect going.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:45.600 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when you
use the Master Cleanse

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.860 align:middle line:90%
diet or the lemonade diet?

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Has a little bit of
maple syrup in it.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.730 align:middle line:84%
People still heal
from cancer and get

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.450 align:middle line:90%
these incredible effects.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, people still
heal the Gerson therapy, too,

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:56.370 align:middle line:90%
on juicing.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you can do juice fasting
and just do nothing but juice,

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:05.850 align:middle line:10%
or they had the grape diet that
came out years ago in the 1940s

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.175 align:middle line:10%
and people would just eat--

00:45:07.175 --> 00:45:09.300 align:middle line:10%
it was called the grape
fast, and people would just

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.730 align:middle line:10%
eat nothing but grapes
and chew the seeds.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And the fruitarian, people
just on a fruitarian diet.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
what he was, yeah.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: It just
depends on all--

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think that there's
a lot of different ways

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.560 align:middle line:90%
that the body can heal itself.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.480 align:middle line:90%
It might take a lot.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
how much time you have

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and which method
you want to use.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.630 align:middle line:84%
With the lemon, lemon
juice is incredible

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:32.972 align:middle line:84%
because it's the highest
concentration of negative ions

00:45:32.972 --> 00:45:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're putting
in your system.

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And the negative ions are
going to, through an oxidation

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.440 align:middle line:84%
reduction reaction, attach to
any positively charged toxins,

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.540 align:middle line:84%
neutralize them,
attach to positively

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.250 align:middle line:84%
charged harmful
organisms which I believe

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of those doctors
believed back then,

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.150 align:middle line:84%
including Roy Rife who
identified pleomorphism

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.640 align:middle line:84%
where a bacteria can
change to a virus,

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and a virus can
change to a yeast,

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and organisms can
change that one

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.830 align:middle line:84%
of the things that modern
medicine is not looking at--

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
in our natural field

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:09.380 align:middle line:84%
now know this because they know
that pretty much everybody is

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.680 align:middle line:84%
overrun with yeast,
and Candida, and mold,

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and all these things is
that how big of a role

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.240 align:middle line:84%
do these organisms play
inside of our system.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So when you do do
a fruitarian diet

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.410 align:middle line:84%
or you do start doing the
Master Cleanse, I think that--

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.570 align:middle line:90%
or fasting, for example--

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.710 align:middle line:84%
what happens is your internal
environment begins to change,

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:35.030 align:middle line:84%
your pH begins to change, your
immune system becomes stronger,

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and your self-healing mechanism,
you're allowing your body

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to heal itself because
your digestive system

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:42.950 align:middle line:84%
with the Master
Cleanse is not going

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:middle line:84%
to be-- you don't
have solid foods,

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.550 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of solid
foods in there.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.008 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You get
a few tablespoons

00:46:48.008 --> 00:46:48.920 align:middle line:90%
of maple syrup a day.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Pure energy, right?

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's all about energy.

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Your energy that you
have is not breaking down

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:58.430 align:middle line:84%
big, thick, fibrous
protein meals.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.430 align:middle line:84%
You're just liquid,
and that's going

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to be more energy that your body
can use to focus on healing.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi was a big
proponent of fasting.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi fasted one day
every single week,

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and once a year he fasted
for eight to 10 days.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.410 align:middle line:84%
When he was assassinated
at age 78, when

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:16.910 align:middle line:84%
they did an autopsy
on him they said

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:19.310 align:middle line:84%
he had the body of
a 40-year-old man.

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So just one day a week fasting
on nothing but water, one--

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:30.380 align:middle line:84%
like let's say six days a year
would do tremendous benefit

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.980 align:middle line:84%
for you as even with you
doing a fruitarian diet,

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.140 align:middle line:84%
or you doing this, or doing
any type of live foods.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Dr Seyfried at the
University of Boston

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:45.450 align:middle line:84%
just came out not too long ago
and said the exact same thing

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:46.250 align:middle line:90%
that Gandhi said.

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:52.550 align:middle line:84%
He said that if you fast for
six to eight days once a year--

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.830 align:middle line:90%
just once a year--

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:58.610 align:middle line:84%
he believes that will reduce
your chances of getting cancer

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:01.490 align:middle line:90%
by 99%.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So any of those
techniques-- juice fasting,

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.500 align:middle line:90%
grape fasting, Master Cleanse--

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.120 align:middle line:84%
you're just giving
your body a rest.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:15.050 align:middle line:84%
You're just-- anything that
you do to take time off

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:90%
for yourself--

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and it all starts with
detoxification and cleansing--

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.260 align:middle line:84%
those are the most
successful ways

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.750 align:middle line:84%
because you have to take
two steps back before you

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.370 align:middle line:90%
take two steps forward.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:28.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest mistakes
that practitioners are making

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:30.620 align:middle line:84%
is people come in, they
look at their symptoms,

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.600 align:middle line:84%
and they prescribe them
something for their symptoms.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.923 align:middle line:84%
So one of the big mistakes
that practitioners are making--

00:48:36.923 --> 00:48:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's not that the
practitioners are really

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.397 align:middle line:84%
making mistakes, it's what
the practitioners are taught.

00:48:41.397 --> 00:48:42.980 align:middle line:84%
What they're taught
in medical school,

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.772 align:middle line:84%
what they're taught in
chiropractic school,

00:48:44.772 --> 00:48:47.090 align:middle line:84%
what they're taught in
naturopathic school.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:50.330 align:middle line:84%
They're still taught to address
the symptoms of the disease

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:53.570 align:middle line:84%
or the condition instead
of the root cause.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, I love
naturopathic physicians,

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I love chiropractors, I
love massage therapists.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's doing any type
of energy work, anything that

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:06.830 align:middle line:84%
can help anybody teach and
evaluate somebody and let them

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:09.390 align:middle line:84%
know what the root cause
of their situation is.

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:10.940 align:middle line:90%
But I still think that--

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm still trying to
figure out why cleansing

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and why fasting is
not being taught

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:17.090 align:middle line:90%
in even the natural schools.

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:19.072 align:middle line:84%
Because we actually
did a study--

00:49:19.072 --> 00:49:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, why isn't it?

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.197 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: I don't know.

00:49:21.197 --> 00:49:25.530 align:middle line:84%
We did a study which was
a fascinating study where

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:26.330 align:middle line:90%
we took--

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:27.680 align:middle line:90%
this was about 15 years ago--

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:32.270 align:middle line:84%
20 to 30 people and we evaluated
them when they came in.

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:34.130 align:middle line:90%
We had a health questionnaire.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.610 align:middle line:84%
They filled out all the things
that were wrong with them.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:37.610 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't fast them.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:40.570 align:middle line:84%
We put on an intestinal cleanse,
one liver and gall bladder

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.040 align:middle line:84%
cleanse, a harmful organism
cleanse, and a chemical

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.690 align:middle line:90%
and heavy metal cleanse.

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Then we re-evaluated them again.

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.300 align:middle line:84%
To our-- well, we weren't
too shocked about it,

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.090 align:middle line:84%
but what we found was
all those symptoms they

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:57.050 align:middle line:84%
had in the initial meeting,
most of those if not all of them

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.060 align:middle line:90%
were completely gone.

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And now they even-- now
they had additional symptoms

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:06.290 align:middle line:84%
or different symptoms
from the initial meeting.

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:09.140 align:middle line:90%
So what did that tell us?

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:12.200 align:middle line:84%
That told us that pretty much
everybody out there right

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.450 align:middle line:90%
now is being misdiagnosed.

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if every doctor
was to clean-- you know,

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:19.610 align:middle line:84%
you came in with
all these symptoms

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:21.435 align:middle line:84%
and they were to
say, OK, what we

00:50:21.435 --> 00:50:23.060 align:middle line:84%
have to do is we have
to clean you out,

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.602 align:middle line:84%
we have to go through
these cleanses,

00:50:24.602 --> 00:50:25.760 align:middle line:90%
and then come back in.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.450 align:middle line:84%
We'll reevaluate you and we'll
see what symptoms are there.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:31.928 align:middle line:84%
So that means most of the
diagnoses are wrong because--

00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in seven
minutes you're basically

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:35.033 align:middle line:90%
looking skin deep.

00:50:35.033 --> 00:50:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course
you're not going

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.850 align:middle line:84%
to be able to diagnose
anyone in seven minutes.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:40.160 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.700 align:middle line:84%
This has been very inspirational
hearing the story of fasting,

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and also I'm glad we're
looking at it from a lot

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.028 align:middle line:90%
of different perspectives.

00:50:48.028 --> 00:50:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to talk
about your tinctures

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.040 align:middle line:84%
just because I've been
wondering through the years

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.840 align:middle line:84%
since we talked a few
years ago whatever

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.625 align:middle line:90%
happened to that project.

00:50:55.625 --> 00:50:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked
you yesterday, you

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.880 align:middle line:84%
said, well, funny
you should ask.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.470 align:middle line:84%
We're just now coming out
with the very first one.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about the
tincture project.

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:08.090 align:middle line:84%
These are raw herbal tinctures,
and that's normally not done.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: It's a raw
herbal extract technology,

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and as I was digging
deeper and deeper

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.040 align:middle line:84%
into neutraceutical research
and trying to track back

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:21.440 align:middle line:84%
how the herbs are grown, and
the process that it takes

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.950 align:middle line:84%
from soil to
supplement, let's say,

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:27.320 align:middle line:84%
for whatever you're
wanting to take out

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.242 align:middle line:84%
there in wherever store you
go and get your supplement.

00:51:30.242 --> 00:51:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
know that there's

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different things
that happen from the time

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.710 align:middle line:84%
that that seed is planted
to the time it actually

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.850 align:middle line:90%
goes into the supplement.

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So as I was looking at
different technologies

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:45.710 align:middle line:84%
on how we can maximize all of
the components of the Earth,

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:49.400 align:middle line:84%
how can we bring all
of the therapeutics in?

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I had to go back to the soil
because the soil is where

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.520 align:middle line:90%
pretty much everything happens.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So looking at what is
going on in the soil,

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.850 align:middle line:84%
how the plants are
grown, and then

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:04.490 align:middle line:84%
how the plants are
harvested has something

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:05.870 align:middle line:90%
to do with it as well.

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could have people
with negative attitudes

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:12.170 align:middle line:84%
harvesting plants or harvesting
at different moon cycles which

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.880 align:middle line:84%
can affect the therapeutic
compounds of the plant.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the most
important things we found

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.970 align:middle line:84%
is how the herbs
are actually dried.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
the majority of Arabs

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:26.840 align:middle line:84%
out there are dried at 160, 150
degrees in these big driers.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So all of the essential
oils, the oleoresins,

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:36.350 align:middle line:84%
like probably close to
75% of the therapeutic

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:41.093 align:middle line:84%
constituents in the plant are
lost during the drying process.

00:52:41.093 --> 00:52:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not lost
in the drying process,

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:45.140 align:middle line:84%
they're lost in the
powdering process

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.390 align:middle line:84%
because those go
through the plant,

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:51.000 align:middle line:84%
then it's harvested in
the leaves, and deleaved

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.800 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.133 align:middle line:84%
And then it has to go through
a powdering process and it

00:52:54.133 --> 00:52:57.560 align:middle line:84%
usually goes through a
hammer mill, and then it's--

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.900 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the constituents
in the therapeutic compounds

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.230 align:middle line:84%
are lost during the
powdering process.

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes to
the extraction process.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, no one's really
changed the extraction

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.840 align:middle line:84%
or the tincturing process
in hundreds of years.

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.310 align:middle line:84%
They're still using
alcohol, which

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.170 align:middle line:84%
is an endocrine
disrupting chemical.

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And alcohol still
denatures a lot

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.460 align:middle line:84%
of the constituents
in the plants.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So we looked at how can we
change this up at every step

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:26.210 align:middle line:84%
of the way to where we can
get all the constituents--

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:30.230 align:middle line:84%
or as many as we possibly
can-- not do it in alcohol,

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:34.520 align:middle line:84%
but even the extraction process
alone do a cold raw extraction

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.270 align:middle line:84%
process instead of
having to heat--

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:38.360 align:middle line:90%
it's like a tea, right?

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.610 align:middle line:84%
You use hot water in your
tea and it extracts it,

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:44.450 align:middle line:84%
but there's still a lot of
components left in the plant.

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So we looked and
studied ancient alchemy,

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Paracelsus' work from the 1400s
where he would never throw away

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:52.640 align:middle line:90%
the plant material.

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.500 align:middle line:84%
He would take the
plant material,

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and he would extract the
salts from the plant,

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and he would use
meditation over the plant,

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and use different
types of basically what

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.440 align:middle line:84%
he called a spagyric process
which was to separate

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and then recombine the plant all
in one to bring it back to life

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.400 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we've been
working on years, and years,

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and years.

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the
ancient alchemists,

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:19.160 align:middle line:84%
it takes a lot of time
and effort to do that.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient alchemists
would only make a small amount.

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to use
modern day technology, yet

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:29.450 align:middle line:84%
the ancient technology,
and bring a true living

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:31.280 align:middle line:90%
raw essence of the plant.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And we use a certified
organic vegetable glycerin

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:38.520 align:middle line:84%
instead of alcohol, which we
developed a technique called

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.150 align:middle line:84%
the glycerospheric technology
where we're actually

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:42.410 align:middle line:90%
able to wrap--

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:44.660 align:middle line:84%
like a lipospheric--
the components

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.870 align:middle line:84%
of the plant in the
glycerin matrix,

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and deliver that, and deliver
the full spectrum of the plant

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:56.930 align:middle line:84%
to you in a raw herbal
extract technology.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an example
of the turmeric product

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:02.780 align:middle line:84%
that we developed
using this technology.

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:05.930 align:middle line:84%
We took like six or
seven of the top selling

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:09.500 align:middle line:84%
turmeric products that
are out on the market.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Rayne right now is a
doctor that's being able,

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and he's been
advancing technology

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to be able to test
for the quantum energy

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.500 align:middle line:90%
levels in things.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.390 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of
what's been missing.

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like we with the ormus
fields, and the energy

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:27.200 align:middle line:84%
fields, and the
potency of things.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.850 align:middle line:84%
No one's been able to
really quantitatively test

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:32.910 align:middle line:90%
with some device.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.390 align:middle line:84%
We can do energetic testing,
muscle testing, and things,

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but not actually have real
live scientific testing

00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:43.910 align:middle line:90%
to test energy levels with.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And he tested ours versus
all the other ones out there

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:49.680 align:middle line:84%
because ours has the salts
in it or the energy--

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.130 align:middle line:84%
we call them energized trace
minerals that we take out

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:54.200 align:middle line:90%
and we add back in.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And ours was 10 to 30,000 times
more energetically potent.

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's like-- it's
almost like taking a wine

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.780 align:middle line:90%
and then culturing it.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:08.870 align:middle line:84%
These formulas get better
and stronger with age

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:12.820 align:middle line:84%
like the alchemy formulas the
Paracelsus was working on.

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Like if you even leave by
mistake some of the plant

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:20.060 align:middle line:84%
salts on a dish and you
come back three weeks later,

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:24.220 align:middle line:84%
the plant salts are growing
and it grows off the dish

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.404 align:middle line:90%
onto the desk.

00:56:25.404 --> 00:56:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, It's amazing
what we can do.

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But the whole purpose is to
bring the essence of nature,

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and the balance of nature,
and the soil, and the seed,

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and the plant, and all
of the constituents

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that the plant has
grown specifically

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.820 align:middle line:84%
for you to help you
bring that energy back

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:48.020 align:middle line:84%
into your body to help you
address what needs to be

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.270 align:middle line:90%
addressed inside your system.

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's
why I am still

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.350 align:middle line:90%
a proponent of supplementation.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Even though we know
with water-only fasting,

00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and with detoxification,
and cleansing,

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that's a starting
point to get your body

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:05.205 align:middle line:84%
ready to accept the
nutrients, or the herbs,

00:57:05.205 --> 00:57:06.830 align:middle line:84%
or anything else that
you want to take.

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And that way for
sure that you're

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:11.390 align:middle line:84%
going to get a really,
really good effect.

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Like most people on average
get between 2% and 10% activity

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:17.450 align:middle line:90%
from whatever they're taking.

00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:19.460 align:middle line:84%
If you buy anything
from a drug store,

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:23.090 align:middle line:84%
a big retailer like that, you're
probably just actually causing

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:26.260 align:middle line:84%
more harm because you're getting
toxins through the magnesium

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.850 align:middle line:84%
stearate, through the silicon
dioxide, and the titanium

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:31.015 align:middle line:84%
dioxide, and the synthetic
vitamins, and minerals,

00:57:31.015 --> 00:57:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and nutrients that
you're taking.

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't bother.

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And this process takes
10, 20 times longer

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.930 align:middle line:84%
than a normal tincture
process, so how

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:41.668 align:middle line:90%
are you working this out?

00:57:41.668 --> 00:57:43.210 align:middle line:84%
When are the products
available, when

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.630 align:middle line:84%
are you kind of
up in production,

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:46.047 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of
price point is it

00:57:46.047 --> 00:57:49.550 align:middle line:84%
going to end up at with that
amount of labor involved?

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, let's just
say if you were to take--

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:57.370 align:middle line:84%
we were about to launch
our moringa, actually.

00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:01.780 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out on
the 4th of April.

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.990 align:middle line:84%
You might have to spend five
times as much money taking

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:07.360 align:middle line:84%
a moringa from the
store for three months

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:10.170 align:middle line:84%
as you would taking
a raw herbal extract

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:14.920 align:middle line:84%
moringa that's going to be
highly energized, highly raw.

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have most of
the constituents in it--

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.380 align:middle line:90%
a lot more than anything else.

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.380 align:middle line:84%
The price points we're going
to try to keep affordable,

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:24.760 align:middle line:84%
of course, because we just
want to help as many people--

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Within normal human--

00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:26.850 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --as we can It's not
going to be outrageous price,

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.920 align:middle line:90%
but you get what you pay for.

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:38.920 align:middle line:84%
You could take a drugstore
based multivitamin for 10 years

00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're actually
getting worse.

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.850 align:middle line:84%
You think you're saving
money, but in the long run

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.560 align:middle line:84%
you're not because it's actually
causing harm on your body

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.980 align:middle line:90%
instead of helping you.

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Or you could pay
a little bit extra

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:53.320 align:middle line:90%
and get more benefit from it.

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.797 align:middle line:84%
I was just wondering
if he's going to be

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.597 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing
besides moringa?

00:59:03.597 --> 00:59:04.805 align:middle line:90%

turmeric, we have moringa,

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.430 align:middle line:84%
we're coming out with a
holy basil or a tulsi,

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and then we're coming
out with organ blends.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Like a blend for your
liver, and different blends

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:18.370 align:middle line:84%
for your organs to
give you the support--

00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:20.220 align:middle line:90%
that organ support.

something so potentized

00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:35.640 align:middle line:90%

love to do with you one day.

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:03.010 align:middle line:90%
