>>REGINA MEREDITH: I am a
lover of historical fiction.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:10%
It brings life's
dilemmas and the emotions

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
that drive them into
the historical themes,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:10%
so they come alive.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
In Barbara Hand Clow's
new work of fiction,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
"Revelations of
the Aquarian Age,"

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:84%
a stark history of abuse
within the Catholic church,

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:84%
extraordinarily wealthy ancient
bloodlines, and the process

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:84%
of healing together in a
bold story of revelations.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a thing that
some other authors have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
tried to do as well, which is to
weave together these incredibly

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
complex themes without having
your character assassinated,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.902 align:middle line:84%
which would happen if you
wrote it as non-fiction.

00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA HAND CLOW: Well,
there wouldn't be any characters

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:90%
if it was non-fiction.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.724 align:middle line:84%
There wouldn't be
any characters.

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, even weaving the
themes together is challenging.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:10%
And you can do this
any way you want.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:10%
And it's a lovely journey.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a really interesting ride.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:10%
So first of all, before
we go any further,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:10%
let's talk about the first
book where we ended up,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:10%
"Revelations of
the Ruby Crystal,"

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:10%
and how that led
us into this story.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:10%
>> HAND CLOW: Let's see.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:10%
So at the end of "Ruby
Crystal," Armando

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:10%
has just met and fallen in love
with Jennifer, Simon's sister.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to go over them

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:90%
again-- the key characters.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So then when we go
into the second book,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
this was the perfect
opportunity in a novel.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Because each novel has
to be a standalone.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So whenever new
character comes back,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
you have to have the
background of that character--

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
not as much detail as in
the first book, of course.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So that gave me the
opportunity to have

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:84%
"Aquarian Age" begin with
the wedding of Jennifer

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:90%
and Armando.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So the novel opens
with the wedding.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the characters
come to the wedding.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and, of course, we

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:90%
love it, because it's in Italy.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And also, as far
as I could tell,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:84%
from talking to people who
had read "Ruby Crystal,"

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
they were just so happy to
have the characters back again.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Because people have become
fond of the characters.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the goal, as
far as I'm concerned.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has different
ideas about fiction.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But I think the most important
thing is the characters.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Because when you read complex
material or information

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:84%
about a historical era, if you
do it through characterization,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:84%
the people who read
the book remember.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It brings
the emotions in.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It brings in more
multi-dimensional memory,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.416 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one
of the reasons I

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:46.662 align:middle line:84%
wanted to write fiction was
to have that extra kick.

00:02:46.662 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
about it, if you

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
read a history of England,
English kings or whatever,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:90%
you can't remember anything.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:84%
But then once you read of a
fictional rendition of one

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
of those kings or
queen's life, you

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.930 align:middle line:90%
remember it forever, basically.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.471 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely--
and especially

00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:10%
if it's taken to the big
screen even more so, where

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:10%
you have music
driving the emotions

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:10%
and driving the points in.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.253 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Right.

00:03:09.253 --> 00:03:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And so my goal here was
to bring in some material

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
"Age of Pisces"

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and going into "Aquarius"
that's truly significant for us,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%
as readers.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I wanted
to create these characters.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't actually create
the characters, Regina.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.400 align:middle line:90%
They all came in one day.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:90%
May of 2011, they all came in.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And all I did was take
out my yellow pad.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
What came in was their names,
their ages, their careers,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:90%
their psychology.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they all came
in, except for one.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:90%
And one came in later.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know where
they came from exactly.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But they sure do
want to speak to us.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a story that is trying to--

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.320 align:middle line:90%
in a difficult time--

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
tell us about some
of the dysfunction

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:84%
in the darkness that's been
hidden from humanity up

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:90%
until now.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Which is now all the
whistleblowers are out,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:90%
and it's happening.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But still, I don't think
people have any understanding

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
of how ubiquitous one
of the problems that

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:90%
is demonstrated here is.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into that
when the time comes.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the
interesting part is

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:84%
that these characters,
each one of them,

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
is brilliant and has their
own area of expertise, which

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:84%
allows them to introduce
different pieces of history

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.245 align:middle line:84%
and psychology
into the storyline.

00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW:
Yeah, that's right.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.934 align:middle line:84%
And then, also, two
generations, too--

00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have that
perspective of the older

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
generation dealing with people
who were in their 30s and 40s

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and coping with
the level of change

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing
on the planet right now.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there's
two generations.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
technically three.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got a
little one in there, too--

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: We've got
a little one coming.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.081 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that is
also exemplifying

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:84%
the new consciousness, the super
sensitivity of the little ones

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:84%
that are coming in this
particular energy field.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you mentioned
Armando a little while ago.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about Armando, who
is one of the chief characters.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
comes up-- because this book

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
has areas of extreme
passion even sexuality.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Because again, that's
a part of our nature

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:90%
that's been severely repressed.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And Armando, in
this story, is being

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:84%
driven by a reptilian kind of
urge that moves through him.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's set Armando up in
this aspect of his being.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Armando is a key
player right in "Ruby Crystal."

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And when the issue
of Armando came up,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I talked to my
daughter about it.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.597 align:middle line:90%
Because I said, Lizzie--

00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Lizzie is the
illustrator of the book.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:90%
So we can bring--

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beautiful
illustrations.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: --Lizzie
into this conversation.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So I said Lizzie, this is
what's going on with Armando.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And Lizzie knows what
a nice person I am.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.522 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a well-adjusted wife,
and mother, and member of my--

00:05:42.522 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're a nice girl.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: I'm
just a nice girl.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:90%
And Lizzie said, OK, Mom.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:90%
And Lizzie's a Scorpio.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And so Lizzie said,
no matter what you do,

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Mom, make it really bad.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:90%
So I followed her advice.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I probably didn't need
to know that from her.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Because Armando, just for
me from the very beginning,

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:90%
was really a real person.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
first book, Armando

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:90%
is a very, very bad guy.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes
through a lot of therapy

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and comes to another
level, finally to the point

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
where he's able, 10 years
after a lot of therapy,

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:84%
to actually meet a woman
and end up marrying her.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the other thing that's
fascinating about Armando

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.590 align:middle line:90%
is Armando was a painter.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And Armando has a
fantastic ability

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
to bring forces, and
energy, and archetypes

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
through his consciousness
and then paint.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.349 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had a lot of
fun describing painting

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:90%
and what happens with painting.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think it's
dealt with enough in literature.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.835 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real central
theme in the book, as well,

00:06:39.835 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:90%
this one particular painting.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
But he has these other darker
urges that move through him,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and these incredible,
light-filled, unconscious

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
understandings that
just appear in his work.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
confluence of these parts

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:90%
in his being.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah, well
he, himself personally,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:84%
is struggling with a force
that I consider to be the force

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:90%
of the Archons.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:10%
This is a force
that's been identified

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:10%
by John Lash,
which is definitely

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:10%
a very reptilian force.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:10%
And so in his case, he comes
from a very good family.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And until he was sexually
abused when he was young,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
he was a very, very
happy little boy.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So he's having a
tremendous struggle

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.120 align:middle line:84%
with forces running through him
that he does not want to have.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
He does not want to be
that kind of person.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And so then, he resolves
dealing with these forces going

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:90%
through him by painting.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when we see
him painting and when

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
we see him becoming
an artist, that's

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
when we see this light
coming through him.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's right
there within him.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But he's having this
tremendous personal struggle.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The main issue of this
trilogy is, how does evil

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:90%
get into the world?

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, evil is a real
force, as far as we can tell.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But how does it
get into our world?

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Because if we could understand
how evil comes into our world,

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
then, surely, we'd
have some ways

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:84%
of transmuting it using therapy,
whatever we would choose to do.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But when I first started
this trilogy back in 2011,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:84%
it was only just beginning to be
clear what a big deal this is.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And now it's getting
bigger and bigger.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Because something
is actually going

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
on within systems of the
church that are actually

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:90%
creating these events.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:10%
And I personally feel
that Pope Francis

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:10%
is very concerned about this.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:10%
And I actually feel that he's
really trying to change things.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.542 align:middle line:10%
But he's having a big struggle.

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's having a big
struggle himself with it.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it is such it's
stayed institution.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: It's a
1,500-year creation.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:84%
To root that out, it's
an Earth-shattering and

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
psyche-shattering
experience for children.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And so in the book,
Armando isn't the only one

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:90%
in dealing with other people--

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And secrecy around it.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Right.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And showing, also, what
happened in their childhood

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and in their early
adulthood as a result

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:90%
of having been sexually abused.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was sexually
abused when I was two

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:90%
and a half to three years old.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mind saying that,
because I wrote about it.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a trilogy called "The
Mind Chronicles Trilogy."

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.040 align:middle line:90%
And I've already revealed that.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I've gone
through this experience

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:84%
personally and somehow
managed to get beyond it.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.901 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes wonder, who was
the angel that kept me going

00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and helped me go all
the way through this?

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I made it
all the way through.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.480 align:middle line:84%
But I do feel that I have
unusual understanding

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:90%
of this issue.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And then in my 30s, I almost
became a Jungian analyst.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:90%
I actually did some training.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And so there there's a
character in the book,

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.476 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful character,
Lorenzo Giannini.

00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love him.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah, I know.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.982 align:middle line:90%
I love Lorenzo.

00:09:38.982 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
He gets in the
third book, Regina--

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.314 align:middle line:84%
which, as you know, I'm
writing it right now.

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:90%
The first two are published.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'm writing the third one.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And Lorenzo ends up just
being a kingpin in the middle

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:90%
of everybody's lives.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.819 align:middle line:84%
Because gradually, they
all start going to him.

00:09:51.819 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As a therapist.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And so having almost
become a Jungian analyst,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I've had the
wonderful opportunity

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
to have a Jungian
analyst in literature.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Because then, as
a reader, we get

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
to peek into what's going on
in these analytic sessions

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:90%
with clients.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I just think that's
the most fascinating.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.359 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you on that.

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: I think all of us
would like to be able to peek

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
through a keyhole
and have an earpiece,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.016 align:middle line:84%
so we could hear
what's going on.

00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:18.181 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he has a
kind of intuitive capacity,

00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:84%
too, where he can understand
when someone's coming up

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:84%
on something and help them
look at it in a way that

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:90%
might open even to past life.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.235 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:10%
And then Lorenzo, like Carl Jung
himself, and many other Jungian

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:10%
analysts, is also a major Magus.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:10%
Many, many Jungian
analysts are highly

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:10%
trained in psychic and
magical techniques.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:10%
And so Lorenzo is unusually
gifted in that way because

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:10%
of training that he's
received himself.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:90%
So he's not just an analyst.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:90%
He's also a wonderful magician.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.280 align:middle line:90%
So go back to "Ruby Crystal."

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:10%
When I started writing
"Ruby Crystal," Ratzinger

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:10%
was the Pope--

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:10%
Benedict the 16th.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:10%
And I knew I had a book
when Ratzinger resigned,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:10%
which was an amazing thing.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd written a third
of the first book.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:90%
And Ratzinger resigned.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And so then, of course,
Francis was elected.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.907 align:middle line:84%
And so through the third book--
the second book, of course,

00:11:12.907 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
is dealing with Francis a
little bit, as you know.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:84%
But the third book, I'm
going deeply into what's

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.567 align:middle line:90%
really going on with Francis.

00:11:18.567 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.608 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:11:20.608 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Because at this point,
now we have data.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's saying
things like, there has

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:90%
been a real problem in Chile.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And he went down to Chile
and actually got himself

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:90%
into a real mess.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Because he didn't support
some of the people in Chile

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
who had been abused by
a priest and a bishop.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
after he didn't

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
support that particular
issue was the Chileans just--

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:90%
it was really wonderful.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:90%
They just rebelled en masse.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And then Francis sent in a
really fantastic investigator,

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
especially of bishops,
but of priestly abuse,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
who happens to be the
archbishop from Malta.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is really interesting,
because Pietro Pierleoni, one

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
of the main characters all
the way through this trilogy,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
is a member of the
order of Malta.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Now if I go back
it's five years ago--

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:90%
and I basically go by guidance.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And the guidance told me that
Pietro was a major player

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:90%
in the order of Malta.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I went, I don't think I'm
going to put this in the book.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:90%
What could this possibly mean?

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it turns out,
there's a really big deal

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.017 align:middle line:84%
going on with the Vatican
and the order of Malta.

00:12:28.017 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's going on?

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.969 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Well, there
is an issue of finally--

00:12:31.969 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really cracking down.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:10%
>> HAND CLOW: Well, Francis
sent in the investigator,

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:10%
this archbishop from Malta,
because he knew that he was

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:10%
the most hardcore investigator.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:10%
And this archbishop went in.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:10%
And so he went and investigated
the situation in Chile

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:10%
and came back to
Francis and said,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:10%
OK, Francis, here's the deal.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
He gave him the 2,300-page
report on what was going

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:90%
on in Chile.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And what's really incredible
to me and to everybody

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:84%
else who's following what's
going on in the Vatican,

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Francis not only said, hey,
wait a minute, I blew this.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:84%
He not only said, I
didn't see, but he said,

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I now know that
I've been misguided.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the Pope
said, and I know

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
that I'm part of the
problem, because I

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:90%
couldn't see what's going on.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.694 align:middle line:90%
So this is such a huge turn--

00:13:19.694 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a revelation.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: And this is
only like two months ago.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.984 align:middle line:84%
And so as I'm the third
book, I write on a timeline.

00:13:26.984 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do with these.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:90%
I write them on a timeline.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.299 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm writing, it's the
same time as when I'm writing.

00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And so this has already
started to come in.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea
where it's going to go.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:90%
But I do know one thing.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
This pope is going to make
a significant difference.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And probably because
we know that we're

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:84%
at that point in time where
significant things are

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.662 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:13:45.662 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Things just aren't
getting stuffed.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.286 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to stuff it,
it doesn't work anymore.

00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Because you immediately
have an attack online.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: It's changing.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting--
what you said

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:84%
about garnering
American support,

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:84%
so they keep money
flowing into the Vatican.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And in this documentary,
it was interesting,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:90%
because he's standing before--

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Congress.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was basically,
in his usual way,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
chastising them
for funding weapons

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:84%
to, quote, "rebels"
in the Middle East

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and saying that, in order to
achieve our goals on Earth,

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.337 align:middle line:90%
this must stop.

00:14:23.337 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:90%
It was like, they're, hm--

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.396 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know quite
how to take that.

00:14:26.396 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%
He does seem to be
sincerely trying

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.520 align:middle line:84%
to draw attention to the
right things at this time,

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
even if his actions
have not yet fully been

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
made manifest to
address the problem.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So I bring it up, because this
is at the base of the story.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Secrecy around the
subject is at the base.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.360 align:middle line:84%
This incredible pain these
men have been living in

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:84%
is at the base of their
characters in this story.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go into some
of the historical parts.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Because you have Simon,
who is a journalist.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.490 align:middle line:84%
You have all these beautiful
academic women, as well.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And they bring in the story
of the ancient Mandaeans,

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.246 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: The Age of what?

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was it the Mandaeans?

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Mandaeans.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mandaeans,
remnants of the Babylonians.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And now you're putting in
here, at the opening chapters,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
timelines of what's happening
militarily around the world,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.282 align:middle line:84%
especially at the hands
of the American military.

00:15:19.282 --> 00:15:20.406 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And also, Regina,
I'd like to say

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:84%
that all of the
background information,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
the historical timelines,
the history of religion,

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
all of that stuff is totally
factual and totally--

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: And then the
characters and the storyline is

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:90%
completely fictional.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But the historical
data is accurate.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And so now, why did--
the Simon character--

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.000 align:middle line:84%
why did you begin
weaving in these stories

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
of these various sects,
such as the Mandaeans?

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And talk about them
for a moment and why

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:84%
this matters at this point
in time in our history.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Well, when the
time timeline on the second

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
book occurred is basically
2014 through 2017.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is the period when
ISIS became really powerful,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and went in and invaded
the Yazidi territory,

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and kidnapped all the
women, and everything,

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and pulled off such horrible
knifings on television,

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
purposes of this trilogy

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:84%
is to track the timeline
historically from 2011

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:28.150 align:middle line:84%
through 2020, because I believe
that this is the vortex turning

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
point into the Age of Aquarius
and out of the Age of Pisces.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So that type of
material is in the book

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:84%
so that we could see
what's going away.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Because for example,
specifically, there

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:90%
is a bunch of Christian sects--

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and some people are familiar
with the Copts in Egypt.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And they also were a Christian
sect-- or the Mandaeans

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:90%
and the Druze Christians.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the Middle East, there
are a group of Christian sects.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.152 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
unknown to Americans--

00:16:56.152 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
what these people
have been doing--

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.151 align:middle line:84%
because they're Christians, and
they're people of the heart--

00:17:00.151 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
is they have basically
kept society together.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.359 align:middle line:90%
They've fed people.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:90%
They've housed people.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:84%
They've created medical
protection for people.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All charitable acts.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.585 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: All
throughout the Middle East.

00:17:10.585 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And so when George Bush
went into Iraq in 2003,

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:84%
what George Bush did is he
blew up the Middle East.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.089 align:middle line:84%
This is, of course, before
the timeline of the novel.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
But he blew up the Middle East.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And then that
created a huge enmity

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
between the Shia and
the Sunni Muslim people.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And it has continued since then
in the war in Syria, et cetera.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how did
these other factions

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:90%
get caught in the crossfire?

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.881 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Well,
the Christian sects are

00:17:36.881 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:84%
so important is they were
basically people of heart who

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:84%
were kind of go-betweens between
the animosity between these two

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:90%
segments of Islam.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they've gotten
completely flushed out.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:90%
They've been forced to leave.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
ironic, actually.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:90%
I come from Michigan.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Michigan.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And Detroit, at this point,
has the largest gathering

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:03.130 align:middle line:84%
of Middle Eastern Christians
in the United States.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.400 align:middle line:90%
It's just filled.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Because as you know, with the
collapse of the automobile

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
industry, Detroit, and Flint,
and Saginaw just basically

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:90%
were vacant.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's all filled up with
Middle Eastern Christians.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.734 align:middle line:84%
And they have a really
vibrant culture there.

00:18:16.734 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And these people are
going all over the world.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
wonderful people.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:90%
But I wanted to document that.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
such a-- speaking

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:84%
of the change of the ages and
going out of the Age of Pisces.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:84%
The Age of Pisces was the
age of organized religion.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to give
information on this

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
this transformation
of the organized

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:90%
religions of the Age of Pisces.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's why
that's in the book.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Marcionites,
as well, another faction.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And also, you
mentioned the Yazidis,

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But most people aren't clear
exactly who they are, except

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
for the role you just said as
providing this kind of grace,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
or this kind of charity,
or something in the region

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to keep the factions off
each other's backs a bit.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And is that true of all
of the different factions

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of these various
Christian Arabic groups,

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:90%
like Marsh Arabs, as you say?

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.675 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: No, some are.

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, for instance, the Yazidis
are a 10,000-year-old early

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:90%
religious sect.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:10%
They aren't really Christian.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.189 align:middle line:10%
And so what you
heard on the media

00:19:13.189 --> 00:19:14.480 align:middle line:10%
is they were devil worshippers.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:10%
Well, they're not
devil worshippers.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:10%
They're just simply early
really Pagan spiritual people.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And what most people
know about the Yazidis is

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:84%
the sexual slavery
system that ISIS created,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
which was actually a genocide
of the Yazidi people.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'm covering these
issues, because--

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, here I am writing a
book that's documenting 2011

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:84%
through 2020, which, as
you know at this point,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most complex
periods in human history.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And so my issue, as a novelist,
was selection of detail.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And so these issues
are in there to create

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:84%
an understanding of some of the
things that are passing away.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Because these elements of
Christianity are passing away.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't go in and bomb
countries to flush everybody

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:84%
out and make everybody
get on the road

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
without creating a
decimation of culture.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
we're experiencing.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm mainly there
to document it.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.742 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:90%
And in amongst this--

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
relatively modern
history, anyway--

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.085 align:middle line:84%
you bring in the
Fatima prophecies.

00:20:16.085 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: OK.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the Fatima
prophecies are the prophecies

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
for the 20th through
21st century.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And the first two prophecies
of Fatima have been fulfilled.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And please, tell
people what happened then

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.845 align:middle line:90%
and what the prophecies are.

00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Most people
actually know about this.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
This was three Portuguese
girls, two of them quite young.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And then one of them was seven,
or eight, or nine years old.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And they saw a bunch
of visions on the edge

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:90%
of a hill in Portugal.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So the oldest one
wrote down the visions.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, as they
started to come true,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.802 align:middle line:84%
this information was
given to the popes.

00:20:56.802 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was the
information coming true?

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Well, this one
girl Portuguese girl wrote it

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:84%
The girls were put in
a nunnery after this.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But then the popes got a hold
of the Fatima prophecies.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And the first one
was of World War I.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
was of World War II.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And these are two things that
these little girls couldn't

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:90%
possibly have known about.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
one is hidden.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, I'm
using it in the novel.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Because the third one
has to do with the end

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:84%
of the Age of Pisces
and going into Aquarius.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And the best speculations that
I've been able to find so far

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
are that the third
Fatima prophecy

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:84%
is prophesying a apostasy,
which means the emptying

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
out of the faithful
out of the church.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the Catholic church
is tremendously diminished

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:90%
But I was a Catholic.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Once you're Catholic,
you're on the roles forever.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Once you're Catholic,
you're a Catholic forever.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So the actual
number of Catholics

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:84%
who are actually practicing
and actually giving money

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:90%
to the church is plummeting.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And Francis fears
this very much.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:90%
He's said so.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to visit some
other areas, too, historically.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's talk about one
of the characters in this

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:84%
who had an experience where
she flew out of her body

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and ended up finding
herself having

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:84%
an encounter with a group
of beings from Sirius.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about how now we
the cosmological and ET element

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:90%
starts coming into the story.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: I think you
must be talking about Claudia.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: OK.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.401 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because I don't

00:22:37.401 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:90%
think I said it was Sirius.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think the way
I described it made

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:90%
it sound like it was Sirius.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have to go back--

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, take a peek.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: I have
to go back and look.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm only getting
that explicit more or less

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.080 align:middle line:90%
on the third book.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But Claudia meets Lorenzo
Giannini, the Jungian analyst.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's wonderful.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.164 align:middle line:84%
It's the only time
we allowed out

00:22:59.164 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:90%
the signs of the characters.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
People are always going,
what sign is that character?

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're both Libras.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.407 align:middle line:84%
And Libras are always looking
for the ideal partner.

00:23:06.407 --> 00:23:07.490 align:middle line:90%
And they found each other.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Claudia is a very,
very complex character.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very complex
character-- but also,

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.876 align:middle line:90%
very magnanimous character.

00:23:13.876 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Oh, she's a
very, very loving person,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:90%
very honest, honest woman.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, very much so.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:20.804 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: I
like her honesty.

00:23:20.804 --> 00:23:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so much of this
story is really revealing

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.165 align:middle line:84%
the damage from the 5,000-year
period of patriarchy.

00:23:28.165 --> 00:23:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a superimposed
theme there

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.340 align:middle line:84%
that I don't talk
about much in the book.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:10%
I actually put that more into
the context of the Age of Aries

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:10%
and the Age of Pisces.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Now what am I talking about?

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:46.085 align:middle line:10%
Well, the Age of Pisces
is like 160 BC to now.

00:23:46.085 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Because now we're
going into Aquarius.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:84%
The Age of Aries before the
Age of Pisces is like 2400 BC

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:90%
to 200 BC.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And the Age of Aries
is the age of war.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the Age of Pisces
is the age of wars for God.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And so at this point, these
are the central issues

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
have to transform

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.940 align:middle line:90%
and transcend on this planet.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't so much
go after the patriarchy.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the
patriarchy is simply--

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.925 align:middle line:84%
we actually find that
we all know it, right?

00:24:16.925 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:84%
We've had 5,000
years patriarchy.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But now, by fine tuning it
into the changes of the ages,

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:84%
you get more of a sense of the
things that need to transform.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the change of the
ages from one to the next--

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:84%
we're all really lucky
to be here right now

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:84%
to be living at
the end of Pisces

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and moving into Aquarius, even
though the chaos and confusion

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
is very, very hard on
all of us, because we're

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:84%
going through this
incredible change

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
where everything in
culture, everything

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:90%
is changing right now.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And as we're doing
this interview,

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
there's huge changes in
NATO, huge changes in lots

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.280 align:middle line:90%
of global organizations.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what happens
at the end of an age.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of
the things you say

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:84%
is going to be required to
start healing this and reversing

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:02.260 align:middle line:84%
the energy field of that past
age or epoch period of history

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the
coming together

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and the re-acknowledgment
of feminine principles,

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and energy, and the merging
of the masculine and feminine

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.225 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:25:13.225 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I think a
deeper and more important

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:90%
contribution from me--

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.670 align:middle line:90%
it's in "Aquarian Age."

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm working on it even
more so in the current book--

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:84%
is the issue of the division
between the religions

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:90%
of Abraham.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Now the religions of
Abraham are Judaism, Islam,

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:90%
and Christianity.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened
is the religions--

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:84%
basically Islam
and Christianity,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.050 align:middle line:84%
in particular-- have been
at each other's throats.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in the novel,
we're going back

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years ago to what
happened when Jesus

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:84%
or when Christ was
on this planet.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting a hold
of the things that

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:90%
created the division.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I actually believe that,
if people can see the divisions

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.279 align:middle line:84%
clearly, people are going to
stop fighting with each other.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
what it's going to take

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:90%
to end the wars for God.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big part of the
book that comes up repeatedly.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And last time I saw
you, which was you

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:84%
know in British Columbia, you
turned me on to the book--

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:84%
was it called "The
Jesus Family Tomb?"

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:10%
That's by Simcha Jacobovici.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.370 align:middle line:10%
And this book has a
lot of implications.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Now you talk about the book
in the book you've written.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.130 align:middle line:90%
This does come up.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But why don't you just go
ahead and give the viewers

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
a snippet of the significance
of this particular book?

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
significant theme.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The theme is the
issue of the discovery

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:84%
of the family tomb of the
family of Jesus back in 1980.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons the book
is mentioned is, in the novels,

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:84%
whenever I actually really
cover significant research

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:84%
by a person, I always like
to acknowledge people.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So one of my characters
just said, hey,

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:84%
you got to read that
book, because it

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:90%
says blah, blah, blah.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we're
talking about the book.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But the theme behind
it, which is actually

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
the work of other authors
besides Simcha Jacobovici--

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.200 align:middle line:90%
it's a hard name.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why I didn't
try to say it.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: And
then James Cameron,

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
the director of "Avatar," made
a film with Simcha Jacobovici,

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84%
which viewers may have seen
back in 2007 called "The Jesus

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Family Tomb," where they
actually went down with cameras

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.270 align:middle line:90%
and went into the tomb.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason this is
such a significant theme--

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet, almost
no one heard about it.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I talk to people,
they say, what film?

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.210 align:middle line:90%
What book?

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is an
interesting thing.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things that I love doing

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.340 align:middle line:84%
is finding something
that's really significant

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and then noticing that,
even though a whole lot

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.070 align:middle line:84%
of other people hear about
it, it immediately goes blank.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when people hear
something that goes radically

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.740 align:middle line:84%
against what they've always
been taught to believe,

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.054 align:middle line:90%
their brains tend to go blank.

00:28:04.054 --> 00:28:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So the reason there's a
big blank on this one,

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.928 align:middle line:84%
even though there's been
actually a huge amount

00:28:07.928 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
of publicity about
it, is that people

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
have been so trained to
believe in the Resurrection.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.480 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.637 align:middle line:84%
When Jesus died, he
got resurrected, right?

00:28:17.637 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, the only problem
is, there was a tomb.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:90%
And his body was in it.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
His wife, Mary
Magdalene, the body

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:84%
of a child named Judah, who
was probably their son--

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brother.

00:28:27.135 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Brothers, that's
right-- a lot of people,

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.400 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Jesus had seven siblings.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of people
think that Jesus didn't

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:90%
have any brothers or sisters.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Because of course,
his mother, Mary,

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.600 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have possibly had sex.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's this immaculate
conception still going on.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Couldn't have had
seven immaculate conceptions.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So what happened basically
is-- the real story

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
is Jesus was a real person
and a really fine person,

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:90%
as far as I can tell.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.310 align:middle line:90%
A whole man, a father--

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:84%
why can't a great spiritual
teacher be a father

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.361 align:middle line:90%
and be a husband, after all?

00:28:58.361 --> 00:28:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good question.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Well, why not?

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I admire a person more when they
have a really beautiful family

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:90%
life, as well as their teaching.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So the tomb was
discovered in 1980.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.410 align:middle line:84%
There's been a huge
attempt by the Vatican

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and by the Jewish antiquities
authorities to cover this up.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much
evidence that's

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:90%
been established and proven.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And if people want
to read my novels,

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:84%
they may want to pick up
some of this information

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and start digging
more deeply in it.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.615 align:middle line:84%
Because all I can do is present
characters who talk about this.

00:29:30.615 --> 00:29:32.739 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's why
I wanted to bring it up.

00:29:32.739 --> 00:29:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some people
can get a jump on it

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.489 align:middle line:84%
before even the
third book comes out.

00:29:36.489 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And this may be, possibly,
one of the greatest

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:84%
archaeological discoveries
of the last 100 years.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Now we can understand
why the Vatican church

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.453 align:middle line:90%
would want to cover it up.

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But why would the Israeli
Department of Antiquities

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.770 align:middle line:90%
want to cover it up?

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.811 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Now that is
a complicated question,

00:29:53.811 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:84%
which I could give
you a long answer.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think it
would be too long.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But the Jewish authorities, just
like Christians authorities--

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.850 align:middle line:90%
they also have a fairy story--

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:84%
for example, things
like the Exodus.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just a fairy story.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And so when things come
up archaeologically,

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:84%
when discoveries are made that
go against a prevailing fairy

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.260 align:middle line:90%
story, people start fighting it.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But the reasons that the
Jews have been hiding this

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.400 align:middle line:90%
are very complex.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So moving on
from Jacobovici's work,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.725 align:middle line:84%
we go back to the story and
Armando and this painting

00:30:31.725 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:90%
that's flowing through him.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.090 align:middle line:84%
He's obsessed with doing
this painting, which becomes

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.980 align:middle line:90%
a big revelation at the end.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And it really has to do
with the sacred union that's

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:84%
flowing through him and the
need for this sacred union--

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
again, what we were
talking about earlier.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, imagine this.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.810 align:middle line:10%
He was a big Roman and
European famous painter,

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:10%
mostly famous for
painting triptyches,

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:10%
with the Upper World, the Middle
World, and Lower World in them,

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:10%
like we see in--

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.485 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Like Dante.

00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:10%
>> HAND CLOW: --Medieval
art like Dante, exactly.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, he couldn't
paint his normal painting

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And he just became obsessed with
bringing through this image.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
described in detail

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.450 align:middle line:84%
how he does it, which
is really fascinating.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's an image of Mary
Magdalene on the ground

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and reaching up for Christ,
who is basically ascending.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.920 align:middle line:90%
He's on the verge of taking off.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what happens
further on in the novel is

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:84%
it becomes clearer that the
people who see this painting

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:84%
experience the real
presence of Christ.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's always been an
issue in Catholic religion,

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.955 align:middle line:84%
Christian religion, through
actual, real Christ.

00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was also
through this entanglement

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:90%
of love with this woman.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Well,
that's how it turns out.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out, his
version of the real presence

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.775 align:middle line:84%
involves him being in
love with his wife.

00:31:52.775 --> 00:31:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a whole
big shift in the meaning

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:90%
of the real presence.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a major theme,
of course, going all the way

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:90%
through the book.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing about
that to me-- now, here I am.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I write on the timeline.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, if it's June 2014,
what's going on outside

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.760 align:middle line:84%
the characters is
on the timeline.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So just exactly when Armando was
able to execute that painting

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and bring it in,
a amazing painting

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.730 align:middle line:84%
appeared on the world scene
called "Salvador Mundi"

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:90%
by Leonardo da Vinci.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is a painting of Christ
that was finally authenticated

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:84%
after 500 years of arguing about
whether it's really Leonardo

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:37.230 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So finally, it
was authenticated.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And a Saudi prince fought
it for $45 million.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the world was
able to see this painting.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
saw images of it.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.566 align:middle line:84%
And it's just absolutely the
most astonishing painting.

00:32:51.566 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about it.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: What it is is
just simply the face of Christ.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it, you
can see all of the dimensions

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and all of the cosmic realms
relating to his image.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.500 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.830 align:middle line:84%
But it came in just when
Armando's painting came in.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And I have been
having this experience

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.580 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
the trilogy of things

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.552 align:middle line:84%
happening as I'm
writing that actually--

00:33:13.552 --> 00:33:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You get a download.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And then this shows up in the
international arena somewhere.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.373 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's
some kind of pick-up

00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:90%
that I'm having.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.515 align:middle line:90%
I pick things up that way.

00:33:23.515 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:90%
That's how actually I trust.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Because as I'm in
the third book now,

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:30.180 align:middle line:84%
the degree to which I have
to trust is really intense.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Because now I'm really dealing
with complicated material.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are Yes.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, so now passing
on from what you just

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.640 align:middle line:84%
talked about and this
painting that Armando's done,

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:84%
there is a position in the
book that matrimonial sects

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.985 align:middle line:90%
has a redemptive quality.

00:33:47.985 --> 00:33:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And talk about
this for a little bit.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:84%
At the same time in the middle
of all this stuff coming

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
through, a book has
come through called--

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a book based
on a manuscript that

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.690 align:middle line:84%
was written in the
first or second century

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.990 align:middle line:90%
AD called "Joseph and Aseneth."

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:11.199 align:middle line:84%
And this stuff is
really complicated.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's not that
complicated in the book.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.948 align:middle line:90%
The characters just simply say--

00:34:15.948 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not in
your book, it's not.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:18.289 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: No.

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The characters simply say, I
heard this had been translated.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And Sarah Appel is a
patristic scholar, early

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Christian scholar.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And Claudia is a seeker
of spiritual wisdom.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So they talk about the
meaning of this book.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And what goes on in
this book is this book

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:84%
is a story of the surrogacy
of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:44.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they used to
do this thousands of years

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:47.219 align:middle line:84%
ago, where they would
have a story of someone

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:48.929 align:middle line:90%
like Joseph in Aseneth.

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But what it actually is
is a contemporary story

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.929 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:58.030 align:middle line:10%
So Jacobovici got a hold of--

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:10%
he heard about this early text.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.990 align:middle line:10%
He went to work with a
scholar from Toronto, Barrie

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.170 align:middle line:10%
Wilson, who is a very famous
New Testament scholar.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And they did modern
translations,

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.930 align:middle line:84%
which means all kinds
of special imaging work

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:84%
with ancient manuscripts
of the original manuscript

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.570 align:middle line:90%
in order to get this story out.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's the story
of Jesus falling

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:84%
in love with Mary Magdalene and
the story of their marriage.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.465 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:35:26.465 --> 00:35:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thus, it has
the redemptive qualities

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:28.950 align:middle line:90%
but within that.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.866 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah, well,
it's just beautiful.

00:35:30.866 --> 00:35:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
element coming in.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm doing is as
a writer and a scholar

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.660 align:middle line:84%
is I'm looking for all
of these elements that

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.460 align:middle line:90%
are happening now.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.918 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
major breakthroughs

00:35:39.918 --> 00:35:41.550 align:middle line:90%
that are happening now.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like a wave.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.880 align:middle line:90%
It's like a cascade.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like, after the lights
had been out for a very long

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:50.150 align:middle line:84%
period of time-- which brings us
to the next subject, which is,

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:55.040 align:middle line:84%
a couple of times in
here, you bring up the--

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.480 align:middle line:84%
it's just a quick reference
to the 18th Dynasty.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.830 align:middle line:10%
And why did you go
to the 18th Dynasty?

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:10%
In the book it says
because these people

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.860 align:middle line:10%
were open to many dimensions
of knowledge at the time.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.800 align:middle line:90%
But why bring that up?

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I brought it up specifically
because of the issue

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:90%
of the change of the ages.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Because before
the Age of Aries--

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.720 align:middle line:84%
now that's 4000 to
2000 BC, basically--

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.550 align:middle line:90%
we've got the Age of Taurus.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And we've got an
age that is still

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.420 align:middle line:90%
alive in the 18th Dynasty.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian Pharaonic
cultural period

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:84%
is really about
3,000 years long.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And the 18th Dynasty was
the last dynasty in Egypt

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.890 align:middle line:84%
that still really
had the secret codes.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And so then--

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.398 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The lights
went out after that.

00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Well, they did.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
we have plenty of proof

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.740 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was
initiated in Egypt.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, Mary Magdalene
was a major initiate.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And so if we go back to
the time from 0 to 200 BC

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.220 align:middle line:84%
with the Gnostics and different
great spiritual teachers

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:84%
of the times, there
were still people

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:84%
who were in touch with
this really ancient wisdom.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, there
still are today.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
The Masons are still
in touch with it.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.510 align:middle line:84%
The Templar are still
in touch with this.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:90%
So I brought it into the novel.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Because really, what I'm
doing with this trilogy

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.650 align:middle line:84%
is I'm doing a little
bit of teaching

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.420 align:middle line:90%
about how the ages change.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Because if we go
back 2,000 years,

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.480 align:middle line:84%
back to the time when we
transited into Pisces,

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.700 align:middle line:84%
there still were
spiritual schools,

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.330 align:middle line:84%
like Pythagorean mystery schools
and tonic mystery schools,

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:84%
who were teaching
people about how

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:84%
to handle it when
one age goes away

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.130 align:middle line:90%
and the new one is coming in.

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And don't you think we
need that at this point?

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Judging by
what's happening out there.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you are providing
some guidance in this.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: I'm doing that.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And other people are doing
that, too, of course.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Because we need guidance.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the vortex point, the
shift from one to the other,

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:90%
it's like being in a tornado.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll give
you one little hint

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.270 align:middle line:84%
about the third
book, if you want it?

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: OK.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:84%
In the period when we transited
out of Aries into Pisces,

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:84%
the key figure who
really stripped away

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the old stuff
and created something new

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.390 align:middle line:90%
is Saint Paul.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:11.680 align:middle line:10%
And so Christianity is actually
really Pauline Christianity.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.660 align:middle line:10%
It's not really authentic
Christianity, which

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.440 align:middle line:10%
would be Jewish Christianity.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's, of course,
covered in detail in the book.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But I just knew
that covering that--

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Saint Paul as a
changeover person--

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was important.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And so fortunately,
as I go further along,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:90%
I did pick the right pieces.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You did.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.520 align:middle line:90%
And you went further in the day.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:10%
And you had the
followers of James,

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:10%
which was a completely different
expression of Christianity,

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.110 align:middle line:10%
the Ebionites,

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:10%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah, the
Ebionites or the Ebionites

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.880 align:middle line:10%
in Nazarene.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
names for them.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
spiritual Jews of the time.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Then Jesus came.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And Jesus was a Jew, of course.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they converted
to Christianity.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And they started creating
early Christian churches

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:90%
and Christian sects.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.221 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
Marcion is important--

00:39:01.221 --> 00:39:02.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
the John the Baptist?

00:39:02.845 --> 00:39:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: --in
the "Ruby Crystal."

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who were the
followers of John the Baptist?

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.970 align:middle line:90%
Was that the Marcionites?

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: No, the Marcion
comes along basically almost

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:90%
100 AD.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
He comes along even
after Saint Paul.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And Marcion was
working with a lot

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:84%
of the issues Jewish Christians
were working with, which was--

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:90%
it's simple.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:84%
This all sounds
really complicated.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.540 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:84%
The issue was we got to get
rid of the old God, Yahweh.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Because Yahweh basically
is a God of the law

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:90%
and a God of war.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Because Jesus was
certainly a God of love.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that issue is going to
come up as we go into Aquarius.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Who is going to be the spiritual
teacher of the Age of Aquarius?

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.780 align:middle line:90%
So this is going to be an issue.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And it'll develop over a
couple of hundred years.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:90%
So the Marcionites--

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.720 align:middle line:84%
I covered them extensively,
because they're

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:84%
considered to be the
greatest heretics

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.290 align:middle line:90%
in the history of Christianity.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back to
150 BC, the Marcionites

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:84%
had more bishops and more
parishes on this planet

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.100 align:middle line:90%
than the Roman Catholics did.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Roman Catholics managed
to excommunicate Marcion

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:10.960 align:middle line:90%
and edge him out.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he
rejected the wrathful God.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Basically,
because they wanted the power.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It's always like that.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.560 align:middle line:84%
They did, but he
was rejecting, yes.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so it's interesting.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Because you get into these famed
characters of the day, James,

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Paul-- who was Saul--

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:90%
John the Baptist.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So all of that is
part of the framework

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.260 align:middle line:84%
of this ancient story
in this age that's

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:90%
now drawing to a close.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And you also write about the
fall of Atlantis a little bit.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.462 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about that part

00:40:44.462 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:90%
of the backdrop of the story.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:46.470 align:middle line:90%
And people can see.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:50.260 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge amount of
historical information coming

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.270 align:middle line:84%
in through these
characters, each

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.470 align:middle line:90%
with their unique expertise.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: But it comes
through in conversation.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:55.893 align:middle line:90%
It's all conversation.

00:40:55.893 --> 00:40:56.160 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.785 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah, and another
thing that was really fun about

00:40:58.785 --> 00:41:01.480 align:middle line:84%
writing this is there's always
a couple of characters who know

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.479 align:middle line:84%
it all and can talk
about it intelligently.

00:41:04.479 --> 00:41:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's always at
least one or two characters

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.690 align:middle line:90%
who go, but wait.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:08.629 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:41:08.629 --> 00:41:09.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which draws out--

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So the reader is
never left abandoned.

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:15.280 align:middle line:84%
There's always a
character who knows

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:84%
less than the reader knows
so that we can bring you up

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.902 align:middle line:90%
to snuff.

00:41:19.902 --> 00:41:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Atlantis
part of the story.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So actually, the
trilogy actually

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:29.440 align:middle line:84%
is good to go back
to 19,000 years ago.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It's going back into
the Paleolithic era.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:35.920 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the issue
of Atlantis is concerned,

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.906 align:middle line:84%
Armando has a really interesting
complex that you might not

00:41:38.906 --> 00:41:40.030 align:middle line:90%
have picked out by reading.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:43.240 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those
backdrop things in a book

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that you go, oh, I see
that that's behind that.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:10%
And what happened with
Armando is something

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.530 align:middle line:10%
that happens with everybody
who experiences sexual trauma,

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:56.080 align:middle line:10%
as far as I can tell, which is--

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.360 align:middle line:10%
I've written another
book years ago called

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.640 align:middle line:10%
"Catastrophobia," which is now
titled "Awakening the Planetary

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.440 align:middle line:10%
Mind."

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.570 align:middle line:10%
The publisher changed the title.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:10%
"Catastrophobia"
covers 20,000 years

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:10%
of human history and
deals with a cataclysm

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:10%
that occurred on our planet
around 11,500 or 12,000 years

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.280 align:middle line:10%
ago, where our planet was
basically blown to smithereens.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And this, in culture, is
known as the Fall of Atlantis.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
everybody duns that.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:25.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's a true story.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
experience abuse--

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:84%
which, of course,
Armando did when

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.110 align:middle line:90%
he was only seven years old--

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:36.160 align:middle line:84%
what happens is the kind
of retrogressive traumatic

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.150 align:middle line:84%
complexes that all of us are
carrying in our cellular memory

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.460 align:middle line:90%
is brought to the surface.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And so Armando's father,
who is his teacher,

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.930 align:middle line:84%
knows that he has
to help Armando deal

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.540 align:middle line:84%
with the story of
the cataclysm as he's

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.600 align:middle line:90%
healing from his sexual trauma.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be a major
theme in the third book, where

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.360 align:middle line:84%
people are going to be really
hitting the wall on this one.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Because, as we go into
Aquarius, clearing

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:84%
the memories of the
cataclysm and clearing

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.037 align:middle line:90%
the emotional trauma--

00:43:07.037 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The mass trauma.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.453 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: --the mass trauma.

00:43:09.453 --> 00:43:12.422 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all in the middle
of a mass trauma awakening.

00:43:12.422 --> 00:43:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But at
the same time, you

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.840 align:middle line:84%
insert another story, which is
that the elites conveniently

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.420 align:middle line:84%
created this story that man was
responsible for the cataclysm,

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:84%
which has created
a very deep guilt

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:84%
complex in those who would
be privy to that information.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Guilt and that those
kinds of feelings

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.996 align:middle line:84%
make us more controllable,
more exploitable.

00:43:33.996 --> 00:43:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.890 align:middle line:90%
So we have the cataclysm.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the elite comes
in and takes control.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they had more power
all the way through 8000, 6000,

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:84%
5000, 3000 BC or whatever,
then the patriarchy builds up.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that's important

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.590 align:middle line:84%
is to make people feel
like they caused it.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.385 align:middle line:84%
Because then they feel
guilty, and you get control.

00:43:57.385 --> 00:43:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know,
Barbara, eight years ago, I

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:01.756 align:middle line:90%
was regressed by Delores Cannon.

00:44:01.756 --> 00:44:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking I was
going to something

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I had a little heart
heartache over.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Boom, I end up in Atlantis
and not knowing which era,

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.434 align:middle line:90%
since it seemed to have--

00:44:10.434 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: It has
a number of stages.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It had a number of
stages of its destruction.

00:44:13.605 --> 00:44:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I wasn't really
clear on that part of it,

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.790 align:middle line:84%
except for what happened
in this event, which

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:23.090 align:middle line:84%
was extremely visceral, more
visceral than being here.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And in it, what
I was doing was--

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:28.250 align:middle line:84%
there was a certain
amount of blame going on.

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I understood
that there were

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:33.290 align:middle line:84%
people working with
technology to do something.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And this was becoming
extraordinarily destabilized.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I was working with natural
energies along with other women

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to help stabilize what
was going on at the time.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Now when the event happened--
this was the final day before

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.800 align:middle line:90%
the event--

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.360 align:middle line:90%
I started noticing something.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:90%
And I said, this is interesting.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:56.690 align:middle line:84%
There are spacecraft hovering in
the near atmosphere over here.

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:58.890 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be doing something.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they're taking certain
people out of here or whatnot.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, this same
story was invalidated

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.637 align:middle line:84%
by two other people who had
had the same experience.

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, I
wasn't making things up.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's into Delores' book,
"Convoluted Universe Two."

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.320 align:middle line:10%
But what happened was
this awful feeling

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.150 align:middle line:10%
of having lost so
much that we would

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:10%
be completely traumatized.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying
to her, we're going

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.669 align:middle line:84%
to sleep for a
very long time now.

00:45:21.669 --> 00:45:22.710 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to sleep.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was crying at this point.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Later on, I talked
with some other people

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.820 align:middle line:90%
who experienced this.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.280 align:middle line:90%
And this is what came up.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
resonate so strongly.

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:33.961 align:middle line:90%
I was cloistered.

00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't really
clear what these people

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:90%
were doing technologically.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that things
were becoming more and more

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.960 align:middle line:90%
destabilized, so to speak.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.130 align:middle line:90%
And I had kind of a--

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.500 align:middle line:90%
in this time, a blaming of that.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
did at that time--

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.290 align:middle line:90%
and in this time, a blaming.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was said, no, these
were natural forces that

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:84%
were building up over a
very long period of time.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And I could see,
we had been trying

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.860 align:middle line:84%
to work with that
energy for generations.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.380 align:middle line:84%
It was building up over a
very long period of time.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.314 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to use
technology to subdue it.

00:46:03.314 --> 00:46:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: And this is what's
going on now, isn't it, Regina?

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't it?

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it up, because I
thought we were to blame, too.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.250 align:middle line:90%
And we were not.

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, right now
on this planet,

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is another reason I
think understanding

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.260 align:middle line:90%
this transition is so important.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the
transition to Aquarius

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:20.590 align:middle line:90%
is going to be different.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I do not see major
cataclysmic destruction

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:25.450 align:middle line:90%
as you go into Aquarius.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But we're certainly
going to be dealing

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:30.550 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of climate change
and a lot of cyclical change.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are going to be
cataclysmic things that

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.240 align:middle line:90%
happen--

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.830 align:middle line:84%
nothing like what
happened before.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nothing
like that, yeah.

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: So I'm
covering it in the book.

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.150 align:middle line:84%
In the third book,
I'm going more deeply

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.542 align:middle line:84%
into what's going
on now in terms

00:46:42.542 --> 00:46:44.500 align:middle line:84%
of how to handle what's
actually happening now.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really starting
to roll at this point.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we only have
a couple minutes left.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.350 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of this takes
place in the backdrop

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:54.070 align:middle line:84%
of the city of Siena, which
is an interesting city.

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:57.660 align:middle line:90%
I felt, when I was in Siena--

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.510 align:middle line:90%
I love the Duomo.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:59.680 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But I just felt a heaviness
and darkness there.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: This
is a heaviness there.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -- that I
didn't want to stay in.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And so my son and I beat it out
of town after a couple of days.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was so surprised
to see, in the book,

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:12.394 align:middle line:84%
you write about the energies
of the city of Siena.

00:47:12.394 --> 00:47:13.768 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW:
Yeah, that's right.

00:47:13.768 --> 00:47:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the energies of
Siena are very, very major

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:17.680 align:middle line:90%
and also Orvieto--

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.240 align:middle line:90%
more so in the third book.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Because there's this issue
of Calleman's midline

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:24.872 align:middle line:84%
and being a major
geological change--

00:47:24.872 --> 00:47:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Carl Calleman, yes.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: --on the planet.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Carl Calleman, right.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.127 align:middle line:90%
And it goes right through Italy.

00:47:29.127 --> 00:47:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And it goes right
through this region.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:33.250 align:middle line:84%
It goes through Rome,
Orvieto, and Siena.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So what you're feeling really
is the energy of the midline.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:38.590 align:middle line:84%
But in Siena, there's
also some extra energy,

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:42.595 align:middle line:84%
which I'm going into
more in the third book.

00:47:42.595 --> 00:47:43.470 align:middle line:90%
You're right, though.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:44.303 align:middle line:90%
You picked up on it.

00:47:44.303 --> 00:47:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, well,
I'm super energy sensitive.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And I love the fact
that I could have access

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.994 align:middle line:90%
to so much information.

00:47:51.994 --> 00:47:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Because of what I
do for a living,

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.720 align:middle line:84%
so much of what I've
already been exposed to,

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:59.140 align:middle line:84%
true-- some new, but all
brought together in one place

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.170 align:middle line:84%
through these intelligent,
savvy characters.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So you did it in a
very effective way.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.505 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end of the book,
many revelations have come up.

00:48:07.505 --> 00:48:08.380 align:middle line:90%
They're all together.

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And they say, we
must meet again.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:12.746 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
oh, I can't wait

00:48:12.746 --> 00:48:15.160 align:middle line:84%
to see Barbara and pick her
brain at dinner about what

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.220 align:middle line:90%
the new storyline is all about.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: I don't
know where it's going.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:18.715 align:middle line:90%
I'm just letting it happen.

00:48:18.715 --> 00:48:19.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what the title is.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm really
glad you took up fiction.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.081 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:48:24.081 --> 00:48:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Well, thank you.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.130 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
rebelled against this.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But gradually, piece by piece,
they're starting to realize--

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.290 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm not only
doing the same thing,

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.690 align:middle line:84%
but I'm now doing it in
a multi-dimensional way.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the ultimate effect
of taking this information in

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.980 align:middle line:84%
is you're starting to
activate different dimensions

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.210 align:middle line:90%
in your consciousness.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And I firmly believe, as
a teacher and a healer,

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.215 align:middle line:90%
that we must do this now.

00:48:47.215 --> 00:48:48.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the most important.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We must.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: We talked about
that in the interview yesterday

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.150 align:middle line:90%
about why that's so important.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We did.

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have to live this
reality through our bodies.

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: People want Gerry
and I to show up and just teach

00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:59.040 align:middle line:90%
workshops for everybody.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.146 align:middle line:84%
But we can't teach
workshops for everybody,

00:49:01.146 --> 00:49:02.770 align:middle line:84%
although we're going
to do what we can.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.080 align:middle line:10%
So that's why I wrote a
fictional trilogy in order

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.560 align:middle line:10%
to help people experience
multi-dimensionality

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.890 align:middle line:10%
through these characters.

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, you've done a lovely job.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And I can't wait
for the third one.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Thank you.

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What year is the
third one coming out, 2019?

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.924 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: No, because the
timeline's 2018 through 2020.

00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So does it
have to come out in 2020?

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.756 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: It has
to come out in 2021.

00:49:24.756 --> 00:49:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> HAND CLOW: Because we've
got to finish the timeline.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we have
a couple of years to wait.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:29.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Again, thank you, Barbara.

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.587 align:middle line:84%
As always, it's absolutely
wonderful sitting with you.

00:49:34.587 --> 00:49:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> HAND CLOW: Thank you, Regina.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the name
of Barbara's new novel

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.760 align:middle line:84%
is "Revelations of the
Aquarian Age," which

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.852 align:middle line:84%
introduced a great deal
of little-known esoteric

00:49:41.852 --> 00:49:43.060 align:middle line:90%
knowledge, as you just heard.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:46.140 align:middle line:10%
You can find it at major
booksellers, as well as

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.110 align:middle line:10%
the previous book, "Revelations
of the Ruby Crystal."

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.180 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.240 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."

00:49:53.240 --> 00:50:01.899 align:middle line:90%
